      <text>So first of all it has to be mentioned that the right to broadcast in this case must be subjected to legal regulations and the government remind and recall including to the applicant that it had been sanctioned about 20 times for various reasons and each time the council decided to apply milder sanctions even if the very first time it could have been a public warning and the second could have been a pecuniary fine, the third could have been a suspension for 5, 3, 30 days and so on but and then the fifth one could have been the withdrawal of the license.</text>

      <text>However the government want to stress that these 18 sanctions could have probably been just 5 or 6 before the withdrawal of the license but the government and the authorities decided to sanction the applicant company about 18 times before withdrawing that license for only that period of time.</text>

      <text>Also the government submitted in their observations explicit information about the broadcasters that had been sanctioned during that period of time and we reiterate it was not just the applicant company, it was also the public broadcaster and other private broadcasters for various shortcomings, for various violations and I reiterate the main difference between the applicant and the other one sanctioned was that the other ones did comply with those sanctions and they did re-enter legality whereas the applicant just chose to disregard any of those sanctions and just continued the same editorial policy and the same lack of pluralism either internal or external.</text>

      <text>Concerning judges Barton and Pavley's questions about article 3810 and 388 of that law, the code, well, it was changed after the revocation, after the withdrawal of this license and we don't really see any connection with this case since it occurred later on but in any way the constitutional court mentioned about the fact that it didn't need to pronounce itself on the abstract proportionality of the sanction because it basically referred itself to the lack of procedural guarantees of that provision.</text>

      <text>And referring to judges Pavley's question about the recommendation concerning the two thirds of the members of parliament for electing the members of the audiovisual council, the government would like to mention or to know that whenever we had the presidential republic, I mean when the president was elected by the parliament itself, it was very complicated to achieve two thirds of the members of parliament or the majority of two thirds in this case.</text>

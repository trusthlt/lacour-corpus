      <text>Indeed, our submission is that the Civil Partnerships Act itself, the legislation at issue in this case, permitted conscientious objection because it did not oblige the local authorities to designate all marriage registrars as civil partnership registrars, but simply required them to ensure that they had sufficient civil partnership registrars in their area for the service of civil partnership to be provided.</text>

      <text>Whether or not that is the appropriate test where the allegation is of a breach of Article 9, and we would say it is not, we submit it most certainly cannot be the appropriate test where the complaint is of discrimination under Article 14, and the question is merely whether the treatment is within the ambit of Article 9.</text>

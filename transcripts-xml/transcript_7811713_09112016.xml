      <text>From 2008 on, a restriction was introduced in respect of pensioner employees not having reached the retirement age, under which, upon reaching a work income ceiling first 12 times, then 18 times, of the minimum wage, pension disbursements had to be suspended irrespective of whether it was earned in the private or the public sector.</text>

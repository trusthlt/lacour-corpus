      <text>The civil code clearly excluded claims arising of ecclesiastical law from the scope of civil rights, and even declared any contract signed for securing an obligatio naturalis to be null and void, thus the dispute concerning the non-fulfillment of such an obligation cannot be regarded as a genuine dispute under civil law for the purposes of Article VI.</text>

      <text>In the written memorial, the government submitted a number of alternative pleadings, but they are only relevant if the court adopts a wrong starting point by concluding that Article VI is applicable, that the domestic courts wrongly interpreted Hungarian law, and the applicant had a genuine civil law claim under Hungarian law, or that the applicant was prevented from enforcing his pecuniary claims before a Hungarian court, not by a rule of substantive law excluding his claims from the scope of civil rights, but by a procedural obstacle.</text>

      <text>Forced to take this wrong starting point, the government would argue that the applicant has waived his right of access to secular courts by opting for entering into a legal relationship governed by ecclesiastical law, or that the lack of jurisdiction of Hungarian courts was justified by the freedom of religion and the constitutional principle of secularity without disproportionately affecting the applicant's pecuniary interests, since the jurisdiction of secular courts was excluded only in matters governed exclusively by ecclesiastical law, while the churches and their employees remain free to conclude an employment contract governed by the rules of state law, subject to enforcement by state courts and churches, don't enjoy immunity from state courts' jurisdiction in any legal dispute governed by state law.</text>

      <text>Instead, I would like to draw the court's attention to the case law of British courts, which in a different legal system, reached the same conclusion about the nature of the service as a church minister, as did the Hungarian legislature, and do not recognize the relationship between the minister and his or her church as an employment relationship unless it is expressly stipulated so by the parties in a contract.</text>

			<Text>In my intervention, I will focus on three points.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>521.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>535.14</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>First, I will address questions related to Article I of the convention and demonstrate that neither the airstrike nor the ensuing investigations established German jurisdiction.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>535.14</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>548.98</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Second, I will demonstrate that if the court wants to consider the merits of the case, it should conclude that Germany has complied with its obligation to investigate under the procedural limb of Article II.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>548.98</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>558.86</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And third, I will show that the applicant was entitled to legal remedies before German courts that are adequate and effective.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>558.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>563.66</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So let us look at the question of principle that arises in this case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>563.66</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>579.46</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Does the European Convention on Human Rights oblige Germany to investigate an incident, even though it has taken place in Afghanistan in the context of military missions authorized by the United Nations Security Council?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>579.46</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>581.5</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>581.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>584.82</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The convention does not apply in such a case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>584.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>586.74</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There are two reasons.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>586.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>596.3</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>One, the acts are not attributable to Germany because the airstrike was carried out on behalf of the United Nations.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>596.3</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>601.5</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The conclusion is based on this court's decision in the Birrami case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>601.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>610.9</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Birrami jurisprudence remains essential for delineating the relationship between the European Convention and the United Nations Charter.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>610.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>622.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It acknowledges the unique responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security as a primary objective of the UN Charter.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>622.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>631.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it preserves the fundamental role of the member states for the effective implementation of UN Security Council resolutions.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>631.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>638.18</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>For this reasons, the measure taken are outside the jurisdiction of the court, Razione Persone.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>638.18</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>643.22</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>No investigative duty under the convention can arise.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>643.22</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>660.3</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The second reason why the convention does not apply to the case before you is that the airstrike constituted an extraterritorial act, but not an exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction in the meaning of Article 1.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>660.3</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>672.86</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The court has constantly held that the convention's extraterritorial application is exceptional and requires special justification in the specific circumstances of each case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>672.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>678.82</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Article 1 reflects the ordinary, essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>678.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>687.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the Bankovic case, the court expressly stated that Article 1 should not be subject to dynamic interpretation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>687.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>690.02</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The reasons for this are twofold.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>690.02</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>702.06</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>First, the concept of jurisdiction is the threshold criterion for applying the entire convention system and thus for establishing a contracting state's responsibility.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>702.06</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>715.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, states can only comply with their obligations where they assert sufficient physical control and legal authority to be able to fulfill their duties.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>715.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>729.34</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, the duty to secure to everyone the protection of the convention must depend on the existence of a clearly delineated jurisdictional link, a link that is territorial in most cases.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>729.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>738.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Secondly, the contracting parties have consented to this essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction and continue to do so.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>738.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>750.26</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>From the outset, Article 1 was meant to guarantee that all persons physically present on the territory of the contracting states enjoy the convention's protection.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>750.26</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>770.06</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The contracting parties have continuously embraced this essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction, and the observations submitted by the governments of Denmark, France, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom in the present proceedings reflect this ongoing consent.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>770.06</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>780.82</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Having said that, in the present case, no reasons whatsoever can be found to justify the extraterritorial application of the convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>780.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>786.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Germany did not exercise effective control over the Kunduz region.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>786.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>802.42</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this respect, the circumstances of the Bankovic case are highly comparable to the present case because Bankovic also deals with the deaths of civilians caused by airstrikes of NATO forces outside the contracting state.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>802.42</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>807.98</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>An airstrike is not sufficient to establish a state's control over a certain region.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>814.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>820.82</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8570.73</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8596.87</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We agree with the submission that was made by Denmark in its written submissions as to the relevant IHL obligations, and it's paragraph 28 of the Danish written submissions, where they say that investigations must live up to the standards under IHL and human rights law of independence, impartiality, thoroughness, effectiveness, promptness, transparency.</Text>

			<Text>Third point on this issue, the relationship between IHL standards and the convention standards.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8607.73</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8621.13</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Even in Hassan, where this court interpreted Article V in the light of IHL, the court was clear that the rules of the normal convention standards do not disappear.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8621.13</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8632.05</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So in particular, in relation to the procedural obligations under Article V, the court was clear that there must be sufficient guarantees of impartiality, independence, and fairness.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8632.05</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8639.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And we would argue that even if IHL were to apply, the normal convention standards would continue to operate in the background.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8639.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8663.99</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Finally, in relation to Judge Turkovich's question about the ICC statute, I think here we can agree with the submissions that were made by Professor Krieger, which is to say that what that provision emphasizes is an obligation on the German government to investigate with respect to issues that would fall within the scope of the ICC statute.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8663.99</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8679.87</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And so if you apply the Guzel-Yutlu case and one thinks about the special features that might create a jurisdictional link, the fact that there are these international law obligations is emphasized by the ICC statute.</Text>

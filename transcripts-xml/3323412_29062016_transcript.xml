			<Text>Thank you for giving me the floor, Madam President, Honourable Members of the Court.</Text>

			<Text>We appear before you today to present the Romanian Government's position in this case concerning the alleged secret detention and ill-treatment of the applicant Abdal Rahim Husein Muhammad Al-Mashiri on Romanian soil.</Text>

			<Text>Following the questions that this Court indicated the parties were to answer during this public hearing, I will, in the first part of our intervention, address the issue of state's responsibility in connection to the events invoked by the applicant's representatives.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>306.28</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>324.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I will then kindly ask you to give the floor to my colleague, who will present our arguments on the effectiveness of the investigation carried out by the Romanian authorities, both prior and subsequent to the criminal complaint lodged by the applicant's representatives before the domestic investigative bodies.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>324.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>335.56</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Madam President, before plunging into the issue of state's responsibility, allow us to make some preliminary remarks on the general context of the case and on its admissibility.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>335.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>344.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Firstly, as a member of the international community, Romania is profoundly attached to the values of democracy, rule of law, promotion and protection of human rights.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>344.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>355.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The issue of alleged secret detention, flights and facilities was always approached in the spirit of sharing the universally recognised foundations of a democratic state.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>355.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>365.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Government could not but regret the treatment the applicant was subjected to, treatment documented by official information released by third countries on this issue.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>365.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>372.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As the Court rightly put it, torture and ill-treatment are not acceptable, not even in the harshest circumstances.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>372.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>381.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Still, the Government maintained their position that no proof emerged to confirm that such treatment occurred under Romanian jurisdiction.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>381.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>400.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this context, we consider appropriate to underline from the very beginning that there was no blunt denial regarding the CIA HVD programmes, nor did our State reject in a rigid and arbitrary manner the allegations concerning its potential involvement in these programmes.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>400.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>421.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The negative answer to the existence of suspected flights or secret detention facilities was given by our authorities after consultation, inquiry, in a manner of cooperation that was not always recognised by the different international investigations, but that is showed by various responses that we will present during these oral pleadings.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>421.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>435.28</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, we consider it deplorable that inferences of critical weight have been drawn from the negative answer alone, without just significance being attributed to the cooperative spirit shown by the authorities.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>435.28</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>448.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is not possible, nor admissible, to consider that only a positive answer to these allegations would satisfy the threshold of cooperation and transparency required by these international demarches.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>448.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>461.32</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Secondly, before addressing the merits of the case, we would like to reiterate that we maintain all the objections as to the admissibility of the present application as detailed in our written submissions.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>461.32</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>466.88</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Government does not ignore the Court's findings in its recent Nasser and Ghali judgement.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>466.88</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>485.34</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Still, as required by the principles of subsidiarity and legal certainty, this Court can only be seized with an application once the existing domestic remedies have been exhausted and only in a time limit of six months from the final domestic decision.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>485.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>499.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the case at hand, we cannot but notice that the applicant's representatives lodged the present application two days after presenting a criminal complaint before the Romanian competent investigative body.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>499.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>511.32</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>While we accept that with the passing of time, the objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies could find itself obsolete, in the present situation, the facts point to the contrary.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>511.32</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>525.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The domestic investigation is still ongoing, and even if the investigative phase were before the prosecutor were completed, the solution would at least be submitted to a Court for a legality evaluation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>525.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>528.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This evaluation could lead to the reopening of the investigation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>528.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>536.78</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>At the same time, the investigative phase could end with an indictment, and criminal proceedings before Court would follow.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>536.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>545.76</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the introduction of the criminal complaint lead the Government to invoke the non-respect of the six-month rule.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>545.76</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>561.9</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thus, the applicant's representatives themselves acknowledged that the criminal complaint was filed only as a precautionary measure, the applicant believing from the start that domestic remedies in Romania were plainly ineffective.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>561.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>570.72</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The attitude is also confirmed by the more than limited interest manifested by the applicant's representatives for the internal investigation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>570.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>588.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>For a period of two and a half years, they did not take any step in order to participate in the criminal investigation, and when they finally did, they asked for a piece of information that was already in their possession, namely the number allotted to the criminal investigation file.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>588.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>611.28</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>At this point of our oral submission, we have to stress that in his application lodged against Poland on 6 May 2011, the applicant affirmed that he was moved from Guantanamo Bay to Rabat and then to another CIA prison in Bucharest, Romania, sometime after 27 March 2004.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>611.28</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>626.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It follows that even though the applicant had knowledge about Romania's alleged involvement in his secret detention, at least from 6 May 2011, he chose to refer his accusations to the Romanian authorities and to this court only a year later.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>626.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>650.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant explained this delay by showing that only on 8 December 2011 did details relating to the precise location of the prison in Romania become known, without arguing why the alleged location of the secret prison on Romanian territory had such an important bearing on his decision to present an application against our state.</Text>

			<Text>Madam President, Honorable Judges, with your kind permission, I will now address the issue of state responsibility.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>657.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>665.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this matter, as your court constantly accepted, the necessary reference is to general international law standards.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>665.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>677.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>According to international law, in order for an act to be classified as an international wrongful act engaging the state's responsibility, that act must be attributable to a state.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>677.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>707.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Summarizing the principles of responsibility codified by the International Law Commission on this topic, one could refer either to direct knowledge and involvement in an international wrongful conduct, or to the indirect knowledge inferred from the assumption that a state exercising its jurisdiction over its territory should not ignore the perpetration of the international wrongful act within the border of its territorial jurisdiction.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>707.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>723.28</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>For the purpose of better understanding the responsibility that would have been engaged had there been in Romania a secret detention facility, it is necessary to distinguish from the perspective of state responsibility different scenarios on the state's attitude and conduct.</Text>

			<Text>Its potential agreement on putting a facility at the disposal of another state, its knowledge on the exact purpose of the operation of a secret detention facility, the exercise of state's authority over that facility, the knowingly permitted use of its territory for activities implying human rights violations.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>742.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>764.76</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Madam President, no information was put forward by the documents and other evidence adduced to the file of this case by the international inquiries or by the non-governmental sources to indicate that the Romanian authorities put in place and ran, autonomously or in cooperation with a third state, such a secret detention facility.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>764.76</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>780.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>No information advanced the idea that the Romanian authorities knowingly and expressly accepted, after being briefed on the goal or activities that were to be performed in that facility, to put such a location at the disposal of third parties.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>780.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>794.68</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, the only possible approach from the state's responsibility perspective would be to determine if it had knowingly permitted its territory being used by another state for activities implying human rights violations.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>794.68</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>819.52</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this case, the question is whether, following public awareness regarding the secret detention program, the authorities should have become aware of the fact that the flights operated on the territory of Romania were CIA-operated flights, and from this they should have inferred that there was a secret detention facility in Romania as well, and act in accordance with their obligation of due diligence.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>819.52</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>824.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>844.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this case, decided by the International Court of Justice, the world jurisdiction established the threshold required for circumstantial evidences underlying that, quote, a charge of such exceptional gravity against the state would require a degree of certainty, end quote.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>844.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>866.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Moreover, the ICJ considered that, quote, it cannot be concluded from the mere facts of the control exercised by a state over its territory and waters that that state necessarily knew or ought to have known of any unlawful act perpetrated therein, nor yet that it necessarily knew or should have known the authors.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>866.96</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>877.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>885.8</TimestampEnd>

			<Text>Madam President, your court also accepts that with regard to the establishment of facts and the assessment of evidence, only the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear, and coherent inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact may be considered as proof.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>5910.51</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5930.51</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Well, there is a very simple explanation why we have waited for such an indication to become publicly known. We expected the sort of attitude that the domestic authorities actually had, the blunt denial and the requirement on us to provide as many information as possible.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>

			<TimestampBegin>5945.51</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>With respect to Judge Spanos' question as to what we consider to be proven with respect to enhanced interrogation techniques, it is the applicant's position that in light of the extreme secrecy associated with the program, that we cannot rule out the possibility that he might have been subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>6465.19</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6490.23</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This said, the finding by the court that the totality of circumstances that the applicant was subjected to clearly amounted to torture and treatment in violation of Article III, we submit, is entirely warranted by the evidence in this case.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6490.23</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6537.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And in support, I would draw the court's attention to 18 months of incommunicado detention and enforced disappearance to which the applicant was subjected, the evidence of rectal feeding, which the Senate report said was applied without medical necessity and as used as a method of behavior control, the conditions of confinement that are documented in a number of documents that were recognized by the court in Al-Nashri versus Poland, including the document signed by George Tenet and another from the CIA relating to Rizzo's office, John Rizzo's office.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6537.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6551.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And these conditions of confinement included continued subjection to bright lights, continued subjection to loud noise, shackling, blindfolding, hooding, force shaving.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6551.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6577.95</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And in fact, as expert three categorically said in yesterday's fact-finding hearing that drugging and beating were also such kinds of sort of routine elements of the treatment to which prisoners were subjected along with the conditions of confinement documented in numerous official US government documents.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6577.95</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6608.19</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Then also, as I mentioned in my opening statement, the court in Abu Zubaydah versus Poland recognized that the mere fact of secret detention combined with the uncertainty of being detained at the hands of the CIA itself inflicted intense mental suffering on the applicant, another element of the treatment and violation of Article III that the applicant was subjected to.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6608.19</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6620.43</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And then finally, the personal characteristics of the victim are also relevant for determining the standard of ill treatment that he was subjected to.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6620.43</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6659.75</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I'll draw the court's attention to numerous documents in the record that demonstrate that the applicant was psychologically utterly broken as a result of the CIA detention program, including the transcript testimony of Sandra Crosby, who said that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, and also, in fact, numerous passages from the Senate report itself, the US Senate report itself, that document the severe psychological breakdown to which the applicant was subjected.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6661.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6683.19</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>With respect to Judge Stratianu's question, the expert testimony of expert number three yesterday indicated that the applicant was likely taken to Lithuania after his detention in Romania.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6683.23</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6700.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But in relation to your question as to whether that aggravated the legal position of the applicant, the answer is most certainly yes, because he remained in continued CIA secret detention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6701.27</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6727.75</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And so for all of the reasons that the court found that there were violations of the convention by Poland in permitting the detainees transfer from Polish territory into further secret detention in CIA custody, the same logic applies with respect to Romania, because he was not suddenly free and being subjected to criminal process in Lithuania, or indeed any other country.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6727.75</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6732.59</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>He was subjected to the CIA secret detention program.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6733.75</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6758.55</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I just draw the court's attention to the fact that certainly that risk, Romania was on notice of that risk of continued secret detention, continued ill treatment, the possibility of an unfair trial by military commission that's all clearly set out in our application, the military commission's order number one that was issued in 2001, and the death penalty.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6761.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6771.25</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>All of that, the Romanian government was on notice of as of the time of transfer, which we heard yesterday occurred in 2005.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6773.07</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6794.09</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And so certainly that is, according to the court's caseload, that is the point of time that you should consider for determining that the country was on notice that transfer was taking place in the face of these real risks of further ill treatment, death penalty, fragrantly unfair trial, secret detention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6794.09</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6800.71</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But the court has also found that it is entitled to take into account post-transfer facts.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6800.71</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6830.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And again, I would point, I would respectfully submit that the evidence in this record is replete with information that demonstrates that the real risks that existed as of the point of transfer from Romanian territory continued and in fact manifested while he was held in Lithuania and indeed while he's held in Guantanamo Bay.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6830.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6846.23</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And then finally, I would just submit that in, it is perplexing that the government continues to believe that there is not sufficient evidence to demonstrate that there was a secret CIA prison on Romanian territory.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6846.23</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6853.43</TimestampEnd>

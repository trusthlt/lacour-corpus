			<Text>but even if one was to apply a more detailed test, the applicants would still be able to demonstrate the respondent exercised detailed control over the NKR's policy towards Azeri IDPs, from the respondent's preventative policy towards their return, to the failed submission of the NKR legislature extinguishing property rights of the applicants in 1998, on to the 2012 new claim that the applicants were always at liberty to enter Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh to file claims.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>6969.46</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6989.46</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>7019.46</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>7030.46</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7056.46</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And just lastly, you can examine that within the context of your own judgment of 2011 in December where in actual fact you had to entertain the submission relied upon by the Armenian government, firstly that the NKR legislature had extinguished the property rights of our client, and secondly that this was not in actual fact the appropriate forum in any event that it lay within the Minsk process.</Text>

			<Text>It was only within that context that this new submission concerning free and unfettered access to Armenia arose, and we submit it is highly dissembling and artificial, given to the fact that actually for seven years no remedies were identified, and indeed no representation was made inviting the applicants to return to file claims.</Text>

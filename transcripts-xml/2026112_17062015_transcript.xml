			<TimestampBegin>264.1</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>In states governed by the rule of law, the role of the president of the Supreme Court and that of the persons in charge of court administration consists in performing their specialized professional everyday duties.</Text>

			<TimestampEnd>300.82</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Indeed, such an exceptional situation arose in 2011 in Hungary, when the applicant felt obliged to speak up on account of four issues vitally affecting the judicial system.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>300.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>307.14</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Firstly, he called into question the bill of the so-called Nullification Act.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>307.14</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>314.78</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This act ordered reopening final judgments delivered in relation to crowd dispersion in autumn 2006.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>314.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>330.06</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant criticized the manner in which the goal of the act would be achieved, namely reopening final judgments, denying free assessment of evidence, and annulling judicial decisions by the force of law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>330.06</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>333.66</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This legislation also set an alarming precedent.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>333.66</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>344.7</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>If a political force orders reopening a group of already closed cases that it dislikes, other political forces could do the same with other final judgments.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>344.7</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>354.82</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In response to these concerns, he got hostile reaction from the side of the ruling forces, denying that final judgments would be bind the legislator.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>354.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>367.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This court hardly needs to be reminded of the principles of separation of powers and of legal certainty, which involve that even the legislator shall be bound by final judgments.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>367.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>384.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The second issue which provoked shock and protest was the drastic reduction of the retirement age of judges by eight years that resulted in the forced and immediate retirement of 1 10th of the judiciary, affecting mainly senior high court and Supreme Court judges.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>384.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>392.54</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>392.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>397.34</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>397.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>410.3</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The plenary session of the Supreme Court, the National Judicial Council, as well as the presidents of regional and county courts addressed the communique to the Hungarian and European Union public.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>410.3</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>418.14</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>432.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As I mentioned, the applicant wrote an official letter to the prime minister, too, urging him to use his influence and to make every possible effort to prevent parliament from adopting the proposal.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>432.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>443.02</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>460.9</TimestampBegin>

			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>497.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>512.74</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>For these reasons, the applicant, as chief justice, decided for the first time in the Hungarian legal history to turn to the constitutional court, which eventually established the unconstitutionality of the impugned provisions and therefore quashed them.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>512.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>530.9</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is noteworthy that as a response to this decision, the disavowed provisions concerning the chief prosecutor's right to establish extra court competence was nevertheless reenacted in the new constitution, thereby immunizing it from further constitutional examination.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>530.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>537.26</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Lastly, the applicant spoke up in the parliamentary debate on the new cardinal acts on the judiciary.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>537.26</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>545.62</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>545.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>554.86</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>554.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>574.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In his speech, the applicant criticized mostly the fact that the collective decision-making power of the National Judicial Council was conferred to a single politically appointed chief executive of the court administration, who got excessive and in Europe unprecedented powers without any accountability.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>579.3</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>594.5</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We invite the court to bear in mind that the applicant, being the head of the judiciary, was under an explicit statutory obligation to express opinion on parliamentary draft legislations affecting the judiciary.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>594.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>602.34</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The concerns he raised were not his isolated ideas, but reflected the previously surveyed standpoint of the members of the judiciary.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>602.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>611.9</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The legal issues at stake were of high importance, as they affected fundamental matters, principally the basic institutions and judicial independence.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>611.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>637.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>They were so relevant that even the organs of the Council of Europe, like the monitoring committee of the Parliamentary Assembly and the Venice Commission, and European Ombudsman, the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Human Rights Watch, Chief Justices of the European Union, and different organizations of judges and lawyers from other countries, or even foreign governments, expressed their concern and disagreement.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>637.62</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>644.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>652.86</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>What is more, the European Court of Justice also condemned Hungary on account of the forced early retirement of judges.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>652.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>660.9</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As a consequence of the harsh international criticism and pressure, the Hungarian government had to change the relevant legislation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>671.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>682.34</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The removal was carried out despite the government having consistently denied that the new laws on judiciary would entail the termination of the applicant's term of office.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>682.34</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampEnd>715.18</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the face of all that, the applicant was not only removed, which necessarily involved the loss of his actual entitlements, but nine days later, by a personalized legislative provision, he has also been fully deprived of all his post-term presidential benefits, including presidential pension, which would have been due to him automatically after termination of office.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>778.42</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>473.11</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>This activity in the United Kingdom is authorized by a small number of general warrants, which are authorized only by a politician, not by a judge.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>482.75</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>489.95</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In 2016, only 13 warrants were issued under section 8.4 of RIPA.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>489.95</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>506.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Those warrants do not list the bearers, which are the entire communications links to be intercepted, nor do they list the strong selectors, the names and email addresses, for example, which are used to search through the bulk data.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>506.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>518.79</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>518.79</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>GCHQ, the UK agency that carries out bulk interceptions, has a practice of keeping all of the communications data that comes into their building for up to two years.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>539.19</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>560.59</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>567.51</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There is no system of independent prior approval before access to data is granted.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>567.51</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>577.07</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>What the government says about that is that access to data can only be granted in respect of data that appears on an index.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>577.07</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>587.23</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But analysts may choose to add a selector, add a person's communications to the index, simply by adding that appropriate selector.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>587.23</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>597.23</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it's worth comparing that with the scheme that this court considered in Liberty in the United Kingdom under the 1985 bulk interception legislation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>597.23</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>608.07</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>At paragraph 50 of the court's decision in that case, the court explained that a single official at GCHQ could not choose and add a selector for themselves.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>608.07</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>611.63</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>611.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>620.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Now, the government relies on four major safeguards in order to justify the convention compatibility of these arrangements.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>620.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>626.79</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The first is that warrants are targeted at external communications.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>626.79</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>635.83</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicants say that that safeguard has now lost any protective power as technology has developed.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>635.83</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>643.79</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The second safeguard that's relied on is the British Island safeguard, so-called, in section 16 of RIPA.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>643.79</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>651.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But that safeguard does not apply at all to communications data, as the first section found.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>651.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>658.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thirdly, the possibility of review ex post by the commissioner is relied on.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>658.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>664.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But these cases, as I'll seek to explain, have shown the limits of that in practice.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>664.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>673.15</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>673.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>682.47</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But if a person does not know that they are likely to have been a victim, the reality is that they will not go to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>682.47</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>696.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government's case ultimately comes down to trust us, trust us in the context of very large databases of private material, most of which is about people of no legitimate intelligence interest.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>696.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>715.19</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Trust us, even though the reality is that large and secretive institutions will often, in practice, consider that things that they want to do and things that they can do are also things that it is necessary and proportionate for them to do.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>715.19</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>733.39</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant's case is that trust alone is not enough to support a scheme which we say is lacking essential safeguards and permits interception and analysis of bulk data on a scale that we think is unprecedented in any democratic society.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>733.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>737.11</TimestampEnd>

			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>762.59</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>The safeguards upon which the court has insisted in the different cases in this context that have come before it are in nature minimum safeguards.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3581.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3610.02</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Secondly, those standards are themselves set or described as in effect principles, allowing different states to conform to them in different ways, recognizing the different systems that can exist compatibly with the convention and recognizing also that it is for contracting states ultimately to decide what is needed to protect its citizens and precisely how to ensure that the minimum standards are met.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3610.02</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3622.98</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3637.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3658.78</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And all of those features are important here because if the applicant's case on interception and intelligence sharing is accepted, and I mean their case both on whether the powers can exist at all and also their case on safeguards, it would be profoundly damaging for the capabilities and work of the intelligence services.</Text>

			<Text>The second question related to that is, and it also relates to the question posed by my colleague, Judge De Gaetano, is, if I recall rightly, in that judgment, the tribunal was confronted with the question of whether applicants who were located outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United Kingdom were in fact within its jurisdiction for the purposes of its Human Rights Act jurisdiction.</Text>

			<Text>But as we're in the Grand Chamber and we're invited to consider the scheme afresh, I wonder whether both parties could reflect on the question whether, in fact, our approach in the Bletchley judgment, where we said that the scope of the court's jurisdiction is determined by the convention and not by the party's submissions in a particular case, and the mere absence of a plea of incompatibility cannot extend jurisdiction, whether that means that, in fact, there is an issue here about jurisdiction which the court should concern itself with, whether, one, by way of admissibility, or two, and this reflects the question of my colleague, Judge De Gaetano, whether, in fact, the focus of our analysis needs to be in relation to those who are within the jurisdiction, and external communication insofar as it concerns those who are outside the jurisdiction is not within the scope of the case before us.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6440.94</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>And the third question, again, equally going to principle, is, of course, our case law so far has largely focused on the question of this issue, interception in the context of the right to respect for private life under Article 8, but, of course, a large number of the applicants are, in fact, corporate bodies, and I don't mean corporate in the commercial sense, but corporate in the non-natural person sense, and I would therefore ask both parties to reflect on the question whether, in fact, those applicants can have a right to respect for private life, and if they cannot, whether this falls, for example, under the heading of correspondence, and if so, whether the same tests apply.</Text>

			<Text>And the principal tool which he has at his disposal is the requirement to report to the Prime Minister, and those reports, as you've seen from the bundle, there are a series of reports that are published, and the Commissioner will have to decide whether to make a report to the Prime Minister to draw this error to his attention in a report, and then he will have to decide, as he has done year on year when this regime has been operating, then he will have to decide whether, and if so, to what extent it's possible to publish that error.</Text>

			<Text>The third of his questions, which was focused on the ECHR requirements and whether the bulk surveillance was in truth any really different from targeted surveillance, and that I think was also the subject, or close to the subject, of Judge Pinto de Albuquerque's first question, so if I can take them together.</Text>

			<Text>You are, to go back to the description in the Intelligence and Security Committee's 2015 report, you are using the bulk surveillance or the bulk data regime in order to try to identify threats so as to enable you better to target those who genuinely pose a threat, but they're doing fundamentally different, both thoroughly important, but fundamentally different things, and the safeguards are tailored accordingly.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>9603.87</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>Our answer to that, yes, he is appointed by the Prime Minister, but the relevant legislation, that is RIPA, in section 57, sub 5, requires in terms that the person who is appointed should be, or should have been, a member of the independent senior judiciary.</Text>

			<Text>It might be thought that the prime safeguard in having a Commissioner there is that he can go in at any stage to any of the agencies and say, right, show me that, show me the justification for doing that particular randomly selected interrogation of the system or search, or why did you produce that particular selector.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9838.35</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>The answer to that is, first, it might be caught because bulk interception is bulk interception, so one would not know whether it had been picked up as part of the interception of a particular bearer.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9852.11</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampEnd>9913.75</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And the bull point at both of those latter two stages is that that sort of message would not on any view fall within terrorism or serious crime or economic well-being of the United Kingdom related to national security, and it simply would not meet the conditions that are specified in the primary legislation.</Text>

			<Text>Honorable Court, the government of Ukraine would like to present their comments as to additional questions put by the Court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>195.93</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>208.73</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As to the first two questions, the government would like to know that all necessary factual information with relevant documents was submitted by the government in the course of the previous stages of the proceedings before the Court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>208.73</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>213.01</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Summarizing those facts, we would like to note the following.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>213.01</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>230.77</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>During the period when the applicant was held in Kiev CISO, all her complaints about the identity of medical treatment were mainly connected with the alleged appearance of red spots on her skin and low back pain, which appeared for the first time on 5 October 2011.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>230.77</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>241.69</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>With reference to those complaints, we would like to reiterate that during the aforementioned period, the applicant was receiving medical treatment which was adequate to her state of health.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>241.69</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>252.97</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>At the same time, it should be emphasized that the success of treatment provided to the applicant was prejudiced by her permanent refusal from any examination.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>252.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>265.85</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant and German doctors in their turn explained the aforementioned refusal by mistrust between applicant and state authorities, including doctors of state-run hospitals.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>265.85</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>274.93</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant alleged that such a situation developed as a result of continuous ineffective treatment during the first months of her detention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>274.93</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>284.45</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this regard, we would like to draw the Court's attention to the fact that the applicant refused from any examination from the first day of her detention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>284.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>296.13</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Hence, it was not the treatment provided to the applicant that caused aforementioned mistrust, but the applicant's position from the very beginning of her detention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>296.13</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>306.97</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Besides, the applicant was permanently consulted by her person, nurse, and doctor, who could monitor the process of providing the applicant with medical treatment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>306.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>313.85</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We therefore consider that the aforementioned mistrust was artificial and groundless.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>313.85</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>321.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>With reference to the applicant's refusal from medical treatment, the Government also would like to comment on each and every complaint.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>321.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>330.29</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thus, on 16 August 2011, the applicant complained for the first time about appearance of red spots on her body.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>330.29</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>344.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this regard, the Government noted that such hemorrhages clearly indicated that the possible disease was connected with blood and required conduction of biochemical blood analysis.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>344.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>348.61</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Such was the decision of doctors who examined the applicant.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>348.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>355.09</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Due to this, she was afforded to undergo such blood analysis, but she refused.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>355.09</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>361.53</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>She refused from conducting this examination in an independent civil hospital as well.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>361.53</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>370.91</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Instead of this, she just allowed to determine the time of blood clotting on condition for further destruction of biological material.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>370.91</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>386.49</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>At the same time, it should be emphasized that without a preliminary analysis, it was also impossible for a physician to put the right diagnosis or, if necessary, to forward the applicant to another specialist.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>386.49</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>391.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The same applies as to the applicant's initial complaints about low back pain.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>391.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>398.73</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Those complaints appeared for the first time on 5 October 2011.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>398.73</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>403.05</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>From the very beginning, the applicant was examined by a neurologist.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>403.05</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>409.57</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Necessary medicine was prescribed, and until the end of October 2011, her state of health improved.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>409.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>415.49</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Subsequently, the applicant refused from prescribed medicine and recommended examination.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>415.49</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>427.61</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As a result, low back pain intensified, and the applicant was prescribed additional medicine and recommended to undergo necessary instrumental examination.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>427.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>434.93</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant had been refusing from most of them until the second part of November, when she finally gave her consent.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>434.93</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>442.73</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As a result, the diagnosis was specified, and several new drugs corresponding to her state of health were prescribed.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>442.73</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>450.85</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We would also like to remind that the diagnosis put to the applicant at that time was subsequently confirmed by German doctors.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>450.85</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>459.77</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This fact was among other things mentioned in government's letter of 20 March 2012, and documents attached there, too.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>459.77</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>478.39</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, we would like to emphasize one more time that in spite of the applicant's continuous refusal from some examination and prescribed medicine, she received medical treatment to which she gave consent, and which could be prescribed on account of conducted examination.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>478.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>485.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Further, we would like to address course questions concerning condition of the applicant's detention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>485.37</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>508.77</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>First of all, we consider that the applicant's complaints concerning electric light being permanently switched on in cell 242, as well as all applicant's complaints concerning material condition in cell 300, should not be considered by the court, as they were submitted out of six time limits prescribed by the court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>508.77</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>515.81</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Those complaints clearly concerned applicant's detention before 29 November 2011.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>515.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>522.45</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>That is the date when the applicant was transferred to the cell number 260 in the medical unit.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>522.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>526.05</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The condition of detention was totally different.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>526.05</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>538.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Such transfer to the different type of detention regime, according to the court's well-established case law, put an end to alleged continuous violation of the above applicant's rights.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>538.37</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>546.49</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, the applicant should have lodged the aforementioned complaint not later than on 29 May 2012.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>546.49</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>552.13</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>552.13</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampEnd>577.41</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As to alleged lack of bedding, we would like to note that according to certificate submitted by the government, the remaining stock of new bedding in the CISO included several thousand items of bed lining above the number necessary to provide all detainees.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>577.41</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>586.29</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Instead of this, applicant used just her own bedding, which included 278 items of bed lining.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>586.29</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>595.53</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>699.65</TimestampBegin>

			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>791.33</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>809.01</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thus, as reason for the detention and extension of term of detention, National Courts noted that the applicant might attempt to abscond from trial, avoid the execution of procedural decision, and obstruct the establishment of truth in criminal case.</Text>

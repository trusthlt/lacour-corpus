			<TimestampBegin>307.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>326.17</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>If the restrictions of fundamental rights guaranteed by the convention, motivated by an ulterior purpose, not prescribed by the convention, are accepted, the result will cause profound damage to human rights, democracy, and rule of law in any democratic society.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>422.25</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>435.17</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>443.69</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As an initial matter, the applicant submits that his administrative arrests and detentions were unjustified and carried out under a pretext.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>443.69</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>453.17</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant was charged with disobeying a lawful order of a police officer and breaching established procedure for the conduct of demonstrations.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>453.17</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>465.73</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>465.73</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>471.45</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampEnd>479.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Rather, he participated in solo picketing, spontaneous assemblies, and walkouts.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>479.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>491.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Moreover, the authorities had ample opportunity, but unjustifiably failed to draw up administrative offense reports at the place of the applicant's apprehension.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>491.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>512.21</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As to the government's statement that it was not possible to draw up reports on the spot due to the risk that other protesters could obstruct the process, the applicant submits that, first, the police vehicles were in such a distance that it would hardly make it possible to obstruct the work of the police officers.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>512.21</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>518.27</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Further, there were enough police forces not to permit such an obstruction.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>518.27</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>537.81</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant also brings to the court's attention that in almost all episodes where an administrative arrest was affected against the applicant, he was released from police stations either when three-hour time limit was to be expired or after the end of that time limit.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>537.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>548.69</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>548.69</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>566.09</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant also claims that the actual circumstances of the applicant's arrest and detention are completely at odds with the stated official justifications, and he exposes these justifications as nothing more than bad faith pretext.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>566.09</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>569.73</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>583.57</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>and administrative convictions of the applicant also infringed on his freedom of peaceful assembly, which this court has time and again declared to be an essential foundation of a democratic society.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>583.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>598.69</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Russian Federation's endeavor to justify these infringements as supposedly prescribed by law, undertaken for legitimate aims and necessary in democratic society, is completely unsupported.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>598.69</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>607.29</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>First, the infringements were not based on law because the offenses with which he was charged did not, in fact, take place.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>607.29</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>616.45</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Second, the interference was neither proportional to any legitimate aim pursued, nor necessary in a democratic society.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>616.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>632.61</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government's assertion that interference with the applicant's freedom of assembly was necessary for the prevention of disorder or crime, and for the protection of rights and others, it is not supported by a shred of evidence.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>632.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>650.61</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is well settled by this court that breaking up a peaceful assembly solely because of the absence of the requisite prior authorization without any legal conduct by the participants amounts to a disproportionate restriction of the freedom of peaceful assembly.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>650.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>662.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thus, the applicant's treatment is part and parcel of the unfortunate pattern of hostility by the Russian authorities to the exercise of freedom of assembly in Russia.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>662.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>679.93</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>688.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>703.53</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As a preliminary matter, there is no merit to the government's position that Article VI of the government does not apply because the applicant was subjected to administrative arrests and detentions, which are not criminal under Russian law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>703.53</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>719.57</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The court has conclusively held that regardless to the domestic law classifications, administrative arrests, convictions, and fines, such as those imposed on the applicant, fall under the criminal limb of Article VI.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>719.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>727.29</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Further, the applicant submits that in all sets of proceedings, the national court violated key elements of fair trial.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>727.29</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>744.01</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Most notably, they based their judgments exclusively on their versions of events put forward by the police without any corroboration and refused to admit the applicant's profference of additional evidence and witnesses for the defense.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>744.01</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>759.41</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant, as we set out in detail in our written submissions, claims that his rights to personal liberty and freedom of assembly have been infringed because his political opinions are contrary to those of the ruling party.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>759.41</TimestampBegin>

			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>766.69</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>787.77</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>A telling illustration of the applicant's discriminatory treatment of demonstrators is that the 6th May 2012 large-scale unauthorized but pro-government demonstration in the center of Moscow was allowed to take place without any arrest, dispersal, or other interference.</Text>

			<Text>It is this. By relying on the domestic law on assemblies and by implication of the court's case law in the context of Article 11, which accepts in principle that the imposition of prior notification may be justified, the authorities in that case were said to seek to create a prior restraint on the freedom of expression, which is incompatible with the free communication of ideas and might undermine freedom of expression.</Text>

			<Text>The question for the government is this. Would you accept that reliance on the law of assemblies to justify the applicant's arrest, at least in relation to the two incidents identified, amount or might amount to an improper classification by the domestic authorities and or the courts, and or is capable of providing evidence relevant to the assessment of the applicant's complaint of bad faith or ulterior motives, which is currently pleaded under Article 18?</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>5688.89</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5702.69</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5737.81</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And now going to the Judge Ike question about Article 17, and we believe, and as I understand, it's also the applicant's opinion on that, that it requires comprehensive analysis, and we believe that this court shouldn't expand the subject on the case by adding additional articles since we don't see any additional Article 18 to Articles 5, 6, or 11 in this case as we put that in the numerous written submissions of the government.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5737.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5750.69</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5750.69</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5756.93</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5763.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5787.85</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Regarding the question about the effective remedies to be exhausted in Russia, we as a government provided extensive examples of these remedies to the court and the text of the court acts of Russian courts where applicants really rose these issues before the Russian courts in three cases and where it was considered by Russian court.</Text>

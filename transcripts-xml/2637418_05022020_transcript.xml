			<TimestampBegin>306.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>312.68</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I address the Court on behalf of my client, Gudmundur Andri Aastraarsson.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>312.68</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>331.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The central issue at stake in this case is the continued meaningful protection of probably the most important principle within Article 6 of the Convention, the right to a tribunal established by law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>331.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>344.28</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Without a real protection of this principle, the applicant contends that the rest of the rights of Article 6, paragraph 1, would be terminally undermined.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>344.28</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>360.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant maintains that the way to guard this principle and ensure its continued relevance is to confirm the well-reasoned and correct chamber judgment and find for the applicant in this case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>360.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>369.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>On the other hand, to overturn the chamber judgment would seriously damage the protection of this principle.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>369.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>377.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This is the core of the applicant's arguments in this case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>377.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>386.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Before proceeding further, I will seek to provide answers to the three questions put forth by the Court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>386.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>389.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The answer to the first question is this.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>389.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>405.72</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>According to the temporary provision to the Act on the Judiciary, it is clear that the Minister would only be required to submit new proposals to replace the refused candidates.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>405.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>412.56</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The second question is first and foremost for the government to answer.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>412.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>435.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, the applicant is of the opinion that this list or a group of 24 candidates for the judicial posts in the Court of Appeal does not exist and never existed, and therefore this matter has no significance for this case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>435.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>441.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Regarding the third question, the applicant answers as follows.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>441.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>455.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Icelandic law on criminal procedure provides the Supreme Court with an authority to reopen a case if an earlier process was sustainably flawed.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>455.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>464.88</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This criteria is general in nature, and its application depends on the facts of each case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>464.88</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>475.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Here, we have a situation where a judge has been appointed by a flagrant violation of law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>475.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>483.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>On the face of it, such fundamental flaw seems to merit reopening.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>483.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>491.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the Supreme Court's case law, however, there is no judgment that deals with similar situation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>491.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>506.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There is only a recent judgment concerning a different set of facts indicating that the Supreme Court will interpret the substantially flawed criteria restrictively.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>506.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>513.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, the question on the right to file for a reopening has no clear answer at this stage.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>517.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>524.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I will now turn to the background to the facts of the present case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>524.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>535.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There is, regrettably, a long-standing tendency in Iceland of political meddling in the appointment of judges.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>535.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>544.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In 2003 and 2004, the Minister of Justice appointed two judges to the Supreme Court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>544.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>555.24</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>555.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>568.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In 2007, the Minister of Justice appointed a district court judge in direct opposition with the proposal of an evaluation committee.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>568.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>583.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In all these instances, the appointments were clearly political in nature because the appointees were closely connected to the Independence Party.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>583.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>591.28</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In 2010, comprehensive changes were made to the stipulations on the appointment of judges.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>591.28</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>605.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In broad terms, the changes meant that the power of appointment was effectively withdrawn from the Minister of Justice and put in the hands of an evaluation committee.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>605.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>614.68</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The purpose of this was clear, to stop political corruption and the abuse of power in the appointment of judges.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>619.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>642.32</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There is no doubt that these changes can be directly traced to the harsh criticism and public outcry that resulted from the repeated political appointments of judges in 2003, 2004, and 2007.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>642.32</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>A few years after this, in 2016, a new act on the judiciary was enacted.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>650.38</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>660.4</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>One of its main purpose was to limit further the influence of the executive branch on judicial appointments.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>660.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>671.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It was also meant to ensure a proper and professional mechanism for the evaluation of judicial candidates.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>671.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>681.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>These changes in 2010 and 2016 aimed to rule out that a minister's whim could decide a judicial appointment.</Text>

			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>686.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>694.32</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The new act on the judiciary from 2016 also contained a special provision.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>694.32</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>709.68</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the event of the Minister of Justice decided to go against the proposals of the evaluation committee, the decision would need the consent of Parliament.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>709.68</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>731.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There is no doubt that the enactment of this special rule was meant to be a further safeguard against possible overstepping or abuse by the executive branch, and therefore to uphold and maintain public trust in a judiciary independent from the executive branch.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>861.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>874.38</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In May 2018, the Supreme Court ruled on the applicant's appeal and rejected the applicant's claim to quash the judgment of the Court of Appeal and order a retrial.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>874.38</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>There is case law, as the court will know, particularly emanating originally from Turkey, which showed that where there was a finding of a violation of the impartiality requirement, because, for example, of the presence of a military judge on courts trying conventional criminal proceedings involving the PKK and others, where there was that problem of objective partiality, then the court has stated, in principle, that would justify a reopening of the case.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>7060.99</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7076.11</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Well, the logic and criteria was as explained in our written submissions, paragraph 18, as evidenced from the documents, in particular document 63, 43, and document F, as well as documents 24 and the others that we've referred to.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>7085.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7102.43</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Now on the back of that, Judge Kouris asked a question specifically about how it was that a male judge, Judge 30, had been appointed in preference or above a female judge, I think it was Judge 22, given the gender balance point.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7102.43</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7116.55</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Well, as documents 43 and document F show, Judge 30 scored significantly higher than Judge 22 in terms of judicial experience, even on the evaluation committee's analysis.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>7116.55</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>7202.43</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7250.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7265.91</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And that leaves finally, I think, Judge Turkovich's question, what would be the consequence of annulment at the domestic level and what implications, if any, would the statute of limitations have?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7265.91</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7285.27</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Now, so far as that's concerned, the potential for reopening cases and the major problem in terms of legal certainty that that illustrates is not a potential that is met by any implication of statute of limitations.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>7285.27</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7303.15</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7303.15</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7318.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7338.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And as I said in my submissions earlier, they would allow any applicant, anywhere in the Council of Europe, to identify any defect in an appointment process and bring a challenge, even in the most extreme case, where the evidence was crystal clear, where they pleaded guilty, where years had gone by.</Text>
		</Snippet>

			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7338.67</TimestampBegin>

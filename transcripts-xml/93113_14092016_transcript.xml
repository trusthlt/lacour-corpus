			<Text>I would like to pose one question to the representative of the applicants.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>3719.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3725.86</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>3725.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3746.25</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In your written and also oral submissions, one of your key arguments is that the Data Protection Act was not meant at all to restrict any publishing activities concerning personal data.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3746.25</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3747.57</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And my question is this.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3747.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3781.53</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the Data Protection Act, as well as in the EU directive on which the act is based, as well as in the new general data protection regulation that has been adopted earlier this year in the EU, in all of these legislative instruments, it is expressly provided that the processing of personal data does cover, among other things, the disclosure by transmission, the dissemination, and other making available of personal data.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3781.53</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3804.38</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So in light of these express provisions, I would ask the applicants' representative to explain to the court on what basis you maintain that the data protection legislation is not intended at all to restrict any publishing of personal data.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3804.38</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3836.73</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And secondly, it would also be interesting to hear your views on the implications for data protection if data protection cannot cover the dissemination of personal data at all, or if it cannot in any way extend to the dissemination of personal data in case the disseminator declares that he is a journalist.</Text>

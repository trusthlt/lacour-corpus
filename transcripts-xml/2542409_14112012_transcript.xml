			<TimestampBegin>288.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>309.68</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But neither the European Convention on Human Rights nor the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires payment of compensation in these circumstances, nor does the presumption of innocence prevent any inquiry into the underlying facts to decide whether compensation is due.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>338.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>349.52</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>349.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>354.2</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>354.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>365.92</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>365.92</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>374.76</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>386.6</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>386.6</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4265.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4288.1</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4288.1</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4297.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4322.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And another example is where statistical scientific evidence relied upon at the time of prosecution has become so discredited that it is no longer reliable at all, such that the evidence against the defendant is undermined to the extent that no prosecution could then take place.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4322.54</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4332.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4345.54</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4345.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4360.9</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4360.9</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4397.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4410.02</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>4713.15</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>4748.03</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4754.59</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4771.95</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

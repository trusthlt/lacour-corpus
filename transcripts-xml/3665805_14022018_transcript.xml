			<Text>The applicant was not able to question a key witness, police officer Said Akhmaev, who, as the facts of this case suggest, played a central role in the undercover police operation against the applicant, which eventually resulted in the applicant's arrest and alleged installation of explosive devices in her bag following the arrest.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>482.38</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>500.77</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>512.67</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>531.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>547.58</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The standard of overall fairness requires that, in such cases, the defense is provided with counterbalancing measures to compensate for its handicaps, regardless of whether the statement of the absent witness is sole or decisive evidence.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>547.58</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>This was initially set out as a step-by-step test in Al-Khawaja and Tahrir against the United Kingdom and redefined in Shachashvili against Germany as factors to be taken into account when assessing the overall fairness of proceedings.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>566.88</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>586.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Importantly, in an attempt to abandon the sole or decisive test in Al-Khawaja and Tahrir, the Grand Chamber reasoned that its inflexible application would run counter to the Court's ability to examine the fairness of proceedings as a whole.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>592.77</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>613.17</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Under the criteria set out in Perna against Italy and summarized in paragraph 84 of the Chamber Judgment, in this case, the Court shall consider, first, whether the defense request to call a witness was sufficiently reasoned and relevant to the subject matter of the accusation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>613.17</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>622.78</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The threshold is that the witness statement can arguably strengthen the defense position or even lead to the applicant's acquittal.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>622.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>636.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The second question would then be whether the trial court, by not securing attendance of a certain witness to testify on behalf of the defendant, breached his or her rights under Article VI.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>636.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>652.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, as the cases that followed Perna show, it is for the applicant to prove that the defense witness was of such importance as to warrant an acquittal in the case against him or her.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>652.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>668.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thus, in Popov against Russia and Poliakov against Russia, the Court found violations of Article VI on account of the domestic court's failure to secure the attendance of alibi witnesses.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>668.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>683.88</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In Guillory against France, the same failure concerned a witness who was able to testify about the defendant's recourse to violence, a constituent element of the offense in that case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>683.88</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>698.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Likewise, overturning acquittal on appeal and entering a conviction without rehearing witnesses was held to violate Article VI in Deterrem against France and Vidal against Belgium.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>698.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>709.38</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, where the witnesses were not testifying to alibi or to a constituent element of the offense, no violation of Article VI was established.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>709.38</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>715.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This happened in Perna and in Dorokhov against Russia.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>715.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>727.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This approach amounts to maintaining the robust application of the sole or decisive evidence test for defense witnesses, abundant for the prosecution witnesses.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>727.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>741.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Under Perna, the defendants have the right to call witnesses if they are to a sufficient extent aware of the nature and role that the witness statement is able to play in their cases.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>741.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>758.91</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, the obvious deficiency of the Perna approach is that it is silent on cases like the applicants, where the involvement of witnesses, such as undercover police agents, is unspecified or unknown to the defense prior to confrontation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>758.91</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>4226.34</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>I will firstly make some brief comments on the government submissions and then move to the judges' questions.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>4235.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4247.72</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Firstly, with regard to nature of witness Akhmayev as only a defense witness, the responding government submitted that persecution never relied on his evidence.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4247.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4258.26</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4258.26</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4267.26</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4267.26</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4273.58</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And finally, it was relied upon both by the trial and the appeal courts.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4273.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4290.74</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Secondly, the responding government said that it is the role of the defense, not the court, to ensure Akhmayev's presence for the reason that the court doesn't act for persecution or for defense.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4290.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4297.7</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4297.7</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4305.34</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And that is because Russian Code of Criminal Procedure provides for active role of the judge in the conduct of the trial.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4305.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4311.58</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4311.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4327.42</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And that includes powers to hold preliminary hearing, to refer case back to prosecutor, to amend the charges, to obtain forensic expert report, to put questions to witness, and importantly, to decide to read out the statement of an absent witness.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4327.42</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4337.06</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4337.06</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4352.1</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4352.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4360.6</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>4380.26</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4390.86</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4390.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4399.26</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Because the reasons for the request to call Mr. Akhmayev at the trial</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4402.14</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4413.7</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And that was because the motion was just after the applicant concluded, given her evidence, which set out Akhmayev's role in detail.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4413.7</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4428.98</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4428.98</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4439.42</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>4439.42</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4441.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4457.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I start with question of Judge Icke concerning the waiver argument, whether the applicant waived her rights by agreeing to reading out Mr. A's statement.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4457.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4458.52</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4458.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4462.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And this issue was raised by the chamber in the communication.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4462.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4467.66</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it was subsequently dismissed, and for a reason.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4467.66</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4482.12</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant only agreed to reading out the statement when she was informed, and her defense was informed, of the impossibility to question witness A in person.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4482.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4490.5</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So first, the judge says, well, it won't be possible to call A for questioning because he's on a duty mission.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4490.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4495.74</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4495.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4503.42</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So when agreeing to that, the applicant, as we said earlier today, had no other option available.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4503.42</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4508.74</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4511.14</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4517.62</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4517.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4524.02</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4524.02</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4539.52</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We indeed said that Article 281, paragraph 1, requires the judge to seek opinion concerning reading out the absent witness's statements.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4539.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4547.46</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So it requires first that the witness be properly summoned, and that attempts to bring him by force fail.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4547.46</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4551.38</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4551.38</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4559.54</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4559.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4567.94</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>

			<TimestampBegin>4649.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4663.86</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>4677.78</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4925.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4949.21</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And the clause two of the article, it is the special rule which says that there are circumstances, for example, the death of the witness or it's heart disease or whatever, when court can do that without consent of both parties, but upon the motion from one party or under the court's own initiative.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4949.21</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4953.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So that's the article 281.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4953.37</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4961.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And from the permission of court, I will now go to answering the honorable judge's questions.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>4961.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4968.33</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And first, questions from the Judge Vyhabovich about the custody on December 2003.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4968.33</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4979.49</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it is not relates to the maybe to the present proceeding since it was not article 5 consideration here, but under the witness statements.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4979.49</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4985.97</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it's a witness statement of what was the mother of one of the applicant's flatmates.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4985.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4987.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>She stayed there only for one day.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4987.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4990.97</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So it wasn't several days when she stayed there.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4990.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5001.17</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I would like to point the court's attention that this apprehension was never objected by the applicant in Russian court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5001.17</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5010.05</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And also, according to the letter to the Grand Chamber, the subject matter of the present proceeding concerns the issue of right of Mr. A.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5010.05</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5019.53</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Regarding the other videotapes, I would like to point out that all transcripts of all videotapes were in a case file.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5019.53</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5032.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But the prosecutors referred only to the video scribes from only one videotape, which was used as the prosecutor's evidences.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5032.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5042.85</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But all videotapes, scribes were in a case file and they are in a case file.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5042.85</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5065.97</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As regard to the question of witnesses, including the attesting witnesses which were not had, it is important to understand that also, according to the adversarial nature of Russian criminal procedure, it only that witnesses who are called by the defense or by the prosecutors aside could be had and would be had in the court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5065.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5077.01</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And since no defense, no prosecutors asked for the attesting witnesses to be had in the court, they were dismissed that they were not called to the court at all.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5077.01</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5089.41</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And in particular, they were not also asked on the investigation stage and pretrial stage because there was no objection or motion from the parties on that.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5089.41</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5104.01</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And therefore, also by failing to amend the list of witnesses on pretrial stage and by failing to ask the court to summon them attesting witnesses, the applicant has explicitly waived her right to question those witnesses.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5104.01</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5109.33</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And the court may not decide this issue on its own initiative.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5109.33</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5118.17</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And in any event, these attesting witnesses were not questioned in the pretrial stage, as I said, and no one from the party decided to do that.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5118.17</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5128.81</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And also, it was unreasonable to ask them since there was no objection from the applicant's part about the procedure of the search of her bag.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5128.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5145.01</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And as I also mentioned in my presentation, the policemen who really participated in that, all of them were examined in the court and asked the question who were present during the search of the bag.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5145.01</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5156.25</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Regarding Judge Arutyunyan's question, what possibilities could be used by the applicant and applicant lawyers, and I think I have listed them in my speech.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5156.25</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5159.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it is really plenty of possibilities for them.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5159.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5162.53</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>They could file new motions to summon Mr. A.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5162.53</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5165.09</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>They could request to postpone the hearing.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5165.09</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5168.77</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>They could challenge the information that he was on a mission.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5168.77</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5188.01</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I would remind the Honorable Court that it was the defense witness and the defense had an address and telephone of this witness and could ensure by themselves to put him to the court, as the defense did with other defense witnesses.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5188.01</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5201.21</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Regarding Judge Albuquerque's questions about the fingerprints, which were not taken, it is also hardly understandable which exactly resonated to this matter.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5201.21</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5208.97</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But the fingerprints were not taken since the applicant herself took her belongings from her bag during the search.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5208.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5212.45</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And that is why they were there.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5212.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5215.81</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There were clearly her fingerprints were on that things.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5215.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5226.17</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And the same situations appears, for example, in the airport when the passenger by himself put his belongings from the bag.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5226.17</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5236.57</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And also that is why there were no fingerprints uprooted in this case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5236.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5238.61</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>244.26</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>265.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>ladies and gentlemen, the six-month time limit set forth in Article 35, Paragraph 1 of the Convention serves to prevent the compatibility of a national decision, action, or omission with the Convention being questioned after a considerable lapse of time by the submission of an application to the court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>265.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>280.38</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It reflects the wish of the contracting parties to prevent past decisions being called into question after a long period of time, therefore serving the interest of legal certainty as a value in itself.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>280.38</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>307.5</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Recently, these principles were reaffirmed by the Brighton Declaration, where the conference reiterated the importance of the court applying fully, consistently, and foreseeably all the admissibility criteria, including the rules regarding the scope of the court jurisdiction, both to ensure the efficient application of justice and to safeguard the respective roles of the court and the national authorities.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>307.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>322.14</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Furthermore, the strict and consistent application of the admissibility criteria contributes to the strength of the Convention system by ensuring that unnecessary pressure is not placed on the court's workload.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>322.14</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>342.43</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government of Macedonia embraces the consistent and foreseeable approach taken by the court so far in applying the six-month rule to cases relating to acts or events violating Articles 2, 3, or 5, or 5 taken alone or in conjunction with Article 13 of the Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>342.43</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>362.82</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this respect, the court in a number of cases concerning ongoing investigations has examined the period of time from which the applicant can or should start adopting the effectiveness of a remedy and is bearing on the six-month limit provided for in Article 35, Paragraph 1 of the Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>362.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>384.23</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Determination of such a period by the court depends on the circumstances of each case and factors, such as the diligence and the interest displayed by the applicants in pursuing the avenues of redress and informing themselves about the progress made in the investigation, as well as the adequacy of the investigation in question.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>384.23</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>399.23</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>According to the well-established case law of this court, the diligence in this regard must be seen as demonstrated, active stance on the part of the applicants towards the investigation by perceiving the investigation as effective.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>399.23</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>417.11</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Taking into account the above-mentioned principles, the government respectfully submits that due to the applicant's lack of diligence, which consisted in his own negligence, the application in question has been introduced out of the court's temporal jurisdiction within the meaning of the six-month rule.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>417.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>426.26</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, the application in question should be declared as inadmissible under Article 35, Paragraph 1 of the Convention.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>426.26</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>441.87</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government invites the court to conclude that the applicant must have become aware of the ineffectiveness of the investigation long before he lodged the criminal complaint and more than six months before he lodged the application to the court.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>460.42</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>480.9</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government notes that since 2004 until the end of 2008, when the applicant filed a criminal complaint, the applicant remained totally passive and displayed no initiative in informing the law enforcement authorities in Macedonia that a crime had been committed against him.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>480.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>486.87</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>494.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>502.62</TimestampEnd>

			<Text>In December 2005, the applicant filed a civil claim in the US courts, alleging that he had been deprived of liberty in absence of legal process.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>512.99</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>520.55</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The claim was finally dismissed in October 2007 by a decision of the US Supreme Court not to review the case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>520.55</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>531.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>According to the applicant, the choice to initiate proceedings in the US instead of Macedonia was that he viewed the US government as the party primarily responsible for his unjust suffering.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>534.98</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>542.42</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant's allegations were also subject to several international inquiries during 2006 and 2007.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>542.42</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>549.22</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Those inquiries were conducted by the Council of Europe, the European Parliament, and were political in nature.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>555.66</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>566.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is worth noting, however, that according to this court, international inquiries as such cannot be regarded as part of the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>577.18</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>589.87</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>589.87</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>608.14</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Even if the applicant relied on the obligation on the part of the Macedonian authorities to investigate his allegations with their own motion, the ineffectiveness of this avenue must have become clear to the applicant long before 6th of October 2008, the date when he lodged the criminal complaint.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>608.14</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>615.87</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>628.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Second, due to the fact that the Macedonian public prosecutor did not instigate ex-officio investigation, despite information becoming available to him from his German counterpart.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>628.37</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>644.98</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>688.59</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4357.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4377.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>According to the already well-established case law, the manner in which the applicants' inquiries are responded by the authorities should be prerequisite in finding flagrant, continuous, and callous disregard for the applicants' concerns and anxieties amounting to inhuman treatment within the meaning of Article 3.</Text>

			<Text>With respect just to the admissibility questions, one just on the point that was just raised earlier about the purported delay and negligence of the applicant in bringing a formal complaint to the Macedonian authorities and the suggestion that the applicant was doing nothing in the interim, we would submit that in a case of this complexity, crimes of this nature in which more than one state is involved, and particularly given that the nature of the crimes themselves is secret and governments have gone to a great length to maintain their secrecy as to what happened and to deny and to stonewall the revelation of facts, in that context, four and a half years, we would submit, is not a long period of time for the applicant to assemble the necessary facts to provide to criminal investigation authorities in Macedonia.</Text>

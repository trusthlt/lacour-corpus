		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>296.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>307.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>ladies and gentlemen, it's a privilege and a pleasure to have the opportunity to appear before the Court to present the oral submissions on behalf of the Government of Hungary.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>307.04</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>During the written procedure before the Court, both parties, as well as the intervening third parties, have been given ample opportunity to put forward their arguments.</Text>
		</Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>318.38</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>329.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Hence, it is not necessary to repeat now the details of the position of the government outlined recently in their memorial of the 7th of September, 2015.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>329.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>335.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I will rather focus on the most important issues raised by the case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>335.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>356.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>First of all, let me reaffirm that the government considers that the right to defense, as well as the right of access to public information, are fundamental human rights to be guaranteed in a democratic society based on the rule of law, and both rights are clearly enshrined in the fundamental law of Hungary.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>356.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>370.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The present case, however, is not about the existence or significance of the right of access to official documents in general, but whether this right falls within the scope of Article 10 of the Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>370.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>375.52</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And if so, what are the limits of the jurisdiction of this Court?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>375.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>384.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The first issue to be considered is whether the right of access to information falls within the scope of Article 10 of the Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>384.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>389.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In other words, whether Article 10 is applicable to the present case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>389.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>408.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government are of the opinion that the right of access to information is an autonomous right aimed at enhancing transparency and good governance, and it is not simply a part of or auxiliary to the freedom of expression.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>408.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>421.38</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But even if it were considered as an inherent aspect of the freedom of expression, this aspect was deliberately excluded from the scope of Article 10 by its drafters.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>421.38</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>449.5</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Having regard to the wording of Article 10, contrasted with the wording of other international human rights instruments concerning freedom of expression, as well as the travel preparatoire of Article 10, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and the Court's longstanding jurisprudence in line with its judgment in the case of Leander versus Sweden, the government consider that Article 10 is not applicable to the present case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>449.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>457.74</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the present case, the applicant's freedom of expression within the meaning of Article 10 has not been interfered with.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>457.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>482.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant organization was not prevented from publishing its survey and express its opinion on an issue of public importance, and in contrast to the case of Daman versus Switzerland, the applicant was not sanctioned for receiving information which was given to it by the police in breach of the provisions of Hungarian law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>482.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>492.7</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this case, the applicant's complaint is clearly based on a claim for a right of access to information which doesn't fall within the scope of Article 10.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>492.7</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>514.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government are of the opinion that the court should not depart from its position in the case of Leander versus Sweden, namely that the right to freedom to receive information basically prohibits a government from restricting a person from receiving information that others wish or may be willing to impart to him.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>514.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>526.52</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It follows that Article 10 doesn't confer on the individual a justiciable right of access to information which is not intended to be imparted.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>526.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>537.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Admittedly, the court's judgment in the case of Társasága Szabadságjogokert versus Hungary has widely been interpreted as a departure from that position.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>537.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>552.78</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, the government emphasized that the court itself stated in paragraph 36 of the judgment that the case didn't concern the denial of a general right of access to official documents.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>552.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>587.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government realized that their concession concerning the applicability of Article 10 in that case, based exclusively on considerations of domestic law as in force at that time, proved to have unintended consequences on the development of the jurisprudence of the court, and agree with the British government that unilateral concession cannot serve as a basis for expansion of the Convention into areas which it was not intended to cover.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>587.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>599.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government are of the opinion that the living instrument approach invoked by the third parties would not justify the extension of the scope of Article 10 either.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>599.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>605.66</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The right of access to information is not a new aspect to freedom of expression.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>605.66</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>614.88</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It was not unknown to the legal systems of the member states of the Council of Europe at the time of drafting Article 10 of the Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>614.88</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>621.12</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Yet, it was deliberately omitted from the scope of this provision.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>621.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>630.68</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This aspect of the right was deliberately not subjected to the international control mechanism established by the Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>630.68</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>649.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Moreover, the member states of the Council of Europe, the high contracting parties to the Convention, confirmed that Article 10 did not cover the right of access to information when they adopted in 2009 the European Convention on access to official documents.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>649.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>655.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Official documents meaning any information drafted or received and held by public authorities.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>655.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>670.92</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The explanatory report of that Convention states that it is the first binding international legal instrument to recognize a general right of access to official documents held by public authorities.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>670.92</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>697.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Moreover, the government point out that the high contracting parties, as recently as 2009, still didn't intend to subject this right to the jurisdiction of the court and opted for the adoption of a separate treaty with distinct supervisory mechanism instead of adopting an additional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>697.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>717.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The fact that many of the high contracting parties provide for the right of access to information in the domestic law or adopted other international treaties ensuring the right to seek information does not justify that the same right be interpreted into Article 10 of the Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>717.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>725.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In spite of its wording and the intentions of its drafters, the member states of the Council of Europe.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>725.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>743.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>One of the reasons for the member states' reluctance to extend the court's jurisdiction to cover the right of access to information is the need to preserve the effective functioning of the court, which has already been facing an immense caseload for years.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>743.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>766.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The number of potential applications inviting the court to carry out a forced instance review of rejected requests for information, like in the present case, as well as the scale and complexity of the issues to be considered in each case are prohibitive in this respect.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>766.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>778.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, the government considers that the right to seek information is not ensured by Article 10, and the court should not extend the scope of Article 10 to cover this right.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>778.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>792.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thus, Article 10 is not applicable in the present case, and the application should be declared inadmissible, ratione materie, in accordance with Article 35, Paragraph 3A of the Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>792.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>804.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Should the court find that Article 10 is applicable in cases of denial of access to information, the next issue to be examined is the scope of jurisdiction of the court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>804.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>844.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government are of the opinion that the court only has jurisdiction to examine complaints of denial of access to information in cases where the lack of access to a particular piece of information effectively prevents the applicant for expressing, publishing an opinion on an issue of public importance, because there are no alternative means of obtaining that information, and the applicant is liable under civil or criminal law for the factual correctness or well-foundedness of his statements.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>844.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>852.66</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Only in these cases can be said that denial of access to information interferes with the freedom of expression.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>852.66</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>864.78</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The case of Kennedy versus Hungary would have been a close example under slightly different conditions had the applicant been really denied access to the requested information.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>864.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>876.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, the correct reading of the facts of that case is that the applicant was only prevented by the authorities from publishing information accessible to him.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>876.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>881.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Not having access at all was his own decision.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>881.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>889.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, this case cannot be regarded to have established the right of access to information under Article 10.</Text>
		</Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>889.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>905.28</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Should the court interpret the Kennedy judgment as an authority establishing that Article 10 may be engaged, that the state has failed to comply with an established domestic right of access to information?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>905.28</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>926.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government agreed with the opinion of the British government that the court should refrain from interpreting the domestic law itself, and should accept the interpretation given by the domestic court, which is in a better position to interpret the provisions of domestic law, and which is solely competent to do so.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>926.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>933.48</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>933.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>951.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>An exemption to this rule might only be made when, in a most extreme case, the domestic court's judgment is manifestly arbitrary, contrary to a clear and highly specific provision of domestic law, not leaving any room for judicial interpretation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>951.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>977.88</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Even if the court found that a domestic right of access to information gave rise to claims under Article 10, it should, under no circumstances, go beyond requiring enforcement of an established right, and examine whether access should have been granted to a particular type of information, as it is proposed by the applicant in the present case.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>977.88</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>1015.52</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Such an examination would imply the consideration of complex social, political, and legal issues, and the balancing of various interests which falls outside the competence of the court, and can best be carried out by the domestic authorities, most of all by the legislator, which enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in this field, having regard to the lack of consensus across the Council of Europe states, on the extent to which there should be access to state information.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>1015.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>1033.32</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Even the Council of Europe Convention access to official documents not yet in force could not provide sufficient guidance to the court, since it sets out only very general framework rules, deferring the detailed regulation to domestic law.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>1033.32</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>1052.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The scope of review by the court, as well as the corresponding margin of appreciation of the state, will also depend on whether the rights ensured by Article 10 are construed as entailing only negative or also positive obligations.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>1052.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>1079.92</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Any positive obligations under Article 10 have so far arisen as an obligation to protect from interference by private persons, and they should not be construed as an obligation to promote or fulfill by creating alternative venues for expression or providing subsidies, or even information which is not willingly imparted.</Text>

			<TimestampEnd>5436.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As to the second question, seeking information and its relation to other documents of international human rights protection, I have to admit, of course, that we did not find any other example where the seeking of documents was not incorporated in these international documents.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5436.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5451.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So both in the case of the Inter-American practice and in the case of the Human Rights Committee practice, their texts are actually containing the reference to seeking.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>5451.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5479.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>That's true, but I have to add, partly in connection with what has been said by the Hungarian government earlier, that in this situation, we cannot say that by the time those documents were drafted, there was actually a concept for the access to documents or the concept of freedom of information.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5479.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5490.74</TimestampEnd>

			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5490.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5522.14</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And one short answer to the question of Judge Kudis is that we also did not encounter any kind of consequences for disclosing those personal data in the case of the departments who actually answered the request of freedom of information.</Text>

			<Text>Second example of implications, the logic of the applicant's position is that each of these facets of a domestic right to freedom of information, if it exists, would be subject to some sort of proportionality reasoning and analysis by the court.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5671.06</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5697.5</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5697.5</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>5725.22</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5736.46</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5756.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I tell you from my own personal experience of freedom of information cases in the UK, where the question is whether a public body was justified, was entitled to withhold information, the court or tribunal which is examining that question must of course look at the information.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>

			<Text>And the complicating factor in the procedure of the court is that the applicant cannot be allowed to look at the information and to make those arguments on the basis of the information, because otherwise the litigation would be determined.</Text>

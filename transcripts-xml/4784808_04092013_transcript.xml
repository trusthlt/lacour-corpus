		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>441.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>464.71</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We are also well aware of the fact that the idea of the convention being a living instrument was applied not only to its substantive provisions, but more relevantly to its interpretation of former Article 25, the current Article 34, given the special character of the convention as a constitutional instrument of European public order for the protection of individual human beings.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>464.71</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>However, the government underlined that all these developments of the case law are and must be construed only in the context of the interpretation of the convention, which is the process of determining the meaning of a given text.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>497.35</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>510.35</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Moreover, we firmly uphold that this interpretation is not a restrictive and technical approach that would deny the very essence of the rights under assessment or the broader interest for the human rights protection.</Text>

			<TimestampEnd>550.19</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Given the applicant's written observation where it pleads for the recognition of a possibility for every non-governmental organization to petition the court in order to raise awareness on the potential violation of fundamental rights of third parties, the government consider that, in essence, the applicant pleads for the recognition of an actio popularis for the benefit of the non-governmental organization and, as a consequence, for the forsake of the victim concept.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>550.19</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>575.51</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Even if such a change in the approach of the victim concept were to be pursued by way of interpretation, it is to be emphasized that such a shift in the court's jurisprudence should not be the mere result of a reexamination of Article 34 in an isolated demarche, but one that is derived from the acknowledgment of the state parties' common understanding of the current content of the concept.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>575.51</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>590.23</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As the court has constantly held, an actio popularis was only accepted for the states in order to supervise each other under Article 33 and implies the waiver of the victim condition imposed by Article 34.</Text>

			<TimestampEnd>607.71</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>To leave aside the condition of claiming to be a victim for the third party means to put on equal footing the states and the non-governmental entities, which obviously benefit from a different treatment in terms of the right to individual recourse according to the intention and desire of the contracting parties.</Text>

			<Text>It is our government conclusion at this general and preliminary level that the interpretation of the convention, although evolving and extensive, could not be divorced from the contracting parties' intention and understandings of the conventional goals.</Text>

			<Text>It is useful to recall that during all three high-level conferences on the future of the European Court, the participating states reaffirmed their attachment to the right of individual application before the European Court.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>636.03</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>666.47</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The recurring use of the words attachment or reaffirmation of their commitment to the above-mentioned right clearly indicates that the 47 contracting parties still share 60 years after the entering into force of the convention the same understanding on the exercise of the individual petition only by an individual, non-governmental entity, or group of individuals that claim to be a victim, be it a direct victim, an indirect, or a potential one.</Text>

			<Text>Thus, in the case of Goray Zlizariga and others, when taking into account the particular circumstances of the case, especially the fact that the applicant association was set up for the specific purpose of defending its members' interests before the courts, and that those members were directly concerned by the dam project, the court considered that the applicant association, together with its members, could claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34.</Text>

			<Text>On the other hand, in the case of Fédération Chrétienne de Témoin de Gévaudan de France, the applicant, a national association representing Jehovah's Witnesses and complaining about a parliamentary report on sects, was considered not to be a victim, as it could not claim to have been directly affected by the measure in question.</Text>

			<Text>Thus, in the case of Adarossi, the court, although noting the important role played by the applicant associations in providing assistance to care for people in a vegetative state, considered that the impugned acts, namely the decision of the Milan Court of Justice, could not actually have any impact on their activities.</Text>

			<Text>Turning to the legal standing in terms of the conventional standards as developed by the court in its case law, we recall that the indirect victim is described as an individual who is not directly affected by a particular measure or omission, but who may nevertheless be affected by the violation of the conventional rights of another person.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>838.59</TimestampBegin>

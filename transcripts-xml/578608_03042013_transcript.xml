			<Text>Honorable European judges, and learned colleagues, this case is about a 14-year-old girl who was secretly filmed by her stepfather while undressing and taking a shower.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>298.11</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>305.23</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>314.03</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I think we all agree that the 14-year-old girl, or anyone else for that matter, should not have to be exposed to that kind of behavior.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>314.03</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>334.95</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We can also all agree that this once 14-year-old girl, who has now, after all the legal proceedings, turned 25, Elisa Söderman, sitting here today, did not receive any form of redress for this violation in the Swedish national system, even though she tried to.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>335.99</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>342.11</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And the applicant's position is that this failure is a result of a flaw in Swedish law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>342.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>356.35</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I would like to draw the court's attention to a case from the Swedish Supreme Court, case NJA 2008, page 946, concerning covert filming in that case of an adult.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>356.35</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>377.83</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Swedish Supreme Court stated the following, and I quote, it is highly questionable whether the fact that acts of filming of an individual in situations where such filming deeply violates the Swedish law and violates the personal integrity of the person concerned are left wholly unsanctioned under Swedish law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>377.83</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>382.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Is that compatible with the requirements of Article 8 of the European Convention?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>382.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>389.03</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>A fact that these acts are left wholly unsanctioned according to the Swedish Supreme Court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>389.03</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>398.71</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Swedish Supreme Court obviously found that there is such a flaw that we are talking about regarding covert filming and the Convention rights.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>398.71</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>410.11</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, the Swedish Supreme Court did not find reason to go further, and instead, practically speaking, dropped this issue into the lap of the legislator.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>410.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>430.91</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We have recently seen a late recognition from the Swedish government, that is not from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but from the Ministry of Justice, that there, in fact, is such a flaw in the law, and that this flaw must be taken care of.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<Text>This is the whole meaning with the Swedish government's new proposal for legislation on offensive photography, proposal 2012-13-169.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>444.11</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>460.47</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>467.15</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>467.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>477.59</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This potential new legislation might have an effect for other future victims under the condition that this proposal eventually will pass in the Swedish parliament.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>494.07</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>519.51</TimestampEnd>

			<Text>Your Honors, since the presentation must be short, I refer to our observations from February, and especially our late observations from March of this year.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>616.26</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>My colleague has already mentioned the opinion of the Swedish Supreme Court regarding the lack, the entire lack of sanctions for covert or illicit filming in Swedish law.</Text>
		</Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>629.14</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>My colleague also mentioned that the Swedish government has proposed new legislation on offensive photography.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>638.3</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>661.42</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>On page 10 of this proposal, the government noted that while some kinds of covert photography might be criminalized under various sections of the criminal code, jurisprudence had shown that in many cases, the courts had been unable to convict person for these offenses.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>661.42</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>686.22</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government has also pointed to the present case to demonstrate that in spite of the change of judgment, which found that Sweden had not violated Elisa Söderman's rights, that three of seven judges had found that Sweden had not fulfilled its positive obligations according to Article 8 of the convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>686.22</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>705.74</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The very fact that the Swedish government has now proposed this new provision in the criminal code, which criminalizes covert photography in intimate places, is a clear demonstration that there exists a flaw in Sweden's present legislation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>705.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>716.9</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>New criminal laws are not proposed if there isn't a real lack, a lacuna, a flaw in the existing law.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>716.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>736.42</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In its observations from February 15, 2013, to the grand chamber, the Swedish government continues to maintain what we just pointed out, that the present application does not reveal any significant flaw in the Swedish law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>736.42</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>762.86</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government repeats the chamber's statements, and I quote, that although there was no specific provision in Swedish law concerning covert or illicit filming, there was a legal framework in place which could at least in theory cover acts such as the one that the applicant's stepfather was prosecuted for.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>762.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>782.74</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>To demonstrate this claim, the government maintains that the stepfather was acquitted due to the lack of requisite evidence concerning certain aspects of his intent, and not due to the lack of applicable criminal provisions.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>782.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>791.02</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In our opinion, this is not a question of evidence, but rather a matter of the construction of the law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>791.02</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>805.74</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It was and is possible to construe a criminal provision which criminalizes covert photography or filming as such, whether or not the victim becomes aware of it while it's taking place.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>805.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>815.9</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>To construe such a crime is in fact exactly what the government is doing in its new proposal to the Swedish parliament.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>815.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>846.86</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The construction of the crime of sexual or other molestation with the requirement that the perpetrator must have the intention to let the victim become aware of the act at the moment it's carried out may certainly be criticized, since such punishable acts, as in the present case, are otherwise not covered by any other criminal provisions.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>846.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>860.78</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Obviously, it lies in the nature of covert filming that the perpetrator doesn't intend for the victim to discover that she or he is being filmed.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>860.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>880.82</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thus, if the perpetrator has no intent that the victim, as in the present case, should discover that he was filmed and intended to use the film for his own purposes, it's meaningless, completely meaningless, to discuss in terms of establishing intent.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>880.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>898.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In reality, the government's claim that it was only a lack of evidence which was the problem and the reason that the stepfather was acquitted is simply an attempt to hide the flaw in the law, which Elisa's case has demonstrated.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>898.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>909.22</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It should be emphasized that what has been said concerning sexual molestation is equally relevant concerning the crime molestation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>909.22</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>935.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government itself, in its proposal for new legislation on offensive photography, stated the following, and I quote, a certain protection against offensive photography is stipulated in the provision concerning molestation in chapter 4, section 7 of the penal code, which protects individuals against different forms of ruthless behavior.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>935.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>952.5</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In order for the provision concerning molestation to apply, it has been found to require that the person being subject to the photographing has been aware of the photographing and in reality has been bothered by it.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>952.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>955.22</TimestampEnd>

			<Text>Here, the government forgets for some reason to mention the question of the perpetrator's intent.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>961.7</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>981.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But in any case, this means that both the crime of sexual molestation and the crime molestation have the same subjective requirement and are equally inapplicable in most cases concerning covert filming.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>981.1</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>We are here talking about the rights of the applicant, but it is easy to imagine if we turn this situation like a glove inside out, that we might be dealing with a situation in which the perpetrator, the stepfather of the applicant here, would have been the claimant here, would have been the appellant here, applicant here.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>4420.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4438.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In other words, in that situation, if he had been convicted, he would have asked the reverse question because it would fall under article seven and it would be a question of whether the legality principle was or was not violated in this situation.</Text>

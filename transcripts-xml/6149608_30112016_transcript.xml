			<Text>Mr. President and honorable judges,</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>243.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>261.58</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>it is an honor to be here today, but also a great responsibility as lawyers who strongly believe in the values that are the sacred goals of your mission, values which should always prevail over injustice and unfairness.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>261.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>281.74</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Our mission today is also to determine a clear guideline for every kind of situation in the future that will imply the private life in the workplace, so easily to be interfered with by the employer, especially when using modern ways of communication.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>281.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>285.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Our cases raise some fundamental questions.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>285.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>288.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Is spying in the workplace allowed?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>288.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>297.86</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Would anyone like their private communication violated without consent and for the single reason that it occurred during working hours?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>297.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>313.3</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Or would anyone like their private communication violated for the purpose of sustaining a previously decided termination of the labor agreement and for the sole reason to sustain such dismissal?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>313.3</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>323.06</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Or how Professor Pierce put it in a well-documented opinion, expressed also over the internet, is work privacy dead?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>323.06</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>351.68</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>When considering what to say here today before the court, we thought we would present the case as Judge Pinto said it in the dissenting opinion, like an opportunity, like an opportunity for the court to set standards as to work privacy and protection of communication that occurred during working hours.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>351.68</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>354.58</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But this case is much more than setting standards.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>354.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>355.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Why?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>355.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>358.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Because such standards already exist.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>358.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>364.46</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Because such standards are already provided by the previous case law of the court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>364.46</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>379.82</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So now we are here to enforce the standards, to further refine the standards, but taking into consideration the realities of modern communication through the internet.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>379.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>389.02</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So this case is before anything else about enforcing the standard and the correct application of Article 8 of the Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>389.02</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>400.74</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This case is also a chance to protect the fundamental private life in face of ad hoc, non-transparent internet surveillance in the workplace.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>400.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>407.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It's about sanctioning an abuse and about serving justice, even if it's in the ultimate instance.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>407.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>414.82</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It's also about the state failing to protect Mr. Barbulescu's fundamental human right</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>414.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>422.46</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>422.46</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>447.22</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is also the best occasion for the court to further develop its case law in the field of privacy with regard to employees' internet communication in an ever-changing world where the line between personal and work communication is shrinking continuously and can be diluted until there is none.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>447.22</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>459.26</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And finally, it is a chance to say no to spying in the work relationship and thus support healthy development of human relationships in the workplace.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>459.26</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>469.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>On the other hand, this case is not, and I emphasize, is not about protecting any fundamental right of the employer.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>469.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>480.78</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>480.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>483.86</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>483.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>494.46</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As we said it even from the beginning, workers do not abandon their right to privacy every time they walk through the doorstep of the workplace.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>494.46</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>504.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>On the other hand, workers have a legitimate expectation that a substantial degree of privacy exists in the workplace.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>504.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>504.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And why?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>504.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>509.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Because they develop a significant part of their relationship in the workplace.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>509.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>517.58</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I wonder if there is anybody here that does not develop human relationships in the workplace.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>517.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>529.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>On this road, we will firstly show that both the fundamental human right to private life as well as access to internet have been previously acknowledged by the court and significantly developed by the court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>529.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>543.14</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Secondly, we will show that the principles set out in the working document on the surveillance and the monitoring of electronic communication in the workplace have not been observed.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>543.14</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>551.66</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As the monitoring in this case was not transparent, was not necessary, was not fair towards Mr. Borbulescu,</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>551.66</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>556.7</TimestampEnd>

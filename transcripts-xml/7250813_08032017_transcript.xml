			<Text>At the heart of this case is the use of criminal proceedings to prevent the applicant, a senior representative of the principal opposition party in Georgia, the United National Movement, UNM, and a former minister of interior and prime minister from being able effectively to participate in the political process during the run up to the 2013 presidential election and subsequently.</Text>

		<Snippet>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>389.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>405.3</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, before the Grand Chamber, the government belatedly objects to admissibility of the applicant's complaints regarding the decision of 25th September 2013 on the basis of a failure to appeal to the investigative body of the Court of Appeals.</Text>

			<TimestampEnd>448.06</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This practice is reflected in the 2015 commentary on the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia and evidence by the decision of 21st September 2016, relied on by the government, in which the Kutaisi Court of Appeal specifically stated that parties may not appeal decisions on preventive measures adopted during pretrial conference.</Text>

			<Text>establishes that the real motive for his arrest and detention was to exclude him from political life, a point that we develop more fully in our submissions under Article 18, but which the court is asked to take into account now when assessing the compatibility of the applicant's arrest and detention with Article 5.</Text>

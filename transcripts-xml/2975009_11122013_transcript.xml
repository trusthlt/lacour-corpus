			<Text>Members of the court, if I wasn't nervous before, the list of dignitaries that you just read out would be more than sufficient to make me very nervous now.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>244.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>255.72</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The relevant dates are late April and early May 2003, the core focus being between the 23rd of April and the 2nd of May 2003.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>255.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>262.19</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So that period is almost entirely within the active hostilities phase of the armed conflict.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>262.19</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>268.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is not in dispute that that armed conflict was an international armed conflict.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>268.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>272.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It had commenced on the 20th of March 2003.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>272.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>284.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As the Grand Chamber noted in Al-Skaini at paragraph 10 and Al-Jadda at paragraph 26, British forces had captured Basra by the 5th of April 2003.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>284.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>291.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>United States troops had gained control of Baghdad by the 9th of April 2003.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>291.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>298.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And major combat operations were declared complete on the 1st of May 2003.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>298.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>316.72</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>From that date, as the Grand Chamber also specifically found in Al-Skaini at paragraph 143 and Al-Jadda at paragraph 77, the US and the UK became occupying powers within the meaning of article 42 of the Hague regulations.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>316.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>331.01</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Unsurprisingly, therefore, the Grand Chamber in Al-Skaini and Al-Jadda has already applied the 1st of May 2003 as the key date in terms of major combat operations in Iraq coming to an end.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>331.01</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>334.39</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>That was also the conclusion of the court in Al-Sadun.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>334.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>338.0</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>338.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>350.12</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It appears that the applicant takes issue with this finding, asserting an earlier date for the end of active hostilities at some point in early April 2003.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>350.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>353.96</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>353.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>364.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And we've set out our case in detail on that point in our additional observations of the 14th of October 2013 between paragraphs 21 and 31.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>364.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>371.88</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The issue has been dealt with correctly, as we submit, by the Grand Chamber in Al-Skaini and Al-Jadda.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>371.88</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>379.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The documents relied upon by the applicant simply do not support his proposition of an earlier end to that active hostilities phase.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>379.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>386.15</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>No doubt, certain major objectives have been achieved earlier in April 2003.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>386.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>393.07</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But the documents also plainly indicate the fact of serious, ongoing fighting.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>393.07</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>410.72</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There is nothing whatever to support a suggestion, which would have to be made by the applicant, that for some unspecified reason, the UK and the USA delayed the declaration of completion of major combat operations for one, two, or even three weeks.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>410.72</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>This case concerns a man called Tariq Hassan.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>416.32</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>425.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Early in the morning of the 23rd of April 2003, a military operation was carried out by British forces in Basra.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>425.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>436.12</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The aim of that operation was to capture a general in the Al-Quds Army, that is, in the army against which the coalition forces were fighting.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>436.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>440.75</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>He was thus a combatant and a legitimate military target.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>440.75</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>445.68</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>That general is now the applicant before this court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>445.68</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>449.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The British forces went to an address believed to be the general's house.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>449.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>451.75</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>451.75</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>454.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>462.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But they did find an adult male on the roof of the house with a Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>462.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>479.12</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The fact that many Iraqis might lawfully have carried AK-47s does not mean that the UK forces should have assumed, still less were required to assume, that this individual was lawfully doing so, especially when he had the assault rifle on the roof of the house.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>479.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>484.18</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And that house was the house of a general in the Al-Quds Army.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>484.18</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>494.03</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The key contemporaneous record at GA3, therefore, and we say with good reason, described this individual as, and I quote, a gunman.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>494.03</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>497.27</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>497.27</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>504.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>On being questioned, the individual admitted that he was the brother of the man being sought, that is, of the applicant.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>504.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>510.56</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>According to the applicant's own statements, the soldiers found further firearms in the house.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>510.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>515.96</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>535.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>548.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is clear first that the UK was entitled in international law to detain combatants as prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva Convention Number Three.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>548.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>557.39</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The circumstances of Tariq Hassan's capture more than justified detaining him on the basis that he was a suspected combatant.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>557.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>567.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The soldiers on the ground were unsurprisingly not well equipped, and indeed not even authorized to make any final decisions about his status.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>567.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>573.27</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So he was taken to Camp Bucca, B-U-C-C-A, for that to be done.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>573.27</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>580.13</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>586.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>He was interviewed again some 36 hours later on the morning of the 25th of April, 2003.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>586.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>597.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The view about his civilian status was confirmed, and it was additionally concluded that there was no reason to suspect that he was a security risk or a suspected criminal.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>597.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>602.56</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The decision was therefore taken at that point to release him.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>602.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>605.12</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>605.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>613.91</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The first is a suggestion that Tariq Hassan was detained in order to put pressure on the applicant to surrender himself.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>613.91</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>617.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>That suggestion is entirely without foundation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>617.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>621.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There is nothing in the records that have been discovered to support it.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>621.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>631.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is undermined by the fact that there were entirely proper and reasonable grounds on which to capture him, not least the fact that he was a gunman at the general's house.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>631.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>650.92</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As importantly, that suggestion is impossible to reconcile with the fact, which is clearly and unequivocally recorded in the contemporaneous documentation, the fact that a decision was taken to release Tariq Hassan less than 38 hours after his arrival at Camp Bucca.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>650.92</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>657.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The second matter to deal with is the complaints the applicant makes about recently discovered documentation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>657.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>662.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We can no doubt all agree that it is unfortunate that it was not discovered earlier.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>662.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>673.39</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>That is for the simple reason that the documentation now provides a much clearer picture, based on the contemporaneous records, of the circumstances of the capture of Tariq Hassan.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>673.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>679.68</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But we do not accept the criticism now made by the applicant about the late appearance of this material.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>679.68</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>688.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is easy in retrospect to assert that further electronic searches could have been made, which would have led to the earlier discovery of the documentation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>688.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>693.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, reasonable searches were made electronically in reasonable places.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>698.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>715.5</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it is unattractive indeed for too strident a criticism to be made in this case, in circumstances in which the applicant himself, for whatever unverifiable reason, delayed for a period of three years before even raising the matter with the British authorities.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>715.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>730.39</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>You have the citation of the Van Aver case, at paragraph 161 to 2, at paragraph 22 of our observations, for the importance the court attaches to the need to make timely complaints.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>730.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>739.39</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, the point of real significance here is that the complaints about late discovery of material do not advance the applicant's substantive case at all.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>739.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>750.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>They do not do so because he cannot properly, and does not seek, positively to suggest that the documentation now discovered is anything other than genuine and contemporaneous.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>750.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>763.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And once that is accepted, the documentation stands as highly relevant to, indeed, the best contemporaneous evidence of the circumstances of Tariq Hassan's capture.</Text>

			<Text>The reason I particularly don't want it to go by default is because when you go back to the relevant principles expanded by the Grand Chamber in Al-Skhaini, you will recall that when you came to deal with effective control of the area, one of the major distinctions between that basis of jurisdiction and state agent authority and control is that under the ECA head, the effective control of the area head, the Grand Chamber said the consequence of jurisdiction is established on that basis is that all the rights in the convention have to be secured to those who fall within the jurisdiction as compared to the divided and tailored approach that you get from state agent authority and control.</Text>

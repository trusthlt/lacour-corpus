      <text>The first question by Judge Ranzoni, which goes to say, which concrete measures could the authorities have taken in a situation where these unrests had lasted for more, for a longer period of time than actually happened in Copenhagen at the time, if this disturbance of peace had taken place for a number of days?</text>

      <text>I think the answer to that question is that we are bound also domestically by the limits of our constitution, which says that you have to be placed in front of a court or a judge within 24 hours of arrest.</text>

      <text>These detentions are short-term, we have a specific situation here of a seven and a half hour detention, but most of the detentions would probably be of a much shorter character so it probably wouldn't be feasible to put persons in front of a court before they are released and I don't think it would be for the benefit of the persons having been detained they want to be released as soon as possible.</text>

			<TimestampBegin>297.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>305.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This law permits such sentences to be imposed only on men and only between the ages of 18 to 65.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>305.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>329.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicants complain that their sentence to life imprisonment contradicts the requirements of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 5 of the Convention, as they, being male convicts of 30 and 26 years of age at the moment of conviction, fell within the category of the persons who could be sentenced to life imprisonment according to the Russian legislation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>329.37</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>341.73</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>360.25</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>368.25</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>393.05</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>403.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>410.73</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As an initial matter, the applicants strongly object to the government's characterization of what the applicants seek in the case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>410.73</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>417.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We reiterate that they do not ask the authorities for the imposition of stricter punishment on anyone.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>417.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>430.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Rather, since the government has commendedly already extended humane treatment to women, children, and men over 65 years of age, the applicants simply seek the same humane treatment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>430.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>444.97</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Further, it is utterly irrelevant to assert, as the government does, that the applicants cannot claim to be victims of a violation of the convention, as no separate issue rises under Article 5.1A of the convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>444.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>470.77</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicants do not claim violation of Article 5 of the convention, but rather violation of their rights under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 5 of the convention, as they are excluded solely on the basis of their gender and age from the humane treatment of categories of convicts who are protected from the most severe type of punishment in the Russian Federation, life imprisonment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>470.77</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>482.79</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We rely on the court's well-established case law, according to which the application of Article 14 of the convention does not presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights protected by the convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>482.79</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>493.11</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>What is necessary and also sufficient is that the facts of the case fall within the ambit of one or more of the articles of the convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>493.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>510.29</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the case at hand, we claim that the facts of the present case fall within the ambit of Article 5 of the convention, as the court has long recognized that the right to liberty under Article 5 of the convention contemplates the physical liberty of the person.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>510.29</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>528.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The case of Clift versus United Kingdom provides one example that is of particular relevance to the present case, because the court sustained a claim that discrimination as to the length of sentence in a penal institution amounts to violation of Article 5 taken together with Article 14.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>528.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>540.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Equally irrelevant is the government's reference to the case law on Article 3 regarding the life imprisonment, because the applicants did not raise a claim of violation of Article 3 of the convention.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>542.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>552.85</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>now I would like to turn to the question whether there has been a violation of Article 14 of the convention taken in conjunction with Article 5.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>552.85</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>560.69</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>572.13</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicants contend that imposition of life imprisonment only on male convicts aged 18 to 65 is discriminatory on the grounds of age and sex.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>572.13</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>590.53</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In other words, under the provisions of Article 57 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, the applicants, due to their gender and age, were treated less favorably than persons who were convicted of similar and comparable crimes, but were of a different gender and of a different age.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>590.53</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>596.05</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>606.97</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>606.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>620.05</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the present case, the government had the burden to demonstrate reasons that could justify the difference in the sentences policies under Article 57 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>627.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>650.49</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Furthermore, and most importantly, the court has established through its case law that the notion of discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 of the convention includes cases where a person or group is treated without proper justification, less favorably than another, even though the more favorable treatment is not called for by the convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>650.49</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>666.67</TimestampBegin>

			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>678.33</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>The last issue that I would like to turn to is the applicability of the marginal appreciation as insisted by the government.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>686.49</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>701.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As the court ruled in a number of cases, including Glore versus Switzerland and Kuytyn versus Russia, the scope of the marginal appreciation of the member state varies according to the circumstances, the subject matter, and its background.</Text>

			<Text>I will discuss the issues of lack of justification of the difference in treatment between the applicant and the other categories of convicts in relation to their gender and age under Article 57 of the Russian Criminal Code.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>804.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>816.72</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>816.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>831.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As the Court held in the case of Abdulaziz Kabalis and Valkandali, very weighty reasons would have to be advanced before a difference of treatment on the ground of gender could be regarded as compatible with the Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>831.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>850.12</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the present case, the government failed to demonstrate such weighty reasons, and hence, the difference in sentencing policies applicable to men and women amounts to gender prejudice, and it is nothing but the product of outdated and traditionalist view on the social role of women.</Text>

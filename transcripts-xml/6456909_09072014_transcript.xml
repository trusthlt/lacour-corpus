			<Text>Thus, by stating shortly the applicable law, I apply it to the present case by firstly submitting that this obligation for the comments platform operator to ensure that no one's rights are infringed is not prescribed by law.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>966.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>975.55</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>990.55</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>1015.03</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Namely, the Council of Europe Declaration on Freedom of Communication on the Internet from 2003 ties the providers of internet services and the Article 10 together, stating that an intermediary could be co-responsible with a user only if it becomes aware of the legal nature of user's content and does not act expeditiously to remove it.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>1074.87</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>1094.39</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>If that would be true and the applicant would qualify as a classical publisher, not only regarding its articles by journalists, but also regarding comments platform, the applicant would have had no reason to argue against the first section ruling and the Grand Chamber would have had no reason to accept this case for reconsideration.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>1094.39</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>1249.75</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>1268.15</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>1268.15</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>As Article 19, Media Legal Defense Initiative, and other friends of this court have put it, qualification of a host of comments platform as an intermediary, and thus granting it benefits of conditional liability exemptions, is a minimum standard acknowledged globally for intermediaries such as social media, picture and video communities, blogs, and news portals with comment platforms.</Text>

			<Text>Although Delfi's judgment was the first judgment where liability of an online news portal was assessed in changing circumstances, there is always a first case which sets the precedent and where the existing law can be interpreted and to new technical solutions as well.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5423.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5442.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But previous case law was clear about the liability of the publisher and did not leave any doubts that the disclosure is liable for defaming comments if it is guilty and regardless of the means of disclosing.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5442.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5456.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We are of the opinion that Delfi should have ensured when allowing anonymous commentators to post comments on Delfi's webpage that the rights of third persons were protected as well.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5456.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5470.32</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Since Delfi was not an intermediary, publishing comments was part of its journalistic activities as we have established by the facts of the case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5470.32</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5481.4</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And Delfi executed control over the comments which also means that it took the liability over the comments.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5481.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5505.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Concerning your question about the references or the comparisons to Facebook and Twitter, we find that first and foremost the difference lies in the fact that in other forums a person owning a profile or account can amend and delete what he has uploaded.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5505.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5511.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In addition, in such environments people themselves initiate new themes.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5511.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5527.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Delfi instead publishes an article it finds to be of public interest and asks people to comment that article and relates the comments to its journalistic activities, profiting on those comments.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5527.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5558.88</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thus, if social media networks function on different bases, and we cannot here give the answer how and when they will be liable, but it is always for the courts to evaluate the facts of the case and evaluate whether that service provider in question have been active or have it been passive.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5558.88</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5577.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it's very likely that in case of Facebook or Twitter, those portals are found to be passive and neutral and the EU directive foreseeing the exemptions from liability might be applicable to those portals.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5577.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5600.72</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And finally, concerning your question about actual knowledge and willful blindness, Delfi had created an environment where it was possible to comment articles of a certain degree of public interest without any identification whatsoever.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5600.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5636.56</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The article on the question dealt with a subject that negatively affected a large number of people, therefore the domestic courts and the chamber agreed that in this case Delfi could have realized that it might cause negative reactions and considering the general reputation of comments on Delfi's news portal, there was a higher than average risk that the negative comments could go beyond the boundaries of acceptable criticism and reach a level which is not allowed.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5636.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5644.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The indicators were, among others, number of the comments posted on the article in question indicated a great deal.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5644.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5659.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Delfi itself kept the article on the top of the page longer, so it should have been cautious about the consequences.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5659.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5670.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I would like to reply to the question put by Judge Raimondi regarding possible changes to Estonian legislation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5670.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5676.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>No, the Estonian case law is consistent, there is no gap.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5676.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5704.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There has been only a few cases, but it is sufficient for acknowledging that also online news portal is jointly liable with the authors of anonymous comments, as the media organizations have always been jointly liable with the authors, and the online publishers have themselves taken measures to balance the different rights, as we have indicated in our memorial.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5704.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5723.72</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>They do moderating, they have filtering systems, they might make difference between subjects which need registering or which can be commented anonymously.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5723.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5735.56</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is the portal's choice what measures to take, but it is for the portal to guarantee the balance between different rights.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5735.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5764.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it is always for the domestic courts to assess whether the exemption deriving from the EU law is applicable or not, and I would also again like to highlight or stress that no hosts have been held liable under general civil law regulation in Estonia, neither before Delfi's judgment or after it.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5764.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5796.56</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Judge Simela did not put questions to the government, but I would still like to comment the question about freedom of expression in internet, because the government wants to underline that the disclosure of information in internet should also not infringe the rights of third persons, which are protected by Article 8 of the Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5796.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5808.68</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thus we cannot see how the freedom of expression in internet could be limitless if it is not limitless in other forums.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5808.68</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5818.72</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And finally I would like to make two remarks regarding what has been expressed by Delfi earlier.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5818.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5834.02</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Namely the domestic courts did not establish that the applicant was an intermediary, although Delfi has called itself to be an intermediary today again.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5834.02</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5861.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It was for the applicants in domestic courts to prove the circumstances that it could rely on the exemptions that it was an intermediary, but Delfi could not establish it in the domestic courts, so we are of the opinion that this fact that Delfi was not an intermediary and it was a publisher cannot be changed here and today anymore.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5861.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5868.7</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And secondly the government wishes to underline that the domestic courts evaluated the facts in aggregate.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5868.7</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5884.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It was taken into account how the portal was structured and how the comments were integrated into the journalistic activities of Delfi, and only thereafter it was established that Delfi was a publisher.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5884.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5884.96</TimestampEnd>

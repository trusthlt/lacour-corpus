		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>269.95</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>282.47</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Under Hungarian law there is a legal regulation which entered into force in 2013 ordering the disbursement of the pensions of those who continue working in the public sphere.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>282.47</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>284.95</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>What is at stake in the present case?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>284.95</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>294.75</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is undisputed that the applicant, as a Hungarian employee, month by month paid contributions to the Pension Fund of Hungary in his entire life.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>294.75</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>302.87</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>His regular payments create a property right, namely a legitimate expectation of acquiring his pension.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>302.87</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>308.39</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>That's why Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is clearly applicable in the present case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>308.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>317.71</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, the applicant was unfortunately deprived of his entire pension just because of the fact that he continued working in the public sector.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>317.71</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>322.47</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>One could ask whether this intervention served the general interest.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>322.55</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>329.75</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government naturally tried to substantiate this measure by referring to the general interest as such.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>329.75</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>340.27</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, in fact, even the government could not rely insofar on any real specific aim sold by this harsh intervention to the applicant's property right.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>340.27</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>352.43</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In particular, it did not rely on or prove the government any causal link between the total deprivation at issue and the control of use of property in accordance with the general interest.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>352.43</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>361.35</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This is no wonder, as even according to the government, the Hungarian Pension Fund has year by year more income than expenditure.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>361.35</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>375.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Even the aim referred to by the government in general, allegedly to reduce public debt and help to escape the European Union's excessive deficit procedure, is unfortunately clearly invalid and untrue.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>375.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>391.27</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In fact, Hungary successfully got out of the European Union's excessive deficit procedure already on the 21st of June 2013, undisputedly prior to the start of the suspension of the applicant's pension.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>

			<Text>This is an article which discloses the fact that in reality, there is a yearly surplus in the state pension fund which amounted just in year 2014 to 183.3 billion Hungarian forints.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>412.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>419.15</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government indicated insofar a number of different figures as the alleged savings of the budget.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>419.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>431.99</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Due to the impugned law, however, let me remind you that none of them was higher to 10 billion Hungarian forints per year, namely almost 20 times smaller to the above savings.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>431.99</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>439.15</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This fact is important as the government apparently tries to rely on the alleged financial troubles of the budget.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>439.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>446.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This 183.3 billion Hungarian forints surplus is a prime facie evidence</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>446.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>453.47</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>that the discrimination at issue cannot be substantiated by these alleged financial troubles.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>453.47</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>465.99</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In fact, the surplus disappeared in the state budget and served as the financial basis of, for instance, the renovation or building a number of football stadiums and so on.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>465.99</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>471.07</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>471.07</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>476.07</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>476.07</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>483.11</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant, similarly to some 2,000 other Hungarian pensioners, was discriminated two different ways.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>483.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>497.71</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>First of all, he was discriminated against in respect of those pensioners who continued working in the private sphere and who could and still can have their respective pension without any restriction whatsoever.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>497.71</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>506.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>These pensions are naturally paid from the very same Hungarian pension fund the applicant's one is supposed to be paid from.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>506.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>511.67</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>511.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>517.55</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, the Hungarian legal regulation has an even more astonishing characteristic.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>517.55</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>530.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The law prescribing the total disbursement of pensions does not concern the entire population working in the public sphere, but there are some categories exempted from this regulation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>530.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>542.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As the regulation indicates, just the categories concerned, but not those who are exempted, there is some uncertainty even at the government in respect of the categories exempted.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>542.35</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>563.87</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>For instance, in point 26 of their memorial of 5 September 2016 to the court, even the government themselves admitted explicitly that ministers are exempted, while just a few weeks later in their submission of 30 September 2016, they stressed that all categories concerned are elected.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>563.87</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>575.83</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I would point out that ministers in Hungary have never ever been elected, in particular not since 2013 when the regulation at issue entered into force.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>575.83</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>586.51</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Moreover, in this latest submission of the government, nominates just two categories, namely members of parliament and mayors of municipal governments as exempted ones.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>605.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>615.95</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>From this report to the government prepared by the Ministry of Justice in March 2016, it is perfectly clear that in fact there are several more categories exempted.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>615.95</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>In Torelia, certain categories of judges, prosecutors and public officers employed who are not elected in Hungary either.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>633.87</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>654.51</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It has been not disputed by the government why members of parliament, mayors, members of local authorities, ministers and so on enjoying multiple remunerations should reserve their pension, whilst average public sphere workers like teachers, most of the judges, administrators and so on should not.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>654.51</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>666.75</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Even if all categories exempted from the above regulation would be elected, which is not the case, this still could not serve as a reasonable justification for the above difference in treatment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>666.75</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>673.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Nevertheless, as we have seen, at least a few categories of those exempted from the regulation at issue are not elected.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>673.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>680.23</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>680.23</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>694.47</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Another categorization could theoretically be based upon the distinction whether those who are exempted hold statuses regulated in the fundamental law as the Hungarian constitution at present is officially called.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>694.47</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>710.27</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, we have to see it perfectly clear that a number of statuses are in fact regulated by the fundamental law, whilst the holders thereof are also deprived of their pension, for instance, most of the judges, public attorneys and so on.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>710.27</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>723.87</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Summing up the above categories, we must conclude that as far as the legal regulation at issue is concerned, we are unable to find any relevant category substantiating the present difference in treatment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>723.87</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>733.91</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>At least one part of pensioners belonging to each category is deprived of their pension, whilst on the other hand, the other part of the same population is not.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>733.91</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>750.11</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Accordingly, we can only conclude that the discrimination between the different groups of pensioners in the public sector is purely arbitrary and has nothing to do either with any legitimate aim or with any objective and reasonable justification.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>750.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>762.07</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Probably even the government themselves see this problem and that is the reason why in their observations submitted to the court relied on the alleged public sense of justice.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>762.07</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>772.79</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We have serious doubts whether such a vague and obscure principle could even theoretically serve as a reasonable justification of any discrimination.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>772.79</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>783.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It has however never been disputed even by the government that there has never been in Hungary any public debate in this respect, not even a simple public opinion research.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>783.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>790.87</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Accordingly, the government is not in a position to rely on any evidence whatsoever in that respect.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>790.87</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>801.87</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Nevertheless, it is well known from history that the public sense of justice, if there is any at all, can be very easily manipulated by the regime.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>801.91</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>823.27</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>If the public sense of justice could be accepted as a legitimate ground or aim, any government could easily form the public feeling the way that is suitable for the regime's actual aims, irrespectively whether it is compatible with the obligations of the convention or other international covenants or not.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>823.27</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>835.83</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this respect, I would draw attention also to the fact that the court found violation in the case of Heschman and Harrop versus the United Kingdom, judgment 25 November 1999.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>835.83</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>854.55</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this case, conduct contra bonos mores, which was defined as behavior which is wrong rather than right in the judgment of the majority of contemporary fellow citizens, did not meet the requirement of foreseeability, see paragraphs 29 to 45.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>854.55</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>864.59</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Consequently, as far as a legitimate aim is concerned, such a referral casts serious doubts concerning the lawfulness of the measure in question.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>864.59</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>883.83</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Insofar, when I was speaking about the lack of a legitimate aim and the lack of an objective and reasonable justification in respect of the discrimination, both of them concerned the legal regulation at issue, namely the amendment of the Pension Act, Act 91 of 1997.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>883.83</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>886.87</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This Act gives a somewhat vague and obscure list.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>886.87</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>899.35</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, due to the Act, it is perfectly clear that teachers, medical care employees, administrative officers, and so on, working in the public sector are not exempted from this list.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>899.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>920.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, there is a further legal regulation in Hungary, namely Act 84 of 2003, which provides the theoretical opportunity to individual cases that the entire amount of pension suspended by the amendment of the Pension Act could be reimbursed from the same national budget.</Text>

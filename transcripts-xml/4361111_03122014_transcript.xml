			<Text>My understanding of that is that the government has said in that case, the court should not go on to deal with the question of substantive risk on return.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>5073.91</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>Well, nothing as far as we can see, because his only option then would be to try and raise any ground of risk as a new circumstance.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5085.95</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5092.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And of course, as the migration court held several years ago, religion is not a new circumstance.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5092.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5106.15</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And even at that stage, the further aspects of his faith and the further factors pointing to risk arising from his faith, which had arisen at that stage, even those were not treated as new circumstances.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5106.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5120.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Nor did the Swedish legislation allow the national authorities, having held there were no new circumstances, to go on and ask, well, even if they're not new, is there a reasonable excuse why they weren't raised earlier?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5120.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5142.55</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So our very real fear is that if the court were to find, based on what the national authorities could be expected to know at the time, there wasn't a procedural error, and then the case is sent back to Sweden, so to speak, that the Swedish government would enforce the deportation order.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5142.55</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5155.19</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And that would mean that the applicant would be sent to Iran to all the very real and extremely troubling risks that face him there without any assessment of the risks facing him on grounds of his religion.</Text>

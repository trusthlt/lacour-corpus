		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4839.05</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampEnd>4910.05</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I have to point out that the way that these questions were answered by the judgment, the Chamber judgment, is sort of tautological, because the Chamber did not answer the question whether the legislation that creates the impossibility of one of the condition precedent to be met is to be the issue, but they focused on the situation upon the implementation of the question.</Text>

			<Text>Well, I will speak first, and then I will ask you to give one more floor to Dr. Bellabile.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>5413.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5420.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Well, there was a question by Judge Pardalos about administrative proceedings in order to get a license.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5420.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5429.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Well, this is an administrative proceeding based on a request, and you have to fulfill, obviously, the legal obligations.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5429.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5436.9</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5436.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5447.34</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Five years ago, there was a difference that the law thought of a local, how to say, check whether these conditions are fulfilled.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5447.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5452.3</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Now this is not required, so the procedure is somewhat easier.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5452.3</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5457.4</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Normally, you have to ask the regional authority.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5457.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5472.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Then there is a possibility of appeal to the Ministry of Health and then possibly, because it's a matter of right under administrative law, then you could lodge an administrative action with the administrative court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5472.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5477.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There was no real request for running a Bell Center.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5477.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5491.9</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, there is no what we call application practice, nor an established interpretation even of the 15-minute condition.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5491.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5510.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As far as the so-called on-purpose reaction by the Ministry of Health, well, it was in reaction to a request for interpretation of the law, and the Minister of Health made it clear how this should be interpreted.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5510.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5527.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>He did mention all the necessary secondary legislation in our written submission, so I would like to raise my voice against saying that we have been hiding something.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5527.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5543.9</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As far as the so-called labor artist approach for having an operation hall or a hall to carry out surgery, the applicants say obstetric surgery room.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5543.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5554.5</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Well, we think this is an inaccurate translation of the words porognizale, which look like birthing room, then obstetric surgery room.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5554.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5558.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Then there was a question about statistics by Judge LaFranca.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5558.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5569.2</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>5569.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5576.2</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5576.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5580.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We mentioned that in our speech, so I refer to it.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5580.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5587.7</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We don't have any information about having some 1,000 births outside health care facilities.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5587.7</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5592.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So there are some statistics available to the state.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5592.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5609.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I would also like to highlight what I've already said, that the system sends a clear signal to women that home birth is less safe, and that is also why there is only a few women in the Czech Republic giving birth to their children at home.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5609.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5618.7</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As far as paragraph 2696 of the Chamber Judgment, I would like to refer to Annex 5 to our memorial to the Grand Chamber.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5618.7</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5641.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And as far as the emergency arrival and departure is concerned, we have to think that if the legislation in case of a general emergency or ambulance foresees a 20-minute time limit, this means that the emergency, the ambulance has to come in 20 minutes, then it has to go.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5641.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5646.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So it means that it's a much longer period.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5646.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5658.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As far as the European Union legislation, it bears on qualifications of midwives, not about the way births or deliveries are carried out in the member states.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5658.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5665.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There is no consensus, there is no regulation, harmonization of the way deliveries are carried out.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5665.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5675.5</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And moreover, it is a matter of Union law, and you know how the Court of Justice of the European Communities is sensitive to this issue.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5675.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5681.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So, well, it's really difficult to comment upon that.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5681.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5695.4</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I would probably say before delegating the floor to Dr. Bellebile, that the real substance of the case</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5695.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5708.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>is that if you have a safer environment equipped to deal with complications, then reason says it is safer.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5708.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5720.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I don't think there is a real dispute on this issue, and if only we save one child per year, it's better than not to save the child.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5720.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5741.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I would also like to say that we can discuss various scientific research available, but we have also to bear in mind, and that is about the margin of appreciation of the national consensus and so on, that the situation in various countries is not the same.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5741.8</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5747.3</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5751.7</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I would also like to highlight that things are moving.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5751.7</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5758.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This is not something which is carved in the stone and does not move at all.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5758.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5764.0</TimestampEnd>

			<Text>For example, if you have premature separation of placenta from uterine wall during labor, okay, this is the situation when there is immediate, abrupt stop of the oxygen supply to the baby.</Text>

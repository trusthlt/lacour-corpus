		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>430.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>444.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There are compelling reasons why this court may wish to hold that bulk interception regimes of the scale and intensity as that in the present case can never constitute a justified interference with Article 8.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>444.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>464.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Whenever this court has examined a secret surveillance system and gone on to hold that they are in fact compatible with the Convention, it has often justified doing so by the reference to its targeted, specific, and contained nature, the very opposing qualities of that of a large-scale modern bulk interception regime.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>464.1</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>472.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>486.86</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>If, however, the court decides that the bulk interception surveillance such as that in the present case falls within a member state's margin of appreciation, it must surely acknowledge that it falls on its outermost edge.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>486.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>496.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And this fact must color the way in which the court assesses the quality of the safeguards that must be in place at the national level.</Text>

			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>496.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>508.34</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>European supervision of the margin of appreciation must demand safeguards that are truly robust and commensurate with the privacy risks that a system presents.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>543.25</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>587.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>598.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It has been a longstanding feature in this court's case law that the duration of surveillance operations must be subject to certain limits in order to protect against their excessive use.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>598.36</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>624.13</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>635.86</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>655.17</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>663.06</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It states that a warrant may be valid for a maximum period of six months and may be subject to renewal at six monthly intervals.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>663.06</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>672.06</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>672.06</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>687.69</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Unlike in a criminal surveillance operation, which is governed by the Swedish code of judicial procedure, there is no legal obligation to cancel a warrant when the required conditions have ceased to exist or the measures themselves are no longer necessary.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>687.69</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>As the court in its chamber judgment in Big Brother, the court said that bulk surveillance is by definition untargeted, and because of that, it would be incompatible to have a, it is by definition untargeted, and it is not possible then to have a requirement of reasonable suspicion.</Text>

		<Snippet>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5377.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5400.41</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it is in those circumstances that the applicant's position is that in order for the authorizing body to make a proper proportionality review of a bulk surveillance mission, it needs to take into consideration whether the individual targeted meets, there is a requirement of reasonable suspicion that is met.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5400.41</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5481.15</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5496.67</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5541.3</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5553.65</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5563.53</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5581.05</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And our position is that this crucial safeguard relating to when the FRA can transfer the bulk of data that they have intercepted to a third country or an international organization needs to be set out clearly in statute law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5581.05</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5621.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5643.51</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And to the applicant, this position seems incompatible with the Court's established principles, first laid down in Klas, then reiterated in Kennedy, and then affirmed by the Grand Chamber in Sakharov, that the mere existence of a piece of legislation like this can constitute an interference with the applicant's rights.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5736.61</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5744.57</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5755.07</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5773.84</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>5773.84</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5796.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5817.09</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The final misconception was about whether the administrative court, which can be drawn into this situation of different reporting activities from the inspectorate, whether the administrative court in Stockholm may get full access to the documents at the FRA and the inspection.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5817.09</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>So to respond to your more specific question regarding a message on Facebook or Instagram, collection may not target signals between a sender and a recipient who are both situated in Sweden.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6145.66</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6152.14</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Sender-recipient normally would refer to natural persons who are communicating with each other.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6152.14</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6165.32</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And when a natural person communicates also with an automated service, the same reasoning would apply under Swedish law with respect to the significance of the geographic location of sender and recipient.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6165.32</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6173.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Also, because one is sometimes asked that question, when two persons in Sweden communicate, it doesn't matter which citizenship they have.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>6173.44</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6178.68</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6192.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So the response would be that communication, be it via Facebook or Instagram, but in a domestic context, would not be collected.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6192.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6214.05</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I'd like now to turn, if I may, to the questions posed by Judge Pinto de Albuquerque, starting with the point on the position of my government when it comes to the Zakharov criteria, as specified in paragraph 231 of the judgment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6214.05</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6233.4</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is our position that those criteria do apply to signals intelligence regimes, but with a minor adaptation, which is motivated by the fact that the criteria have essentially been developed in case law concerning secret measures of surveillance in criminal investigations.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6233.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6242.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And here I would refer to paragraph 68 to 72 of the government's observations of May this year.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6246.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6254.76</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is, of course, also our position that it does not follow from the Zakharov judgment that there would be any requirement of reasonable suspicion.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6254.76</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6275.56</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Judge Pinto de Albuquerque, you also asked the question, is there a risk when it comes to the delimitation between signals intelligence within foreign intelligence and criminal investigation that there could be a slippery slope in the Swedish system?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6275.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6280.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I would respectfully say no.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6280.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6285.12</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6285.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6293.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The legislation is absolutely clear on the delimitation between the two.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6293.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6297.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And as I outlined earlier, there are consequences linked to that delimitation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6300.93</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6319.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Swedish Security Service and the NOA may issue detailed tasking directives for signals intelligence, but they may not do so for the purpose of investigating criminal activities.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6319.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6327.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So according to my government, the legislation draws a very clear line between foreign intelligence and law enforcement.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6327.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6341.52</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And while the Swedish Security Service may, in some instances, be granted direct access to some data, this possibility is very limited.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6341.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6346.97</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And here I would refer you to paragraph 117, appendix 1, of our observations.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6357.05</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6382.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I was then asked the question about the role of the inspectorate and the position of the judges within the personnel and staffing regulations, which are there.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6382.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6401.28</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is correct to say that the foreign intelligence inspectorate consists of a board, an office, which is described in the annual report, which we have submitted to the court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6401.28</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6415.56</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6428.85</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6445.05</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is correct to say that they work part time, but it would be equally correct to say that they work the time that is necessary to fulfill the supervisory duties which the inspectorate is assigned.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6445.05</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6453.81</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6453.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6462.94</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6468.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6503.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>With regard to the question related to the report of the Human Rights Committee of 2016, while that report did not lead to any specific decisions with regard to the system for signals intelligence, I hope that my government has demonstrated to the court that the whole Swedish signals intelligence regime is constantly subject to scrutiny and review by independent bodies who report on their findings.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6503.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6511.81</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So there is a constant process of looking at how the system works and how the safeguards that are within it truly function.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6517.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6535.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>If I might then turn to the question with regard to international cooperation sharing data with countries outside the community of Council of Europe countries.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6535.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6545.93</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Firstly, to state again that international cooperation is regulated in law, and it is conducted in accordance with specific instructions from the government.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6545.93</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6562.12</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>If I were to turn first to data going out from Sweden under that form of international cooperation, FRA guidelines require that international partners respect Swedish regulations.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6562.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6573.78</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6573.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6585.05</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>For the sake of completeness, I'll also make a comment on data coming in, although that issue is essentially outside the scope of the examination by the ground chamber.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6585.05</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6600.68</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But just to complement what has been said previously, that the internal regulations of the FRA state that those regulations also apply to material received from foreign partners.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6600.68</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6609.81</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6609.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6622.18</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And finally, on this point, does it actually work to reiterate to the court that the full functioning of this system is subject to oversight?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6622.18</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6634.2</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>6650.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6666.36</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6666.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6679.36</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>6685.93</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6700.24</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6700.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6706.23</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>On a more specific point, if I might turn to the issue of data protection for legal persons.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>6722.09</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>And while recognizing that there is every need to prevent the public from abuse and to have safeguards in place, my government would argue that the remedies and the safeguards the Swedish system includes are effective and robust, as found by the third chamber, and one which does provide the protection that could be expected in a system governed by the convention.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>228.92</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>236.22</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>these applications raise issues of the utmost importance for the United Kingdom.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>236.22</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>253.18</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>If the applicant's case on the legal requirements for interception and intelligence sharing in this context were to be accepted, the results would be profound damage to the capabilities and work of the UK intelligence services.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>253.18</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>275.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The nature of the safeguards against unwarranted intrusion on the right to proper respect for privacy need, we say, to take into account the impact on the ability of the government to protect the lives and safety of the public, all the more so in the light of the string of recent and appalling atrocities across Europe.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>275.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>298.4</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>That balance, that sensitivity to the need not unduly to impede contracting states' ability to fulfill their paradigm-protective responsibilities, is inherent in the fundamental structure of the Convention and has been a hallmark of this court's jurisprudence in this area, and rightly so.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>298.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>305.24</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>305.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>314.24</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>314.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>329.68</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But it is to be noted at the outset, when considering these balances, that whilst privacy rights are, of course, of importance and to be respected, the right to life and, indeed, the safety of citizens is paramount.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>329.68</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>336.12</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>350.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>364.92</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The core problem at the heart of the applicants' case is that they seek to conjure up, by reference to what we suggest are grossly inaccurate speculations presented as fact, a specter of vast privacy intrusion.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>364.92</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>375.92</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>They ignore or seek to downplay the wide-ranging safeguarding built into the domestic regime and then simply ignore the critical need to protect lives.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>375.92</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>385.88</TimestampEnd>

			<Text>The importance of those powers has been the subject of detailed and repeated consideration by a series of independent bodies in recent years, by the independent reviewer of terrorism, David Anderson QC, whose report is at tab 50 of your bundle, by the Intelligence and Security Committee in Parliament, whose report, in relevant part, is at tab 47 of your bundle, by the Interception Commissioner, and by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, the IPT.</Text>

			<Text>Most recently, in a judgment of the 8th of September, 2017, behind tab 21 of your bundles, the IPT, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, has referred a series of questions back to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg post the Watson decision.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>554.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>567.88</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In relevant part, they questioned whether the sorts of safeguards identified in Watson and Digital Rights Ireland could possibly work in the national security context that we are dealing with here.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>567.88</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>579.96</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>617.76</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>631.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>First, that the use of bulk data capabilities is, quote, critical to the ability of the security and intelligence agencies to secure national security and essential to the protection of that national security.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>631.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>640.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Second, a fundamental feature they found of many of the techniques of interrogating bulk data is that they are non-targeted.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>640.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>650.4</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As they noted, the capacity to intercept communications in bulk is critical for the discovery of threats and intelligence targets.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>650.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>663.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The intelligence services rely on the use of small pieces of intelligence information obtained through bulk interception in order to find new threats and those responsible for them.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>663.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>674.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As the Intelligence and Security Committee said in their 2014 report, quote, it is essential that the agencies can discover unknown threats.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>674.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>679.52</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>679.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>683.32</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>683.32</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>707.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Indeed, often this is the only way to obtain even a small proportion of the communications of known targets overseas in circumstances where they are very likely to use a variety of means of communication and change those means frequently and where electronic communications travel over a variety of different routes to reach their intended destination.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>707.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>717.52</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As the IPT pointed out, this is very different from the use of data in an investigation of a criminal offence by police.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>717.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>725.76</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The police may well have identified a suspect who can then be made the subject of a targeted investigation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>725.76</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>735.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>757.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The IPT gave an example of how it had been possible to use bulk data in this way to establish by applying a number of filters and matches to reduce a pool of some 27,000 candidates so that one person was identified as a suspected al-Qaeda suicide bomber.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>757.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>771.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The IPT thus concluded that bulk communications data, quote, is of particular value in identifying potential threats by persons who are not the target of any investigation.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>774.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>802.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>If in a national security context such as the present, procedural requirements of the kind referred to by the CJU in Watson were to be applied to measures taken in the bulk data sphere to protect national security, and I quote from the IPT's judgment at paragraph 69, they would frustrate them and put the national security of the UK and it may be other member states at risk.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>802.84</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>In the RE and the United Kingdom case, this court established in paragraphs 129 and 30 of its judgment that the decisive factor in deciding what Article 8 safeguards are needed to prevent arbitrary or disproportionate interference with privacy is the extent of the interference with an individual right to respect for a person's private life in a particular context, not the definition of the technological means used to conduct the intrusion.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampEnd>7499.66</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>7600.14</TimestampBegin>

			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7606.62</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7622.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7638.26</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I think that also answers the final part of that question, which is, is there any independent body who can issue, as it were, some binding instruction about filtering or search terms?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7638.26</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7648.46</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7654.74</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And the answer to that is that there aren't any set rules of that kind that apply to analysts.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7654.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7676.74</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But that, in my respectful submission, is not necessarily or at all a vice of the system or a necessary part of it if one recognizes, as one must, that whatever search terms they use have to be justified as necessary and proportionate and have to be the subject of a record so that they can be overseen.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7676.74</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7699.86</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And so although there aren't, as it were, set structural limitations on the nature of search terms, in particular because the flexibility is truly necessary to enable the interrogation to perform its useful function, they still have to justify against that standard, the convention standard, and they still have to create records so that others can oversee.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7699.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7733.38</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And of course, to come to the final bit of it, if commissioners, in conducting their auditing function, were to come across, for example, regular use that they considered was inappropriate of particular types of search term or examination, the mechanisms by which that was done, if they were to consider that to be inappropriate in a general sense, for example, then the commissioner has all the constitutional mechanisms that exist to enable them to draw matters to the attention, for example, of the prime minister.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7733.38</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7745.1</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7745.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7756.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And so in the hypothetical example that I've given where they're not satisfied with the way in which searching is done, for example, there are mechanisms for elevating that.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7756.54</TimestampBegin>

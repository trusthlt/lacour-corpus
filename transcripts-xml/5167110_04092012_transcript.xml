			<TimestampBegin>360.7</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>373.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>382.18</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This notion is reflected in the case law, first at the level of determining whether there has been an interference with Article 9 rights at all.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>382.18</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>394.06</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>420.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>436.7</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>My submission to this Court is that there is no basis for interfering with that conclusion, particularly given the subsidiary role of the Court in an area in which local needs and conditions are likely to be critical and a wide margin of appreciation appropriate.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>436.7</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>443.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>447.58</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>447.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>453.42</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>First, Article 9 primarily protects personal beliefs.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>453.42</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>459.06</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Protection is also accorded to religious practice, as enumerated in that article.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>459.06</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>465.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But it is not every act or form of behaviour that falls within the protective sphere of Article 9.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>465.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>475.58</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Acts are protected only if they are indeed a practice, and moreover if the practice is generally recognised as such by the religion concerned.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>475.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>489.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The description from the Court's constant jurisprudence refers to acts of worship or devotion which are aspects of the practice of a religion or belief in a generally recognised form.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>507.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>528.86</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It was put in this way in Kalach at paragraph 27, that because Article 9 does not protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief, in exercising his freedom to manifest his religion, an individual may need to take his specific situation into account.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>528.86</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>557.42</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>582.22</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As long as the sale of contraceptives is legal and occurs on medical prescription, nowhere other than in a pharmacy, the applicants cannot give precedence to their religious belief and impose them on others as justification for their refusal to sell such a product, since they can manifest those beliefs in many ways outside the professional sphere.</Text>

			<Text>In the context of an employer-employee relationship, the principles articulated in Pichon mean that employers cannot be forced to accommodate the religious beliefs of employees who do not wish to provide services to the public or a section of the public.</Text>

			<TimestampEnd>683.66</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I should make it quite clear that the government does not doubt that the applicant's motivation to wear a visible cross or crucifix at work was a genuine personal expression of their faith, nor is there any question of the importance of the cross as a Christian symbol.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>683.66</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>692.02</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7251.17</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7266.49</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We addressed this in our original application to the court at paragraph 54, where we identified a number of places in the United Kingdom law where provision is made for conscientious objection.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7266.51</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7300.59</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>These include the right of medical staff to conscientiously object to involvement in abortion, the right of any person to conscientiously object to participation in work involving treatment and development of human embryos outside the body, right of medical staff not to advise on or provide contraception, the exclusion of jurors from jury service on the grounds of conscientious objection, and other miscellaneous rights, including the right of Sikhs not to wear motorcycle crash helmets, which are obligatory for anyone else riding a motorcycle.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>7305.93</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7334.73</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Indeed, our submission is that the Civil Partnerships Act itself, the legislation at issue in this case, permitted conscientious objection because it did not oblige the local authorities to designate all marriage registrars as civil partnership registrars, but simply required them to ensure that they had sufficient civil partnership registrars in their area for the service of civil partnership to be provided.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>7345.13</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7366.79</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Whether or not that is the appropriate test where the allegation is of a breach of Article 9, and we would say it is not, we submit it most certainly cannot be the appropriate test where the complaint is of discrimination under Article 14, and the question is merely whether the treatment is within the ambit of Article 9.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7366.79</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7376.49</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>That is because Article 14 prohibits any detrimental treatment on prohibited grounds which is not justified.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>7391.49</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7411.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The logical implication, indeed, of the government's position is the rather startling one, that a state employer could have a policy of refusing to employ practicing Jews, and say that that was not a violation of Article 9 or Article 14 because other employers were prepared to employ them.</Text>

			<Text>We also make the point, of course, that, and this has been raised by counsel for the other applicants in this case, that in the gays and the armed forces case, the issue under Article 8 plus 14 was not resolved by the fact that those individuals could have had other careers apart from careers in the armed forces.</Text>

			<Text>It makes a difference to the question of the extent to which the local authority was under an obligation to seek to accommodate her, and to the assessment of the proportionality of the treatment to which she was subjected, because the severity of the adverse consequences of that treatment are significantly greater for an employee who has been employed for a number of years and then finds that suddenly conditions change.</Text>

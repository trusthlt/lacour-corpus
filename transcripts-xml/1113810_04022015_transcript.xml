			<TimestampBegin>302.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>314.56</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Although the present case still involves, as I said, the question of two jurisdictions, however, another different and important question came into the attention of the Grand Chamber.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>314.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>332.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This is the question of unlawfulness of the so-called tribunals acting in the region, specifically, to what extent those internationally unrecognized foundations could be or not considerate as such for the purposes of the Convention.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>346.88</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>355.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>My government's position follows the well-established case law dealing with similar problems in that breakaway region.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>355.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>363.39</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I refer to the Ilashko and Kantan cases that clarified the extent of jurisdiction in respect of both states.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>363.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>366.15</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I would briefly recall as follows.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>366.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>373.27</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Republic of Moldova has its territorial jurisdiction over the region, but it has no effective control over it.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>373.27</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>393.95</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, my government is still charged with positive obligation to do whatever possible for addressing each individual situation of a person claiming violation of the Convention rights and to pursue general measures for taking peacefully its effective control back.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>393.95</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>405.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This lack of effective control and the extent of its positive obligation disclose the degree of the responsibility of the Republic of Moldova.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>405.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>422.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Russian Federation, on the other hand, retains its jurisdictional link by virtue of its continued military presence, economic and political support for that breakaway region, which could not otherwise survive.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>422.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>439.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, the Russian Federation bears the responsibility for the whole range of the Convention violation occurring in that region on account of its overall control exerted upon the de facto administration therein.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>439.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>449.91</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Accordingly, the court has already held that both respondent states retain their jurisdiction, though in different meaning and in different quality.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>449.91</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>455.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I don't see any reason to hold otherwise in the present case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>455.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>472.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, as far as the jurisdiction is not equal to the meaning of international responsibility for a wrongful act, I will further elaborate on other issues relevant for the jurisdiction in the present case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>472.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>488.51</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Khatun case and thereafter other two cases before the Grand Chamber, Hassan and Jalot developed the jurisdiction question from a different angle, setting up the test of attribution or imputability.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>488.51</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>505.43</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I quote, the test for establishing the existence of jurisdiction has never been equated with the test for establishing the state responsibility for an internationally wrongful act under general international law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>505.43</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>511.15</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This means that lack of any form of jurisdiction engage no responsibility.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>511.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>523.71</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>While in cases where there is a jurisdictional link, the question of state responsibility becomes a separate issue examined in each individual case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>523.71</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>539.39</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This international responsibility also depends on the form of jurisdiction, be that extraterritorial, personal, overall, direct, or implicit control over the local de facto administration assuming certain public powers.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>539.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>551.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Here, the court underlines the duty of the state with jurisdictional capacity to fulfill its positive obligations, regardless of the shape of its jurisdiction.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>551.36</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>What concerns the Republic of Moldova?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>559.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>567.88</TimestampEnd>

			<Text>I add that the Republic of Moldova has fulfilled its positive obligations to the extent where they clash with the overall control and powers of the Russian government.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>606.79</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>610.31</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>610.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>630.59</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Where the Republic of Moldova territorial jurisdictions, and lack of any effective control, eventually encounter the Russian Federation denial of its responsibility and its positive obligation for overall control exerted upon the de facto local administration.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>630.59</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>642.91</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this sense, all positive obligations, be that Moldova's or Russia's, must be assessed proportionally to the level of control, in fact exercised by the both governments.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>642.91</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>651.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>On the other hand, the clash of jurisdiction could be solved by discontinuing the Russian overall control.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>651.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>661.15</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thus, the Russian government's positive obligation presupposes not a just passive inaction, but rather an active abstention.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>661.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>688.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Concluding on jurisdiction, I would like to refer to Monsieur René Casson, the very first president of the present court, who said in his Nobel Prize speech in 1968, I quote, there is no doubt concerning the essential question whether the nation have retained or lost their traditional exclusive jurisdiction over the treatment of their citizens.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>

			<TimestampBegin>715.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>729.12</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the present case, and in all similar cases, the jurisdiction and the responsibility cannot be the matter of concern only for the Republic of Moldova as an expression of its territorial jurisdiction and positive obligations.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>729.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>746.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There can be and should be an active abstention from outside overall control, allowing the Republic of Moldova to put in practice its internationally recognized right to control its own territory and to establish therein its own legal order.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>746.96</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>These factors, presence of the military servicemen, humanitarian aid, and economic support, take cumulatively in the court's view, speak in favor of the Russian control over the region, which in its turn, following the approach taken by the court, inevitably entails the responsibility of the Russian Federation for any alleged violation of the convention occurring in Transnistria.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5506.35</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>5526.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5550.07</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>5561.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5580.07</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5580.07</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5802.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5825.28</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This is about the sole question of the entire hearings which we are having here, is whether the so-called tribunals in Transnistrian region can or not guarantee fair trials and whether they afford minimum guarantees of that fair trial.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5825.28</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5864.3</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>My position of the government is clear that they cannot do this, and for this I would refer the attention of the Grand Chamber to our written submissions where we quoted, among other things, we quoted the last – the report of our last visit made by high UN official in the region who in details examined – have examined these so-called tribunals and so-called legislation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5864.3</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5875.42</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampEnd>5878.6</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5882.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5897.4</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I would add also other most important thing, that the most important guarantee of fair trial is the legality of a tribunal.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5897.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5902.18</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5902.18</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5911.38</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5912.38</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5925.78</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Because this system serves the purposes of that de facto unlawful regime, and it sustains this unlawful regime.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5925.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5938.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So the scope of such a judicial system is not a protection of human rights, but the interest of private persons within the de facto local administration.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5938.8</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5943.56</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>5955.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5979.0</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6015.88</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>That is why I would say that from this point of view, the so-called judicial system of MRT cannot follow that judicial system.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6038.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6051.28</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6051.28</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6068.6</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6068.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6093.76</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So I would say that we cannot say that the judicial system is the so-called judicial system in the Transnistrian region is at least comparable with any system in existence in the special edict of the convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6093.76</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6108.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So this is briefly replies to the question, and I would say that I would use this opportunity also to reply to the applicants' submissions and to the Russian government's pleadings.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6108.96</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>Very briefly, the Russian government continues to say that it has no responsibility because it has no jurisdiction.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6119.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6139.32</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But on the other hand, as from the pleadings of my colleague, representative of Russian Federation, we say it is clear that the Russian Federation continues to support, there is a continuous military presence.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6139.32</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6159.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So my view, and the present court view, was that the continued presence, military presence, the continued support rises a presumption of jurisdiction and the responsibility.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6159.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6167.68</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>6177.68</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6247.04</TimestampBegin>

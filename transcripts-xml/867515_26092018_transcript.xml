		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8170.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8188.52</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And our position on this is that the fence itself and the question whether a fence is built that cannot be climbed or trespassed, this is not a problem, or this is not an issue of Article 4 of Protocol.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8188.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8207.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>What we say is that jurisdiction applies, the convention applies, and then the main legal issue in that respect is whether persons, individuals who climb the fence are actively driven away.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8207.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8214.4</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I think this is the wording of the court when it comes to the definition of what qualifies for an expulsion.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8214.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8222.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So if a person climbs the fence, this is, of course, not an expulsion in the meaning of Article 4 of Protocol.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8222.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8248.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But when, like in our case and in the present case, when my clients were grabbed, were handcuffed, were forced to leave the country, when Spanish authorities opened the doors and hand them over into the violent situation in Morocco, into the hands of Moroccan officers, I think this is driven away in the sense of Article 4 of Protocol, no matter how high the fence is they climbed.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8248.44</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8263.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8285.76</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And if I understand it correctly, the question was, what is the relevance of access of Article 4 of Protocol in the context of the scenario where an asylum claim could be made?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8285.76</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8308.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And what we explained and what we said in our presentation and our speech earlier today is that, and maybe this also refers to the answer to the first question, the prohibition of collective expulsion should prevent or should allow for the possibility to make an asylum claim.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8308.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8313.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And so far, this is fixed.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8313.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8324.52</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But it also allows for other claims to be made, even for persons who don't have an asylum claim, who are not legible under the 51 Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8324.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8330.76</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And for example, maybe the most striking example are minors.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8330.76</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8340.48</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8340.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8348.4</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8348.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8353.08</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8353.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8361.08</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8432.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8454.38</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But I think we have to be clear that what the Spanish government is asking this court for is to allow for an unlawful policy by accepting the existence of lawless zones on its territory at the border, of zones where all rights, even rights under the Child Right Convention under Article 3, are denied and not accessible.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8454.38</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8462.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And such a concept, I think we can all agree on that, is completely adverse to the purpose of the convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8462.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8487.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I think we have had this impressive third-party interventions as to the importance of Article 4, Fourth Protocol, in order to allow claims to be assessed, to allow for a procedure, to allow for an identification, at least in order to be able to explain the situation and to raise arguments against an expulsion.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8487.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8508.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And by accepting the policy of summary and automatic expulsions, as we have it in the border, in the operational border protocol, which is also not mentioned for good reason by Spain, if we accept this, then we also accept arbitrariness at the border in general and also thus a refoulement.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8508.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8518.4</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Because all these rights, all the non-refoulement rights, are built on the possibility to be claimed and to be enforced before an expulsion.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>8518.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>8524.2</TimestampEnd>

			<Text>We understood four questions to be in whole or in part addressed to us, and I will attempt as briefly as possible to respond to them.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9755.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9778.34</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Firstly, the questions that were raised amongst a set of questions by Judge Stadlmayer about potential contradiction or incoherence in the statistics that I had referred to, or my statement about the limitations of people's ability to access asylum procedures.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9778.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9792.06</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Just to be entirely clear about this, a number of different sets of statistics have been presented, either in written submissions and now subsequently in our oral interventions.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9792.06</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9808.14</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And to be entirely clear, what I was referring to, and here I'm making a very clear distinction between the situation before December 2014, when indeed a border post was established at Benin-Nsar, and the situation since.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9808.14</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9811.42</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So just to be clear on that, I reiterate.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9811.42</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9830.46</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Our understanding based on statistics of the Spanish authorities indicate that 12,700 asylum seekers principally from Middle Eastern and North African countries have been registered by the Spanish authorities at Benin-Nsar border post since the end of 2014.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9830.46</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9858.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>During the same period, and we were citing this for the sake of comparison to indicate trends and the realities of the situation, as far as we are aware, approximately only 35 asylum seekers from Sub-Saharan African countries were able to be registered in the same period, and our understanding is that most of them entered the enclave by means other than through Benin-Nsar.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9858.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9889.18</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>If I just refer briefly to the data that was provided in the submission of the Kingdom of Spain with respect to the situation before August 2014, I mean, we would just note that in terms of numbers of a citation of 21 persons that were able to access some form of a procedure through the police station in Malia prior to the establishment of the Benin-Nsar border post.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9889.18</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9905.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We're speaking only of 21 cases here in the period between the 1st of the 1st 2014 and the 13th of the 8th 2014, of which only six were of Sub-Saharan African nationality.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9905.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9912.46</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So I don't think there is any discrepancy as such between the figures that have been presented.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9912.46</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9931.66</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In a second question, which we understood to be at least partially addressed to us, Judge El-Oeski asked about the reasoning behind, and as I heard it, UNHCR's rejection of the subsequent asylum claims in Spain.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9931.66</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9948.5</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>To be clear on that, I would just like to underline that we have not, in our written submissions nor in what I have said here today, we've made it very clear that we were not commenting on the merits of the subsequent asylum applications in Spain.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9948.5</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9969.9</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, since the question has been directly asked, let me just clarify that UNHCR's role within the Spanish asylum system is the provision, according to Spanish law, of a non-binding advisory opinion which takes place in the context of accelerated admissibility procedures.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9969.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>9983.82</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And this can happen at two stages, with an initial report when the claim is submitted, and subsequently in a second report which can happen 48 hours later if the case is under review.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>9983.82</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10008.7</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And we would just observe that the very nature of those type of procedures and our role in them, in our view, underlines precisely the argumentation and the reasons why we have concerns about the lack of any kind of even minimum screening procedures which took place in the context of this case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>10008.7</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10037.58</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Not everybody who claims that they have a right to asylum will necessarily ultimately receive it, but it is in our view fundamentally important to the integrity of asylum that there is an opportunity to express that need, whether it be an asylum claim or more broadly, as has been addressed by other interveners, claims to international protection which are not necessarily defined by the limited scope of asylum.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>10037.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10058.9</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We understood also that the question from Judge Harutyunen on the whole question of observation of smuggling routes, we understood that to be also partially addressed to us, basically what is UNHCR's observations on the involvement of organized smuggling towards the EU.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>10058.9</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10095.18</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I would just like to say in context that our observation overall, and this is borne out in our annual statistics on global and regional trends to do with asylum and claims for international protection, our observation in the first part is that the vast majority of persons who have been recognized as refugees or persons of concern to UNHCR, in their overwhelming majority these persons remain in regions of origin.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>10095.18</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10100.58</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So they are not the majority of people that you will necessarily find in smuggling routes.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>10100.58</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10118.3</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It has however been in our experience, and we have observed as many others have and this has been documented, the involvement of quite ruthless entities smuggling or trafficking that are involved in this business.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>10118.3</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10146.62</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And we as UNHCR have consistently in positions that we have taken around these issues pointed out that the extreme lack of alternative legal pathways is in our view one of the factors that fuels the recourse of persons in need of international protection to these quite ruthless groups that were referred to.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>10146.62</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10166.86</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And lastly, and I will finish with this, we understood that also at least in part Judge Siciliano's questions, his set of questions were directed to us in the context of asking a question about our understanding of the link between expulsion and non-refoulement.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>10166.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10183.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The question was framed in reference to the draft articles of the International Law Commission and the observations there too that non-admission or extradition considerations would not apply.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>10183.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10196.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Our understanding, and I'm looking here and quoting from Article 9 of those draft articles on the prohibition of collective expulsion where Article 9.2 says the collective expulsion</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>10196.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10218.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>of aliens is prohibited and then goes on in Subsection 3 to say that a state may expel uncommittedly the members of a group of aliens provided that the expulsion takes place after and on the basis of an assessment of the particular case of each individual member of the group in accordance with the present draft articles.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>10218.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10252.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And our understanding as UNHCR of the legitimacy of a link or the relevance of our concern about these matters, the link between expulsion and non-refoulement precisely goes to the comments we have made today about the risk of a person with a legitimate claim to international protection not being able to express that concern or avail of the protection that might attach to them if there is not in fact some minimal way of them being able to express it.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>10252.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>10281.58</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it's precisely because of our concern about the effectiveness of non-refoulement in the context of international refugee law having real content and effect that we believe that there is a need for some type of minimum at least possibility of persons to express that concern before they would be subjected to the risk of collective expulsion as was presented in the context of this case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

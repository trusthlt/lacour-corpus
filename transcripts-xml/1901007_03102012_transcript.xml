			<Text>Therefore, adoption of a child is primarily aimed at ensuring that children who are without parents or who are undesired or children from broken families or children with parents who, for serious reasons, cannot ensure the child's proper education will find a new home with suitable and responsible persons who will provide them with education and care unless there are serious reasons affecting the child's interests and the interference with the family law relations between children and their biological parents are to be avoided as far as possible.</Text>

			<Text>As the Court rightfully acknowledged in its decision in the case of Bankovic and others versus Belgium and others, should the high contracting parties to the Convention have had in mind a concept of jurisdiction without territorial limits, they could simply have used language similar to the first article of the four Geneva Conventions, which were adopted merely a year before the European Convention on Human Rights.</Text>

			<Text>Without wishing to discuss here and now each and every relevant case, I think it is safe to conclude that in all of these cases specific elements may be distinguished which, either by themselves or taken together with other such elements, may qualify as exceptional circumstances justifying the existence of extraterritorial jurisdiction, be it overall control by a respondent state over foreign territory resulting from its military presence, the status of occupying power under international law, or detention of the applicant by the respondent state on foreign territory or on the high seas.</Text>

			<Text>The second question you asked was how I would put legally the point I made about the deterrent effect or the possible deterrent effect, both on the effectiveness of UN missions and of states' willingness to participate in them.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7832.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7844.88</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And my answer to that question is, as a relevant factor or feature when analyzing the reach and proper scope of the legal concept in question, here, jurisdiction.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7844.88</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7857.76</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is, I respectfully submit, not in the least unusual for courts to consider the consequences of an expansion or, indeed, a contraction of a legal concept that they are considering.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7857.76</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7866.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>All the more so, it might be thought, if, as here, there has to be a clear focus on the intention of the framers of the convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7866.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7874.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And that was precisely the reasoning of the grand chamber in Birrami and Serramati at paragraph 149.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7874.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7882.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The grand chamber there looked directly at those consequences, not merely any consequences, but the ones I identified.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7882.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7890.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>They did so for the purpose of considering the concept of attributability, which was ultimately in issue in that case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7890.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7894.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But the legal analysis involved is precisely the same.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7894.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7898.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It doesn't turn on attributability versus jurisdiction as a concept.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7898.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7910.12</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>One is simply using the potential consequences and their seriousness as a legal guide for determining the true scope and effect of the legal concept under consideration.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7910.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7911.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So that's my answer to the second question.</Text>

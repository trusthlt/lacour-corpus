			<Text>And as the domestic courts have recently emphasized in a case involving the West Yorkshire police, their job is not to decide whether any police officer should face criminal charges or disciplinary charges, but to recommend potential charges for consideration by the CPS, or disciplinary charges for consideration by the police.</Text>

			<Text>In very brief summary, the CPS was set up in 1985 in order to take charging decisions and to conduct criminal prosecutions in a way that is robustly independent from the police and any other state agency.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>417.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>427.41</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But since then, 1985, it was considered they did not provide sufficient independence, and the CPS are designed to secure independent oversight.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>427.41</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>436.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In this case, the decision was taken by an independent Crown prosecutor on advice from independent counsel after scrutiny of the evidence.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>441.08</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>458.06</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>474.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But the complaint is that the CPS made the decision without having the power to test the oral evidence of the witnesses before taking their charging decision, or alternatively, that the decision should have been more intensively reviewed by a court.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>474.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>476.39</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>476.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>485.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>First, there's nothing in the convention to indicate that charging decisions must be taken by a court rather than an independent prosecuting body.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>485.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>494.12</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>One important feature of this case, to which I'll return, is the fact that criminal justice systems vary widely throughout the Council of Europe.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>494.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>518.15</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Recognizing that diversity of legal tradition and respecting the fact that the convention must be a living instrument for states with differing legal institutions and traditions, the court has repeatedly refrained from dictating the manner in which offenses should be investigated or prosecuted, and from dictating substantive content of criminal laws or procedures.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>518.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>527.26</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The key requirement is that decisions on prosecution are taken by an independent, impartial decision maker following a thorough analysis of the evidence.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>527.26</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>538.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>That does not dictate a particular form of procedure, and certainly does not dictate that the prosecution authorities must hear oral testimony of witnesses before taking a decision.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>538.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>547.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the United Kingdom, as in other common law jurisdictions, such decisions are taken by an independent prosecutor on review of the papers.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>547.63</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>564.91</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the case of a police killing, it must also be recalled that the CPS also have the benefit of the materials generated by the IPCC during its investigation, including transcripts of interviews that they have held with key witnesses and potential defendants.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>576.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>595.19</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The applicant argues that such reviews are not intensive enough, but as the government has explained in its observations, the courts have applied particular scrutiny to such matters, well aware of the importance of judicial review as a remedy for a potential victim whose case is not being prosecuted.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>595.19</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>604.24</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>604.24</TimestampBegin>

			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>614.19</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>623.1</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In addition, since the decision in this case, the CPS have introduced a procedure entitled the Victims' Right to Review.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>623.1</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>634.36</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>644.96</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>734.91</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>746.24</TimestampEnd>

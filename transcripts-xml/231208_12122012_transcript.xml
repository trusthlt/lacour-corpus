			<Text>Both applicants were convinced by the court of B&amp;H for having committed war crimes against civilians in 1992 and 1993, one as direct perpetrator and other as aider.</Text>

			<Text>The first applicant alleges a violation of Article 6, and both applicants allege violation of Article 7, Article 14, and Article 1 of Protocol Number 12.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>263.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>289.25</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>With regard to alleged violation of Article 6, the first applicant particularly raised the question on the principle of appointment of international judges, the duration of their terms of office, the principle of independence, exposure to internal influence, and the very perception of judicial independence.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>289.25</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>298.61</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Respondent supports the submissions by Amicus Curie as a response of delegation of the first applicant.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>298.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>330.17</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The submissions of third party highlights the period of the very beginning of comprehensive judicial reform in B&amp;H, including the creation of preconditions for transfer of case from the ICTY and generally more severe prosecution of war crimes cases on national level on grounds of the ICT experience and standards.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>330.17</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>359.13</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The presence of international judges is thus a part of the UN Security Council resolutions calling on the high representative to create a war crimes chamber in the court of B&amp;H as part of the ICTY completion strategy and calling on the donor community to provide support to that project.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>359.13</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>371.85</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thus, an engagement of international judges and prosecutors was a tool of international assistance in addition to the establishment of the international registry.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>374.69</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>398.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The engagement of judges and prosecutors from the countries with long tradition of democracy and rule of law, the practice was to hire persons who were already appointed as judges or prosecutors in the countries of their origin.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>398.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>422.45</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, it is difficult to say that the third party decisions was a substantive act of appointment of judges as it concerned judges who had undergone the election process by independent bodies in the countries of their origin.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>422.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>437.93</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This could rather be considered as an introduction of the judges into the national system as a manner of rendering the necessary assistance to the national judiciary.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>437.93</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>465.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Two years terms of office, a temporary engagement of international judges, was introduced for practical reasons, such as planning the absence from the course in their home countries, securing the donor funds for their salaries, through the registry, et cetera.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>465.37</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>481.57</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Except of the sole act of the signature of the decisions of their appointment, the high representative did not have any controlling role or influence on their work which would influence their reappointment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>481.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>498.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, these judges were considered independent and impartial in performing their functions, as confirmed by the constitutional court decision in Maktov case, which dismissed complaints on these grounds.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>498.37</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>512.73</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The respondent party notes that the courts comprising international and national judges are not specific for Bosnia-Herzegovina only, but also for Sierra Leone, Cambodia, and Kosovo.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>512.73</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>537.61</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And their ratio for their establishment was the strengthening of the judicial decision-making capacity in complex war crime cases, as well as the strengthening of the trust in courts in the post-conflict ethnically divided society.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>537.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>554.61</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The respondent particularly finds inaccurate and unfounded the applicant's allegation that the international judges were arbitrarily shifted from the first instance to second instance panels and vice versa.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>554.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>576.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The truth is that the proceedings before the court of BIAJ are managed upon the schedules periodically adopted in accordance with the two-instance system, whereby one judge can never sit on both the first instance and the second instance panel.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>576.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>598.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>With regard to allegations of violation of Article VII due to the fact that both applicants were tried and convicted under the new B&amp;H criminal code of 2003, the respondent reiterates the following.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>601.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>638.57</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>When examining applicability of substantive law and sentencing for war crimes against civilians, the court of BIAJ took into consideration both the criminal code of SFRY of 1976, which was in effect at the time of the perpetration, and the B&amp;H criminal code of 2003, in effect in time of the pronouncement of the sentence.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>638.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>651.97</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The court decided to apply the B&amp;H criminal code as more lenient law, given that it does not carry the death penalty for the given offense.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>651.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>671.61</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The respondent recalls that under the standards of the convention, the principle of legality of criminal prosecution requires that the relevant offense must constitute a criminal offense under national or international law at the time of perpetration.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>671.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>683.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>No heavier penalty can be imposed other than the one that was applicable at the time the offense was committed.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>683.37</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>693.77</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The norms must be codified in a clear manner in order to meet the requirements of foreseeability and availability.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>693.77</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>716.97</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Accordingly, from the aspect of foreseeability and availability, there is no difference between the two laws in question, as they both prescribe war crime against civilians, as well as maximum penalties for that offense within the given law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>716.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>744.85</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>When it comes to determination of the application of the relevant criminal code to the applicant's specific actions as members of armed forces, the court of B&amp;H took into account the fact that the offenses that the applicants were indicted were also prescribed in the Geneva Conventions.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>744.85</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>760.69</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The trial panel also took into account the fact that the 1976 criminal code was in effect in time when the applicant committed a war crime against civilians.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>760.69</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>773.69</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The maximum penalty prescribed by that code for this offense was the death penalty, while the minimum was five years of imprisonment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>773.69</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>804.29</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The same criminal offense, but a different social and legislative context, is codified by the B&amp;H criminal code of 2003, but it envisaged as a maximum a long time imprisonment from 20 to 45 years, and as the minimum, 10 years of imprisonment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>804.29</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>826.93</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The court of B&amp;H, therefore, properly concludes that the B&amp;H criminal code of 2003 is the only law applicable to the applicant's cases on the grounds of comparison between the maximum and minimum punishment foreseen for a specific criminal offense.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>826.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>858.09</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Constitutional Court of Bosnia-Herzegovina supported the position of the court of B&amp;H that severity of a legislation is assessed in terms of both minimum and maximum punishment foreseen, and it is, therefore, not possible to apply a minimum form from one and a maximum from another law, but only one or the other legislation, it is entirety.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>861.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>886.17</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>B&amp;H entities abolished that penalty not earlier than 1998 Federation B&amp;H and 2000 Republic Srpska, when the criminal code of SFRY was replaced by the new entity legislation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>886.17</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>901.29</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But then, was the death penalty removed from the domestic criminal legislation, thereby satisfying the state's obligation arising from the protocol number six?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>901.29</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>922.53</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In other words, prior to these dates, the law was never changed to remove the death penalty, nor to prescribe another prison sentence as a maximum penalty, in which case such law could be considered as more lenient as the applicants claim.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>922.53</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>940.29</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Besides, the transitional provisions of 2000 Criminal Code of the Republic Srpska clearly set out that the death sentence pronounced in a final court proceeding shall become a sentence of life imprisonment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>940.29</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>966.61</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This position of the respondent is strongly supported by the case law in Carmo, Vesuz, Bulgaria from January 2006, concerning the law more lenient to the perpetrator in the context of the abolishment of the death penalty and the introduction of a new law replacing this sentence by a long-term imprisonment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>966.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>995.93</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The respondent believes that the BNH Constitutional Court was resolved this issue by stating that, constitutional court holds that it's simply not possible to eliminate the more severe sanction and apply only other more lenient sanctions, so that the most serious crime would, in practice, be left inadequately sanctioned.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>995.93</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>1021.45</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is not only that the sentence of 15-year imprisonment is evidently more lenient, but it's also a different type of punishment and, as such, by its nature, it cannot be a substitute for the death penalty.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>1021.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>1035.93</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The respondent would particularly like to note that the essence and the character of the criminal offense of which the applicants were accused and punished by the law should be kept in mind.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>1035.93</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>1071.63</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The punishment of this type of criminal offenses after all short of armed conflict and changes of the ruling regime through the world Nuremberg and Tokyo trials, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the conflict in Rwanda and former Yugoslavia, was adjusted to obligation to adequately punish those responsible at the time when they were tried for such offenses.</Text>

			<Text>I'm sorry Most importantly For the success of the peace agreement and its successful implementation The parties all agreed that international organizations should be called upon and included in the peace implementation process To this end, they requested the designation of a high representative Who would be appointed consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council Resolution resolutions and whose duty would be to coordinate the activities of the organizations and agencies Involved in the civilian aspects of the peace settlement the office of the high representative OHR is an ad hoc international institution responsible for overseeing the implementation of civilian aspects of the accord Ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina The position of high representative was created under the general framework agreement for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina The high representative who is also EU special representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina Is working with the people and institution of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the international community to ensure that Bosnia-Herzegovina Evolves into peaceful and viable democracy on course for integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions For this particular case, there is one OHR decision that is extremely important It was issued on 23rd March 2007 The relevant part of the high representative's decisions reads as follows Article 2 Any step taken by any institution or authority in Bosnia-Herzegovina In order to establish any domestic mechanism to review the decisions of the high representative Issued person to his international mandate shall be considered by the high representative As an attempt to undermine the implementation of the civilian aspects of the peace agreement And shall be treated in itself as conduct undermining such implementation Article 3 Notwithstanding any contrary provision in any legislation in Bosnia-Herzegovina Any proceeding instituted before any court in Bosnia-Herzegovina Which challenges or takes issue in any way whatsoever with one or more decisions of the high representative Shall be declared inadmissible unless the high representative expressly gives his prior consent Any proceeding referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall be effectively and formally notified To the high representative by the concerned court without delay For the avoidance of any doubt or ambiguity and taking into account the totality of the matters aforesaid It is hereby specifically ordered and determined in the exercise of the said international mandate Of the high representative and person to its interpretation herein under and by virtue of the said And extent to the peace agreement that no liability is capable of being incurred on the part of the institutions Of Bosnia-Herzegovina and or any of its subdivisions and or any other authority in Bosnia-Herzegovina In respect of any loss or damage allegedly flowing either directly or indirectly From such decision of the high representative made person to his or her international mandate or at all Article 4 For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby specifically declared and provided that the provisions of the order Contained herein are as to each and every one of them laid down by the high representative person To his international mandate and are not therefore justiciable by the courts of Bosnia-Herzegovina Or its entities or elsewhere and no proceedings may be brought in respect of duties in respect thereof Before any court whatsoever at any time hereafter It is clear from paragraph 2 of the high representative's decision Any step taken by any institution or authority in Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to establish any domestic mechanism To review the decisions of the high representative issued person to his international mandate Shall be considered by the high representative as an attempt to undermine the implementation Of the civilian aspects of the peace agreement and shall be treated in itself as conduct In order to prevent such implementation that in fact there is no domestic remedy Within Bosnia-Herzegovina that would offer the applicants reasonable prospect of success For the purposes of these issues This decision was taken by high representative following constitutional court of BH Attempt to protect two citizens of BH who were removed from effectively public life by the decision of high representative It clearly states that no institution in BH including all courts cannot protect citizens of BH And their rights guaranteed under ECI chair are violated by OHR's decision It is clear that BH is responsible for this violation including applicant Maktov's right to a fair trial That was violated due to OHR's decision on appointment of international judges to short term mandates According to article 2 of annex 10 of the Dayton peace agreement The high representative is directed to monitor the implementation of the peace settlement Maintain close contact with the parties to the agreement to promote their full compliance With all civilian aspects of the agreement Coordinate the activities of the civilian organizations and agencies in Bosnia-Herzegovina To ensure the efficient implementation of the civilian aspects of the peace settlement The high representative shall respect their autonomy with their spheres of operation While it is necessary giving general guidance to them about the impact of their activities On the implementation of the peace settlement Facilitate as the high representative judges necessary The resolution of any difficulties arising in connection with civilian implementation Participate in meetings of donor organizations And report periodically on progress to the United Nations, European Union, United States, Russian Federation And other interested governments, parties and organizations It is clear that UN bond powers cannot be attributed to the United Nations And that Bosnia and Herzegovina must be held responsible for all the human rights violations Stemming from OHR's decisions When it comes to potential attribution of bond powers to the UN It is clearly explained above that this is simply impossible under international law In addition, following the successful adoption of the Dayton peace agreement in late 1995 A peace implementation conference was held in London in early December of 1995 With the purpose to mobilize, seek international support for the agreement It was at this London meeting that the peace implementation council was established The peace implementation council or PIC consists of 55 members Mostly countries and interested international organizations Of which an 11-member steering board functions as the executive arm In the instant case, the high representative intervened into the legal system of Bosnia and Herzegovina Substituting domestic authorities In that respect, he acted as an authority of Bosnia and Herzegovina And the challenge act he issued has the characteristics of a decision adopted by domestic authorities And therefore it should be deemed as a decision of the state body of Bosnia and Herzegovina A legally sustainable justification for making a difference between the actions of the high representative In the legislative normative sphere and the measures he is taking against specific individuals cannot be found Article 103 of the charter of the United Nations deals only with a subset of possible conflicts of laws in public international law Namely, conflicts between the obligations of member states of the United Nations arising under different treaties It does not attempt to determine the effect of any such conflict on the obligations of the authorities of member states Under the national constitutional or legal order The commitments of the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina And the human rights within the jurisdiction of Bosnia and Herzegovina Are clearly enumerated within the constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina While the constitution had its origin in an international treaty Annex IV to the general framework agreement for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina It has functioned for over 11 years as a national constitution The highest legal act of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina It has a dual nature It has an international aspect as one of the foundations for the existence and international recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina In the international community of states Also, it has a purely national aspect when perceived from within the country As the highest source of validity for the laws and institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina Article 2 of the constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina Guarantees to people in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina The highest level of internationally recognized human rights And provides that the European convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms Shall be applied directly in Bosnia and Herzegovina and have priority over all other law However, in the view of the applicant This does not mean that the constitutional rights of people in the territory of the state Are subject to limitations arising under public international law Pursuant to other treaties such as the charter of the United Nations The reference in article 2 of the constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina To internationally recognized human rights is not to be understood as a limitation of rights The rights under article 2 depend on the constitution and its interpretation While many of the rights are derived from those formulated in international treaties The constitutional court has drawn extensively on the case law of the European commission And the court of human rights when interpreting rights derived from the European convention So the rights themselves as given effect in Bosnia and Herzegovina Owe their authority to the constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a national constitution Not to the international treaties The constitutional source of the authority of the rights Explains why the authorities of the entities and other public institutions Which have no legal personality in public international law Are required to act in conformity with the rights as interpreted by the constitutional court And it also explains why the constitutional court is able to make final and conclusive determinations Of the scope of constitutional rights when exercising its function of upholding this constitution Under article 6 of the constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina Additionally, in the opinion on the constitutional situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina And powers of the high representative adopted at 62nd plenary session The European commission for democracy through law, Venice commission Stated as follows However, the main concern is that the high representative does not act as an independent court And that there is no possibility of appeal The high representative is not an independent judge And he has no democratic legitimacy deriving from the people of BH He pursues a political agenda agreed by the international community Which serves the best interest of the country And contributes to the realization of the council of Europe standards As a matter of principle, it seems unacceptable that decisions Directly affecting the rights of individuals taken by political body Are not subject to fair hearing or at least the minimum of due process And scrutiny by an independent court Duration of mandate, judges' independence When it comes to international judges, applicant Moktov would like to stress That he is not arguing that judges were not independent because they are internationals For lack of a better term, but because their short mandate made their independence questionable In the OHR submission, paragraph 27 It is stated that the renewable mandate of two years was due to funding restrictions In redeployments of foreign judicial officials that were subject to international donor funds This is a new reason applicant Moktov would like to add to the ones already explained in the application and following submissions The fact that short mandates of the judges were caused by insecurity of funds Adds to perception that these judges were not independent in performance of their duties As they were dependent on the satisfaction of the institutions that were appointing them, OHR, with their work It is worth mentioning that Moktov case was the first war crimes case tried by court of BH war crimes chamber It is easy to imagine that international judges, hoping that their mandate are extended Made sure that first case is a successful war crimes prosecution The second case tried is the one imposed by OHR, same institution that extension of their mandate depended on It is clear from jurisprudence of this honorable court that state organization, including financial concerns Cannot be an excuse for violation of human rights Additionally, the argument dealing with the possibility that the law on high judicial and prosecutorial counsel envisage Dealing with extending judges mandate for additional two years after the retirement age is completely beside the point In determining whether a body can be considered to independent, notably of the executive and of the parties to the case This court has had regards to manner of appointment of its members and duration of their term of office And the question whether the body presence and appearance of independence Those were judgments of this court, Lecomte, Van Leeuwen and De Mere, Pirsak judgment and Delcourt judgment In the concluding observation of the Human Rights Committee on the report submitted by Armenia under article 40 of the covenant It is stated that the committee notes that the independence of the judiciary is not fully guaranteed In particular, it observes that the election of judges by popular vote for a fixed maximum term of six years Does not ensure their independence and impartiality Similarly, in the concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee on the report submitted by Peru Under article 40 of the covenant, it is stated that the committee notes with concern that judges retire at the end of seven years And require recertification for reappointment, a practice which tends to affect the independence of the judiciary by denying security of tenure And in the concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee on the report submitted by Lithuania under the same article It is stated that with regard to article 14 of the covenant, the committee is concerned that although there are new provisions Aimed at ensuring the independence of the judiciary, district court judges must still undergo a review by the executive After five years of service in order to secure permanent appointment In this regard, the committee recommends that any such review process should be considered only with judicial competence And should be carried out only by an independent professional body In this respect, even appearances may be of a certain importance What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public and above all As far as criminal proceedings are concerned in the accused In deciding whether there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular court lacks independence or impartiality The standpoint of the accused is important without being decisive What is decisive is whether his doubts can be held to be objectively justified Article 7, prohibition of retroactivity In the letter by this court of November 21st, 2012, applicants were asked to deal with the question Whether state courts change its approach as to whether the 1976 code is more lenient than the 2003 code With regard to sentences for war crimes and if so, has the new approach led to a change of the state court's sentencing practice Applicants would like to respond that the jurisprudence of the court has not changed as such It is more a question of isolated incidents Before the cantonal courts, practice of applying more lenient code that was enforced at the time when the offense in question occurred is continuing It's a Dusko Djaic case, judgment of 3rd December, 2012 The state court did recognize that the 1976 code is more lenient in adopting these six judgments Kurtavic, Novavic, Lavovic, Ashkrabac, Mihaljevic, and Osmic However, this is not a change of jurisprudence but isolated incidents The outcome of cases often depends on the trial appeals chamber, a practice that is creating even bigger inequality among the accused In some cases, the court adopts the 1976 code, while in others it does not For example, in the Lazarev-Stretan et al. case, the court applied that provisions set forth in the 2003 code</Text>

			<Text>and found the accused guilty of the criminal offense of war crimes against civilians The court granted the defendants more lenient sentences than the code provides for 9, 7, and 5 years imprisonment It is very important to note that in these cases where the old code was applied, it was all done so by the appeals chamber To this date, there has not been one judgment applying the old code before trial chambers even when sentences are below the prescribed minimum in the new code For example, in the Terzi-Chalbina case, the accused was found guilty of the criminal offense of war crimes against civilians under the new code and was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment In the Selmanovic-Mehura et al. case, two of the accused were found guilty of the criminal offense of war crimes against civilians</Text>

			<Text>under the new code and was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment The other defendant was acquitted The prohibition of retrospective application of law is a well-established principle in the realms of both domestic and international law Article 7 of the Convention embodies precisely this principle Before we go into more detail and deal with OHR submission, we would like to stress out that applicant's cases are not the cases where conduct in question was not prescribed by the code that was enforced at the time when the alleged offense occurred This seems to be the gist of both OHR submission and BHI submissions of October 15, 2012 Actions for which both of the applicants were found guilty were prescribed in the code that was enforced at the time when this alleged offense occurred These are not cases dealing with exceptions as provided in Article 7, paragraph 2 These are the cases that exclusively deal with Article 7, paragraph 1 Applying the harsher penalty retrospectively in this case is a violation of Article 7, paragraph 1 and further there is no logical reason to do so The Office of the High Representative argues that the 2003 criminal code should be applied retroactively to the accused in this case and that the retrospective changes to the law are permissible so long as they could be reasonably predicted The OHR cites SW v. United Kingdom and the German reunification cases in support of its argument</Text>

			<Text>The Court held that removal of the marital immunity exception to rape by common law development was foreseeable and therefore did not violate Article 7 The Court held that the domestic courts continued a perceptible line of case law development, dismantling the immunity It was foreseeable because of the nature of common law development The law evolved through a line of case law over the course of several years to reflect society's changing attitudes This is clearly different from the enactment of new legislation that prescribes a heavier penalty in relation to the accused than did the old legislation It was not a change that happened gradually due to a more progressive thinking society It was a measure that was put into place to give a harsher punishment to the perpetrators of crimes The German reunification cases are also distinguishable from the present case The retrospective application of laws in those cases were done in order to ensure impunity for perpetrators of war crimes would not arise That is clearly not an issue in the present case, as the applicants have been convicted of a criminal offense that was prescribed in the criminal code that was enforced at the time when the offenses were committed In addition, both applicants have dealt extensively with arguments and reasons why the exception to Article 7, Paragraph 1 as prescribed in Article 7, Paragraph 2 does not apply in their cases This exception applies in cases where the criminal offense was not prescribed in the law at all, which is not the issue in the present cases Also, the argument that the application of the 1976 Criminal Code or 1998 FBH Criminal Code does not require any more direct application of international law insofar as the Criminal Code of BH contains the same shortcomings, which is true for most codes dealing with war crimes An example would be the ICTY Statute Article 3 Article 142 of the FRI CC provides similar lines and Article 173 of the new Criminal Code of BH the same However, in violation of rules of international law in the time of war, armed conflict or occupation Clearly, this argument from OHR's submission is completely wrong Paragraph 43 of the OHR's submission is clearly legally wrong as it stated that a sentence of imprisonment for several months as punishment for a crime of genocide could be possible According to the Criminal Code that was enforced when the applicants committed offenses of which they were found guilty, the prescribed minimum sentence is 5 years in prison That can be, under special circumstances, mitigated to 1 year Of course, this argument is completely hypothetical as it is impossible to envisage all of the possible cases It is important to stress that OHR did not deal with this Court's jurisprudence in Scoppola at all States cannot change their laws after an event in order to punish perpetrators This would not only be contrary to modern legal norms, it would be fundamentally unjust No matter how controversial the crime, a state must follow the laws that are in place at the time In Norway v. Breivik, the defendant received a punishment that has been widely criticized as being too lenient</Text>

			<Text>However, Norway had to follow their penal code as it was at the time of the crime In Breivik, the defendant killed 8 people and injured 9 when he detonated a car bomb in the government district in Oslo He further killed 69 people and injured 33 who were mostly youths attending a summer camp in a shooting rampage at Utøya Island The Court found that there was no doubt that the acts were done with premeditation and under especially aggravating circumstances The defendant was sentenced to preventive detention for a term of 21 years, the maximum sentence allowed under the Norwegian penal code Despite worldwide criticism that his punishment is much too lenient These are concluding remarks There are different estimates of the number of pending war crimes cases in Bosnia and Herzegovina Should the more lenient law or the law that was enforced at the time when these offenses were being committed be more universally applied It would in all probability be a significant tool to more efficiently process these cases The minimum prescribed sentence is 5 years that can be further mitigated to 1 year under specially mitigated circumstances This means that a significant number of low-level suspects would be inclined to accept plea bargains and cost of expensive trials would be avoided All the while victims of war crimes would be satisfied because the perpetrators of crimes were punished An accused party's access to fundamental fair trial rights is a key indicator of equitability in any system of criminal justice As proceedings lose their credibility and integrity without the consistent application of due process standards It would, in the applicant's view, be detrimental not only to the Court of BH But also to the future development of international criminal law and human rights law if it was allowed to give the appearance of inventive penalties for crimes Thus highly politicizing its function, especially in cases such as the applicants Where the alleged conduct in question was without any doubt penalized at the time when it took place Justice must not only be done but also seen to be done by the people as the addresses of all judicial decisions Based on the foregoing reasons, the applicants respectfully request this Court to judge and declare That there has been a violation of Article 6 of the Convention because applicant Mokhtov's rights to a fair trial was violated That there has been a violation of Article 7 of the Convention because applicant Demyanovich and applicant Mokhtov's rights to a non-retractive application of criminal law was violated That there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention because both applicants' right of non-discrimination was violated That Bosnia and Herzegovina is liable for these breaches and must pay adequate compensation to the applicants in this respect as provided by Article 41 of the Convention That the expenses incurred by the applicants to have their rights recognized and enforced legal fees must be paid by Bosnia and Herzegovina Thank you Your Honor.</Text>

			<Text>In response to government's oral submission, we would like to stress that opinion of appeals chambers of court of BH in Kurtović, Lalović, Mihaljević, Navalić, Aškraba, and the Osmić case is completely in line with Antonio Cassez's opinion on application of the law in BH and the reason for when its commission is quoted in applicant Demyanović's original application.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4610.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4624.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Regarding the death sentence, the court of BH appeals chambers' reliance upon the generic assertion that the death penalty was enforced at the time of the commission of the offense under the SFRAI-CSE is misleading.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4624.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4643.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The court should have noted that as from the date of the general framework agreement on 14 December 1995 and the introduction of the BH constitution on the same date, Bosnia and Herzegovina was bound by the ECHR and the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4643.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4659.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Personal to Article 2 of the second protocol, no reservation to the abolition of the death penalty is admissible except for a reservation that provides for the application of the death penalty in time of war pursuant to conviction for a most serious crime of military nature committed during war time.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4659.44</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>Therefore, as from 14 December 1995, the application of death penalty was permissible only in time of war.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>4668.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4678.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>According to a decision of the BH Human Rights Chamber in 1998, the word application covers both the imposition and the execution of the death penalty.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4678.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4689.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Therefore, the court held that the effect of the second protocol is to impose an absolute prohibition without the possibility of any reservation or exception or execution of the death penalty in time of peace.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4689.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4703.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The court reasoned that since no state of war now exists in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the execution of death penalty would not be compatible with either the second protocol or protocol number 6 of the ECHR.</Text>

			<Text>Firstly, we doubt the objectivity of the conclusions of the report.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3123.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3137.51</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The report was drawn up on the basis of information provided by the applicant and her children, and it is likely that the information given to Professor Kalverboer was influenced by their wish to remain in the Netherlands.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3137.51</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>3147.23</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3155.91</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3175.51</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And this surprises us, since documents submitted by the applicant earlier in the proceedings emphasize how well the children are doing and how well they are faring and their development is going well in spite of the situation and the uncertainty surrounding the applicant's residence permit.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>3179.43</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3190.35</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3228.11</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3232.99</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3239.47</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3239.47</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3247.11</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3247.11</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3255.87</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3255.87</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3268.39</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3268.39</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3279.55</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Fourthly, it is unclear on what grounds Professor Kalverboer bases her conclusion that the applicant would struggle to support herself and her children in Suriname.</Text>

			<Language>en</Language>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3310.15</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>3328.99</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3343.23</TimestampEnd>

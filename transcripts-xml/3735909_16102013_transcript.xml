			<Text>Therefore, entering a new gender before the person has obtained a new personal identity code and following the legal gender recognition would result in two deconflicting gender entries in the passport, as I said before.</Text>

			<Text>I would like to ask you, as regards to the question of Article 14 by Judge Lemons, whether the two situations are similar or different.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>5536.87</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5554.91</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government reiterates its view that cisgender individuals are not in a similar situation as the applicant, as they are not applying for this legal confirmation of a changed gender, which is only applicable to transgender persons.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5554.91</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5569.83</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And the government also recalls that a registered partnership would provide the same legal protection to the applicant and her family currently enjoined by them, taking into account the circumstances of the present case.</Text>

			<Text>And concerning still the travel card, there are various cards.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5579.71</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5589.71</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>There are, let's say, playing cards, and anybody can use such, and then personal cards.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5589.71</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5597.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And personal cards are usually used by those persons who go to work all the time or something like that.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5597.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5600.79</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampEnd>5631.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>A personal card includes information on its holder, and it's for the reason, of course, that if somebody, if this kind of card has been stolen from somebody and there is a different sex person, for instance, having these cards in a tram, for instance, of course the inspector has to ask what is the situation and these cases might happen.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5631.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5643.15</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But the inspectors, these inspections, they are indeed occasional and a couple of times per year, perhaps, you might see them.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>5643.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5647.79</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5647.79</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5659.03</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And as regards the inspectors, they are trained to various situations, for instance, these kind of situations.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5659.03</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5667.47</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And they try to handle the situation with all delicacy it requires.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>5667.47</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5710.91</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And as regards the applicant's reference to federal constitutional court and its judgment, and that has also been in your observations, the government notes that according to that judgment, the government notes that according to that judgment, a married transgender person could not, according to German law at the time, obtain legal gender recognition without getting divorced, resulting in the termination of all legal safeguards of their marriage.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5710.91</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5729.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, that court came to the conclusion that it is left to the legislator to ensure that the community of responsibility between a married transsexual or his or her spouse can continue and not to be terminated.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5729.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5747.43</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And the constitutional court said that as such, the legislature could provide for the conversion of the marriage into a registered partnership, effectively from the date of legal recognition of the gender status of the transsexual spouse.</Text>

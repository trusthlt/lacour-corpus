			<Text>Can I turn then to Judge Guerra and the question he posed with regard to the fourth applicant.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7562.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7569.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it is correct to say that no caution was given in the case of the fourth applicant.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7569.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7572.52</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But the factual matrix was different in the case of the fourth applicant.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7572.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7580.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The fourth applicant was invited in to give a statement as a witness and did give a statement as a witness.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7580.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7589.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>During the course of that statement, the police became concerned that he was or was about to, in some sense, incriminate himself.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7589.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7599.56</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And then a decision was given pursuant to the situation on the ground and the need for further intelligence that a caution would not be administered.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7599.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7608.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And there were compelling reasons for that, as was found by the court at first instance, acknowledged by the Court of Appeal, and found by the chamber.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7608.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7619.76</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And at the end of the day, it is also to be noted that the fourth applicant, once he had legal advice, adopted the statement he'd already given.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7619.76</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7623.56</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Albeit he made one or two corrections, he adopted that statement.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7623.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7627.4</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And indeed, his position remained that he had given such a statement.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7627.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7633.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And he ultimately relied upon that in the context of mitigation and sentence.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7633.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7636.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So again, it is a fact-sensitive exercise.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>7636.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7637.72</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7637.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7646.32</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But in the first instance, there was no grounds for giving a caution to the fourth applicant, because he began his interview with the police as a witness.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7646.32</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7652.64</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7652.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7672.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And as I observed earlier in the context of the question from Judge Spano, although there should have been a contemporary record of why the caution was not given, in the event, the police officers who were engaged in that process did give evidence in the voir dire and were cross-examined about the circumstances.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7678.76</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7682.28</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>One final point.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7682.28</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7695.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>My learned friends suggested that the fourth section, the chamber, had somehow proceeded upon the basis that breaches of Article 6 did not matter, because there were compelling reasons.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7695.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7699.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>That, in my respectful submission, was not the reasoning of the chamber.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7699.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7707.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The reasoning of the chamber was that there were no breaches of Article 6, having regard to the whole circumstances that pertained.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>7707.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>7709.6</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>7709.6</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>I again invite this court to find that there were no breaches of Article 6.</Text>

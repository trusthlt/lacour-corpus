		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3825.71</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3841.81</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government, in the observations and also today, refers to the separate area reserved by the police for the media, which was on the square opposite to Kiasma Museum on the other side of the street.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3841.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3857.75</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, it can be seen from the photos and from the video film that when the situation turned violent, visibility from that area to the scene was blocked by the police cordon, police cabs, and buses.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3857.75</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3869.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And my question is, was this area really useful for the journalists to cover the event on the spot when it turned violent?</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3869.67</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3891.03</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3910.79</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Since according to the Police Act, a person could not be kept apprehended for more than 12 hours, and the longer apprehension time, up to 24 hours by the Criminal Investigation Act, would have been applicable only if arrest was available.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3910.79</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3921.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And the applicant was charged and convicted of disobeying police order, and the statutory sanction of that would not have allowed arrest.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3921.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3939.83</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Now, I understood from the submission of the government that the government's allegation is that the applicant was apprehended of rioting, and it was only later changed to disobeying police orders.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3939.83</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3951.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, according to the Ombudsman, a bystander who did not take part in violent actions as the applicant could not be apprehended of rioting.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3951.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3958.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And therefore, the longer apprehension time, this 24 hours, seems to be excluded.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3958.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>3972.23</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And my question now is, since the legal basis for the apprehension for 12 hours, it's clear, but the question concerns the legal basis for the rest 5.5 hours.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3972.23</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3976.51</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3987.69</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4003.43</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4003.43</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5505.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5530.07</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Of course, when the riot or demonstration became violent, the police has to act in a certain way, and then there were buses, which of course restricted the visibility from that separate area to the place where the demonstrators were, and the demonstration event took place.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5530.07</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>5538.07</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5551.31</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5551.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5579.03</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But anyway, it's true, it certainly was a good idea to have a demonstration, and I think that the applicant had the choice to be somewhere else, all the journalists could be somewhere else, and the applicant was very near to the demonstrators, and now his visibility was not hindered in any way.</Text>

			<Text>As regards the question of whether there was a demonstration or demonstrators, or whether it was a crowd, first there was a demonstration, but quite soon, police ordered it to be ended, and that was not peaceful anymore, there was no demonstration anymore, and then of course you can just see that there was a crowd.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5613.15</TimestampBegin>

			<TimestampBegin>5755.64</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>5774.64</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>The Coercive Measures Act requires that in order to have the possibility to apprehend for maximum 24 hours, there has to be prerequisites for arrest at present.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5791.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5799.34</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5799.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5812.34</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Firstly, the applicant was apprehended on the basis of rioting, and the maximum punishment is one year imprisonment for rioting.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5812.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5819.54</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5819.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5825.24</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5825.24</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5846.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And secondly, persons who were suspected of rioting would have probably continued with the criminal activity rioting later on, and this fulfills subsection c requirement.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5846.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5861.64</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I mean in the Coercive Measures Act, the requirement of the intention of continuing criminal activity.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5861.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5874.14</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But I also like to emphasize the importance of second paragraph of section three, which came up in government's address today.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5874.14</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5885.34</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5885.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5893.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>When there is a cause to suspect a person of an offense, he may be arrested even though there is not probable cause.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5893.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5902.14</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Not probable cause for the suspicion, but the other prerequisites for arrest stipulated in paragraph one exist.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5902.14</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5910.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And the taking of the suspect into custody is very important because of expected further clarification.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5910.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5917.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So in this particular case, it was important to have further clarification on the matter.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5917.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5937.94</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And as the subsection which I quoted says, it isn't obligatory to have a cause, probable cause to suspect, but cause to suspect is enough.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5937.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5950.54</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I also like to emphasize that usually the prerequisites of arrest, they clarify later on when the investigation goes on.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5950.54</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5954.94</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5954.94</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5965.54</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5973.74</TimestampBegin>

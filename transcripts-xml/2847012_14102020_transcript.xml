		<Snippet>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>3971.6</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>3987.52</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4033.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So first of all it has to be mentioned that the right to broadcast in this case must be subjected to legal regulations and the government remind and recall including to the applicant that it had been sanctioned about 20 times for various reasons and each time the council decided to apply milder sanctions even if the very first time it could have been a public warning and the second could have been a pecuniary fine, the third could have been a suspension for 5, 3, 30 days and so on but and then the fifth one could have been the withdrawal of the license.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4033.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4057.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However the government want to stress that these 18 sanctions could have probably been just 5 or 6 before the withdrawal of the license but the government and the authorities decided to sanction the applicant company about 18 times before withdrawing that license for only that period of time.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4057.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4068.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government want to stress that the applicant company could reapply for a license within 12 months after the withdrawal of the license.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4068.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4086.92</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In the government's opinion that period of time could have been used for the applicant or for any other company sanctioned with that to reset its policy and to rethink its strategies in order to comply with the regulations.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4086.92</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4098.4</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The government want to reiterate and to stress to highlight that the main goal of the authorities was not to withdraw anyone's license, broadcasting license.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4098.4</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4118.86</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>They just wanted to apply sanctions gradually and formally just to reset and to determine any applicant including the other applicants to re-enter the legal specifics of the norm, just to re-enter legality.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4118.86</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4138.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So that is why the authority applied several milder sanctions as I said about 18 sanctions although it could have applied just 3 or 4 and then withdrawn the license immediately.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4138.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4156.7</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>To answer Judge O'Leary's question about the 15 days, the 15 working days, that period of time was expressly provided by the legislation for the audiovisual council.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4156.7</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4177.66</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is a period, it is a maximum period within which the council had to examine any wrongdoing or any action by a broadcaster and it basically was not for the applicants to be informed or to be granted time to respond.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4177.66</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4233.3</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Also the government submitted in their observations explicit information about the broadcasters that had been sanctioned during that period of time and we reiterate it was not just the applicant company, it was also the public broadcaster and other private broadcasters for various shortcomings, for various violations and I reiterate the main difference between the applicant and the other one sanctioned was that the other ones did comply with those sanctions and they did re-enter legality whereas the applicant just chose to disregard any of those sanctions and just continued the same editorial policy and the same lack of pluralism either internal or external.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4233.3</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4245.98</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So just to answer the question, it was not just the applicant, it was about many broadcasters and that information is in the government's submissions.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4245.98</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4260.38</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And about the question on the way the audiovisual council decides on when and how to unfold the monitoring, it could be done in different ways.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4260.38</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4282.22</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Basically it is as a result of notifications of individuals or legal persons but it is also made ex officio especially in the electoral periods of time, it means prior to the elections when they occur.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4282.22</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4329.78</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Concerning judges Barton and Pavley's questions about article 3810 and 388 of that law, the code, well, it was changed after the revocation, after the withdrawal of this license and we don't really see any connection with this case since it occurred later on but in any way the constitutional court mentioned about the fact that it didn't need to pronounce itself on the abstract proportionality of the sanction because it basically referred itself to the lack of procedural guarantees of that provision.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4329.78</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4347.34</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So in fact, the constitutional court did not examine the very merits of the case limiting itself to some procedural lack of procedural guarantees.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4347.34</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4383.06</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And referring to judges Pavley's question about the recommendation concerning the two thirds of the members of parliament for electing the members of the audiovisual council, the government would like to mention or to know that whenever we had the presidential republic, I mean when the president was elected by the parliament itself, it was very complicated to achieve two thirds of the members of parliament or the majority of two thirds in this case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4383.06</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4410.02</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So therefore, it was basically renounced to apply the two thirds and it was opted for the simple majority of the members of parliament even simply because in the political reality of the republic of Moldova that might have been even impossible, not to say very complicated.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4410.02</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4449.42</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Concerning that same notification of the judgment of the constitutional court, it should be noted that the constitutional court was notified by a member of parliament and therefore, all the ethics of that constitutional court's judgment could not be applied for the past but only for the future in this case.</Text>

			<Text>In fact, the government cited the international reports selectively, referred to the information provided by Kyrgyzstan itself instead of independent observers, or made statements not supported by any statistics at all.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>314.0</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>343.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The Russian authorities referred to the public statement of Amnesty International made in 2020, which, I quote, welcomed Kyrgyzstan's cooperation with the Universal Periodic Review and its acceptance of 193 out of 232 recommendations, including recommendations on eradicating torture and ill-treatment.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>351.28</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>365.12</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I quote, we regret that recommendations to set up an independent body to investigate torture and other ill-treatment were merely noted.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>365.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>396.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Finally we urge the Kyrgyzstan authorities to follow through with the implementation of recommendations from the previous cycle of its UPR to carry out full and impartial investigations into human rights violations that occurred during the June 2010 ethnic violence, with special attention to allegations made by members of the Uzbek minority.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>396.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>427.0</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And in its report for the cycle of the UPR of 2020, Amnesty International expressed its disappointment that, I quote, Kyrgyzstan rejected recommendations to adapt recruitment guidelines for the police and the security forces to increase the representation of ethnic minorities and to adopt comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>427.0</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>Moving further, the government largely relied on the reports of the working group on the UPR for Kyrgyzstan of 2015 and 2020.</Text>

		<Snippet>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>464.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>471.88</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>All the extracts cited were derived not from the conclusions of any independent observers.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>481.12</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>492.48</TimestampBegin>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>501.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>508.64</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>508.64</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>514.72</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>538.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>551.28</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Further, the government brought the attention to the establishment of a special monitoring center in 2014 aimed at preventing the recurrence of the ethnic conflict.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>551.28</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>571.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, the only achievement of this center in the last six years, which the government was able to find, is, I quote, working on a digital map of sites of potential ethnic conflicts.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>571.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>580.56</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>580.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>590.28</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>For instance, the government sought to prove the effectiveness of the national preventive mechanism created in Kyrgyzstan in 2012.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>590.28</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>639.28</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>676.28</TimestampBegin>

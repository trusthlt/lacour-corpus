			<Text>Ma deuxième question est relative à la façon dont les deux parties voient le rapport entre l'article 9 de la convention et l'article 2 du protocole 1 parce qu'il me semble que la récurrente avait fait des propos par rapport à la cour de trouver une violation de l'article 9 en relation avec cet article 2 tandis que le gouvernement nous a dit que l'article 9 sans doute il est plus large. Donc quelle sera la préférence du gouvernement et de la récurrente par rapport au rapport entre ces deux articles? Merci beaucoup.</Text>

			<Text>In your memorial, you relied heavily on the case of Tenenbaum versus Sweden, that concerned decision by the Swedish authorities to place their daughters in a Protestant foster family rather than a Jewish one, although they were Jewish, in which the commission stressed on the principles that the authorities were obliged to take into consideration the applicants' wish to have their children be placed in Jewish foster home.</Text>

			<TimestampBegin>4615.85</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4640.25</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>However, in the Tenenbaum, the commission declared this complaint inadmissible because, I quote, the social authorities explored the possibilities of placing the children in a Jewish foster home, but their endeavors failed because of the other considerations, such as the difficulty to find, without any unnecessary waste of time, relevant home not far from the parents.</Text>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4915.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4953.24</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Because relating to revision of the judgment delivered by the chamber in the present case and revision of a found violation of Article 8, the government's agent stated that the national courts had done a very good assessment of the measures that were made towards the reunification of the applicant and her child, and that the domestic authorities had done everything that they could to reunify the child with the applicant.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4981.32</TimestampBegin>

			<Text>However, the national authorities stated that the improved ability to self-care did not signify that the applicant's ability to care for her child had improved, and that they were, and then they didn't go into any specific assessment relating to that point, because the domestic authorities simply dismissed it as not relevant to the case.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>5787.17</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5790.17</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Apologies for that. That was my mistake entirely.</Text>

			<Text>I will confine my intervention now to responding to the questions of the judges.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5801.33</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5821.93</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I start with the question from Mr. Bårdsen, which I take as a question asking whether the government understands the seriousness of the court's scrutiny of child welfare practice in Norway, essentially.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5822.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5857.17</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And let me explain that the reason why the government insists and keeping on insisting that the Strandlobben principles should be reaffirmed is not out of consideration of what the consequences of those views are, but out of consideration that we are afraid that other forces, and I'm referring to individual applicants and third party intervenors, wish to make amendments to the Strandlobben principles.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5857.17</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5880.73</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So the concern from the government side is that out of consideration of the principle of foreseeability, the government obviously implements the practice of the court and is doing its utmost to do that, but also out of consideration for the rights of the child.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5881.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5896.41</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And naturally we understand that the Strandlobben principles in their application necessarily involves some kind of substantive amendments to be made in domestic practice.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5896.41</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5903.41</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And this the court, sorry, this the government has stated in the action plan submitted to the committee of ministers.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5903.41</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5931.85</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This the Supreme Court has said in its judgments and the government is preparing and is implementing several forms of capacity building measures, training, et cetera, to make all efforts to ensure that these principles are followed also in the sense that they have substantive consequences.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5931.85</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5948.25</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The other question from Judge Bårdsen was, I think, whether it is possible to reach the conclusion in this case that article, that the convention is not violated in the present case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5948.25</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5971.33</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And my government believes in all seriousness that yes, that is a possibility if one considers the very broad assessment made by domestic authorities and the very solid evidentiary and research-based material that decisions are based on.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5971.33</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6006.77</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As to the question from Judge Pastor Vilanova, if I understand correctly, what is the sense of insisting before the court today, the grand chamber, that we can reconsider article eight of the convention having regard to the fact that Norway accepted the judgment on the chamber level?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6006.77</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6010.85</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And I believe there are two answers to this.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6010.85</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6024.45</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>First of all, the government builds on the assumption that when a case is referred to the grand chamber, there is a renewed consideration of the whole case as such.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6024.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6027.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And that is one reason why.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6027.37</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6041.61</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The other reason is that the questions to the parties that were submitted by the court in July specifically asked whether article eight was violated as well.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6041.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6055.13</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So, this is also one reason why we have considered article eight anew before the grand chamber.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6055.13</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6089.09</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As to the question by Judge O’Leary, if there is any possible exhaustion problems if we consider this case from the angle of article two or protocol one, for instance, I would say that there might be some exhaustion problems, but that really depends on how the grand chamber approaches article two or protocol one or article nine.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6089.09</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6119.69</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Because in the government's understanding of the court's practice, the facts of the case will govern whether the facts of the case and the reasoned view of the applicant that have been relied upon in domestic courts will govern the court's possibility to have regard to other provisions regardless of the exhaustion problem.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6119.69</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6127.77</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So it really comes down to what kind of facts the grand chamber will build its approach on.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6127.77</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6136.53</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In that respect, I refer to paragraph one, two, five of the government's memorial.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6136.53</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6169.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As to the question by Judge Lemmens, if there is a duty under the convention to avoid particular groups of foster families in a case such as the present, I believe that the correct answer there must be that, of course, the states must have due regard to many aspects of foster parents and the selection of foster parents.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6169.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6181.01</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And this is also reflected in the domestic law provisions that are referred to in the memorial.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6181.01</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6194.55</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But due regard to all those considerations also have to have regard to the child's needs, and the child's needs will be in the forefront.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6194.55</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6201.23</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I move to the questions posed by Judge Mortoc.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6201.23</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6209.57</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We were asked to repeat the attempts that were made to find a Muslim foster home for the boy.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6209.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6215.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And this is spelled out in detail in section 2.6 in the government's memorial.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6215.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6232.49</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And just to respond to the applicant's counsel, she stated that these pieces of information about the search for other alternative Muslim foster homes were new to them.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6232.49</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6242.13</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>With all due respect, I think that the applicant's counsel were not present in all domestic proceedings in this case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6242.13</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6252.77</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It would be obvious that this has been touched upon in witness statements in the domestic court proceedings at some level.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6252.77</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6265.47</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And we have tried to assemble all information that we could get about this, and it has been restated in the memorial.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6265.47</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6272.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As to the second question by Judge Mortoc, does the government or did the government try to find a secular foster home?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6272.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6280.57</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And the answer to that is that we have no information that they actually did try to find a secular foster home.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6280.57</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6302.83</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>What the municipality and the child welfare service in the municipality did was to look for an experienced foster home that could, at a very short time, accommodate the extraordinary needs of this particular child.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6302.83</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6306.45</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>They had been trained in being foster parents.</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>6306.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6310.85</TimestampEnd>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6310.85</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6325.41</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it will also be shown in the memorial that they had due regard to the boy's religious in these first years of his life.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6325.41</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6335.45</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>They were also in the same city as the applicant in order to make it easier for contact sessions to be implemented.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6335.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6344.85</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And finally, the third question by Judge Mortoc, the relationship between Article 9 and Article 2 or Protocol 1.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6344.85</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6352.89</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I will just say that this is stated in the government's memorial in Section 5.2.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6352.89</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6388.33</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And more precisely, if I am permitted, I will just say that in paragraph 131, we state that the principles that thus far have been developed under Article 2 or Protocol 1 are not well suited to address the issues of the present case because, in the government's view, the balancing of interest is primarily directed in the form of educational institutions.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6388.33</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6393.09</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And a foster home is not an educational institution.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6393.09</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6401.97</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>6401.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>6406.93</TimestampEnd>

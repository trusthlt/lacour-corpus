			<Text>In Vinter, the judgment of this court did not take the law in any new direction or impose a new obligation on the contracting states.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>266.05</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>274.49</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The court instead took up the principles already established in previous judgments, notably in Kafkaris and Cyprus.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>274.49</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>287.41</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>That judgment was founded on a wealth of international jurisprudence described in that judgment and described in our written submissions, which I will not repeat and take up the court's valuable time.</Text>

		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>287.41</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>304.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In Vinter, this court stressed that to avoid offending Article 3, a whole life order has to be reducible both in theory and, of course, in practice, de jure and de facto.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>304.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>316.81</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It's our submission that in this case, the government of the United Kingdom advances the same argument on de jure as was rejected rightly by this court in Vinter.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>316.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>325.81</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And with granted, de facto, there is, with great respect, simply a deafening silence from the government of the United Kingdom.</Text>

			<TimestampEnd>330.55</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In our submissions this morning, we would like to address three subjects.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>330.55</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>346.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>First, why the United Kingdom is still in violation of Article 3 on the theoretical de jure analysis of the system in place, and therefore, why the English Court of Appeals judgment in McLaughlin simply does not deal with that problem.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>346.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>357.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Second, why on a practical basis, the United Kingdom has done nothing to change its practice so as to abide by this court's judgment in Vinter.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>357.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>379.41</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thirdly, and finally, why, with great respect, that even if there are delicacies or tensions in the relationship between this court and the United Kingdom, the court should nonetheless, unhesitatingly, declare a continuing violation in this application.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>379.41</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>383.21</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>To start, if I may, with our submissions on de jure.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>383.21</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>385.91</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The system in theory.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>385.91</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>394.95</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>To remind the court, with respect, of the three qualities that a convention-compliant system requires as described in Vinter.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>394.95</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>402.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>First, there must be a review mechanism in place not limited to compassionate grounds.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>402.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>408.61</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Second, the prisoner must be told when the review will take place.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>408.61</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>421.05</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Third, the prisoner must be told what he must do to have a prospect of release, and the criteria that the review will apply when considering release.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>421.05</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>453.15</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The limitation, the first of those problems, the limitation of the review mechanism to compassionate grounds is, we would submit, the one required quality which the Court of Appeal in McLaughlin did at least engage with, holding, as the court will have read, that the Prison Service Order was legally far outweighed by the terms of the statute, the Crime Sentences Act, and the obligation under the United Kingdom's Human Rights Act for the minister to act compatibly with the Convention.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>453.15</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>469.75</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Yet, the only basis to release a whole-life order prisoner in the statute remains upon, quote, compassionate grounds, which the Court of Appeal in McLaughlin said must be given, quote, a wide meaning.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>469.75</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>487.01</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We remind the court, with gratitude, of the words of Judge Pinto de Albuquerque, in his opinion concurring on this point in the second Otchelan judgment, and I quote his honor on the McLaughlin judgment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>487.01</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>493.41</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>This opinion raises rather serious linguistic, logical, and legal questions.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>493.41</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>508.81</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>What does compassion have to do with risk assessment, the prospect of the offender's resocialization, or the lack of a continuing penological grounds for continued imprisonment?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>508.81</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>518.45</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Is the wide meaning of compassionate grounds so wide it has no connection with the plain meaning of the word compassion?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>518.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>532.45</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>What can be more unpredictable than a discretionary legal provision to release in exceptional circumstances, which is converted into an obligation to release with a, quote, wide meaning, unquote?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>532.45</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>540.65</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>What can be more unclear than, quote, exceptional grounds with a wide meaning?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>540.65</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>561.41</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It's our submission that the time has now been reached when this court can, in fact, go beyond, with great respect, the judgment in Kafkaris and Vinter, and say there is now an international consensus that decisions about prisoners' release should be taken by courts, by judges, not by politicians.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>561.41</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>570.21</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Our basis for that argument is set out in great detail in our written submissions, and I will not take up this court's time by reading them out.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>570.21</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>573.95</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But simply to add one or two points to that.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>573.95</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>588.95</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Firstly, we say it is of note that the sole direction of travel, the sole direction of development in United Kingdom sentencing policy has been away from the politicians, into the hands of judges.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>588.95</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>604.71</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Second, we acknowledge at once that in Kafkaris and Cyprus, and indeed subsequently, this court has found no violation of Article 3 in a system that is based upon application to a politician.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>604.71</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>620.67</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But in Kafkaris, of course, the politician in question was the president in a contracting state, where that post, though under the Cypriot scheme an elected post, might perhaps suggest a politician with no further ambition for promotion.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>620.67</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>622.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>He's the president, after all.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>622.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>629.31</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Thus, perhaps to a degree, above the rough and tumble of politics more normally.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>629.31</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>634.87</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And of course, I come forward to de facto, which I will come to in but a few minutes time.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>634.87</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>650.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Of course, above all in Kafkaris, this court had the comfort of knowing that numerous prisoners had been released from supposedly whole life orders over many years before the court's judgment in that case.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>650.37</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>653.01</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The United Kingdom, of course, has no presidential system.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>653.01</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>658.29</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We have no politician removed above from the daily rough and tumble of politics.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>658.29</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>664.49</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And of course, there's no such de facto comfort as we'll come to in a few minutes times.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>664.49</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>701.97</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We also on this point finally note in this concurring opinion in this court's decision in Vinter, Judge Marnie, whilst with respect, diplomatically stressing that the method of making the United Kingdom system compatible was a matter for the United Kingdom, went on to suggest that the material before this court suggests, I quote, clear support for the institution of a dedicated mechanism integrated within the sentencing legislation providing for a review of life sentences after a set period.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>701.97</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>707.73</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We do say, and I say with great respect, as Judge Marnie, of course, is part of the court today.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>707.73</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>715.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We do say that phrase really does not sound like a system that allows a politician to take that decision.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>715.37</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>723.21</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>I should stress at once that these are our submissions that the court should go beyond Vinter and beyond Kafkaris.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>723.21</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>737.21</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>We also stress that even if the court stays with the position as decided in Vinter, we make it plain, the United Kingdom has simply failed to adjust, has simply failed to mend the violation of Article 3.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>737.21</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>773.37</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Above all, we say, the real problem with the Court of Appeals solution, is the evidence analysis, what went wrong in the argument or in the judgment of this court in Vinter?</Text>

		<Snippet>

			<TimestampBegin>4810.12</TimestampBegin>

		<Snippet>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4823.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4831.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The first of them is that it is of course right that in relation to life sentences no minimum term is specified.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4831.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4834.12</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4834.12</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4840.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The second point though in relation to whether release is never considered, we will have to go away and check precisely what is said.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4840.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4846.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It would be right to say that release is not considered by the parole board in these circumstances.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4846.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4850.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But that doesn't of course mean that release can't be considered elsewhere in the ways that I've set out.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4850.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4865.2</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But perhaps the most important submission I need to make clearly is that so far as the government's position as a matter of law, a matter of principle and a matter of practice is concerned, it is as I have set it out to the court today.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4865.2</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4870.48</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But I would return also to the submissions that I made about the practical scenarios here.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4870.48</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4894.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So if a prisoner wishes to take advantage of the procedure under section 30, it seems to us inconceivable that either that prisoner would not have legal advice, or that that prisoner would not make a request in a form which would find its way to the Secretary of State and be considered as a request under section 30.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4894.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4902.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Can I turn to the questions asked by Judge Sio about the legal nature of the LIFA manual?</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4902.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4906.32</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The LIFA manual of course is an expression of policy as Melinda Trent has said.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4906.32</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4909.72</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It is neither statute nor judge made law.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4909.72</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4914.76</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And of course that means it is subordinate to the provisions of the primary legislation.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4914.76</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4933.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>It may be of assistance if I quote from the Newell judgment in this respect, paragraph 32, where the court said, the manual cannot restrict the duty of the Secretary of State to consider all circumstances relevant to release on compassionate grounds.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4933.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4940.16</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>He cannot fetter his discretion by taking into account only the matters set out in the LIFA manual.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4940.16</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4950.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So it is in our submission clear that that is entirely subordinate to the primary legislation and indeed to what the Court of Appeal has said in that judgment.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4950.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4959.04</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>As to what itself is reviewable under judicial review process, that is the decision of the Secretary of State.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4959.04</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4974.56</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So far as the questions posed by Judge Meoney are concerned, I should say in relation to the first part of those questions, that we do not accept that the scope of judicial review in these cases is as narrow as the applicant suggests.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4974.56</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4991.32</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>The position in principle is that the court would make its own mind up as to whether the Secretary of State's decision was compatible with Article 3 and that is because of the Secretary of State's positive obligation to act in accordance with the convention as set out in the Human Rights Act.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4991.32</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>4996.8</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So the court will consider the merits of that decision, not merely its rationality.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>4996.8</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5004.44</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And that we would submit is indeed reflected in the housing association cases that Judge Meoney referred to.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5004.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5008.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>So the answer to his second question is yes.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5008.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5025.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>In relation to the third question, if the court concludes under the judicial review process that no penological grounds exist for continued detention in accordance with Article 3, then it could indeed order release.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5025.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5037.6</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>Turning finally to the questions asked by Judge Turkovich, the precise information given to prisoners when they arrive in prison we will have to check.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5037.6</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5045.36</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But it is of course the case that the effect of a life sentence would be explained to a prisoner at the point of sentence.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5045.36</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5051.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And it is worth confirming that no prisoners have applied under the Section 30 process.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5051.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5062.08</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>But in doing so, can I return to the points I made about the way in which a prisoner would take advantage of that process.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5062.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5067.96</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And again it is worth perhaps confirming for the court that there are no formalities required.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5067.96</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5073.44</TimestampEnd>

		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5073.44</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5084.84</TimestampEnd>
			<Text>And any prisoner writing to indicate that they wish to be considered for release would be considered as a Section 30 application by the Secretary of State.</Text>
		</Snippet>
		<Snippet>
			<Language>en</Language>
			<TimestampBegin>5084.84</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5089.08</TimestampEnd>

			<TimestampBegin>5089.08</TimestampBegin>
			<TimestampEnd>5102.8</TimestampEnd>

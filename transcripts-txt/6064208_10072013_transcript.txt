I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of Ališić and others against Bosnia and Herzegovina and others.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<326.47;328.23;en>>
Good morning.

<<328.23;332.51;en>>
I will speak of my na- also auf russisch.

<<332.51;356.99;ru>>
Господи, уважаемые господа, уважаемые суды.

<<356.99;410.71;ru>>
Мы сматримы, что суд полностью и правильно, в отношении Сербии и Словении, применил право, конвенцию и протоколы, и что правильно решил, когда обязал их моим мандатам платить главный долг, в связи с проследствиями, как это было предназначено в суде.

<<410.71;429.83;ru>>
Мы считаем, что приговоры, которые были заданы в завете Словении и Сербии, что этот случай будет снова рассматриваться перед Великим Великом, не основаны и не аргументированы.

<<429.83;434.87;ru>>
По поводу предназначенных причин, я прошу суд, чтобы подтвердил такое решение.

<<434.87;437.67;ru>>
Второе.

<<437.67;459.79;ru>>
Я прошу суд, связанный с моим вторым мандатом, который я предоставил этому суду, чтобы дать мне сообщение, вопрос, возможно, объяснение, как дальше пройти с этим мандатом.

Je vais donc appeler Mme Mijić.

[[Government;GR5]]

<<503.35;510.43;en>>
Thank you Mr. President, Honourable Judges of the Court.

<<510.43;523.15;en>>
The applicants deposited their savings in Slovenian and Serbian banks and for more than 22 years have not been able to retrieve their savings.

<<523.15;535.03;en>>
The same fate of these three applicants has been shared by hundreds of thousands of savers of the Serbian Invesbank and the Slovenian Ljubljanska Bank.

<<535.03;540.43;en>>
Nevertheless, the present case is a simple case.

<<540.43;570.51;en>>
This fact has been confirmed by numerous final judgments of Slovenian courts which have established that the repayment of foreign currency savings is exclusively a private law issue and that the contractual obligations of the bank towards its savers have been neither conditioned by nor linked to the succession issues of the former Yugoslavia.

<<570.51;589.83;en>>
Slovenian courts also established that the Ljubljanska Bank had been liable for the obligations of its branches outside Slovenia and had to pay out savings to savers of its branches in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<<589.83;605.73;en>>
They also established that the main branch in Sarajevo was not transformed into an independent bank, so Ljubljanska Bank remained liable for the obligations of its main branch in Sarajevo.

<<605.73;616.55;en>>
These facts were also confirmed by the final decisions of the Municipal Court and Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<<616.55;624.35;en>>
Hence, the very essence of this case has already been decided before Slovenian courts.

<<624.35;638.75;en>>
And all arguments of Slovenian government in the present case, including the one concerning the issue of succession, were rejected as ill-founded long time ago.

<<638.75;655.67;en>>
Therefore the problem of return of foreign currency savings in this case is not a result of the solution of former Yugoslavia, but the outcome of unilateral legislative measures of Slovenia and Serbia.

<<655.67;676.63;en>>
Unlike Slovenia and Serbia, Croatia has entirely paid out old foreign currency savings to all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina who had deposited their savings with the branches of the Croatian Splitska Bank on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<<676.63;701.59;en>>
We emphasize that Slovenian Ljubljanska Bank was the most successful bank in the former Yugoslavia, enjoying a full confidence of numerous savers outside Slovenia irrespective of their nationality, which enabled this bank to draw out the foreign currency from other republics of former Yugoslavia.

<<701.59;715.91;en>>
Namely at the end of the 1960s in the former Yugoslavia, people were allowed to go abroad to work, which led to a sudden increase of foreign exchange savings.

<<715.91;723.67;en>>
This prompted Ljubljanska Bank from Slovenia, which had only 1.5 million inhabitants, to

<<723.67;738.75;en>>
strengthen its banking network and especially in the republics where many people worked abroad, primarily in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, each with 4 million inhabitants.

<<738.75;756.43;en>>
In 1969, the Slovenian Ljubljanska Bank established its first branch office in Sarajevo and in other Yugoslav republics with a primary financial interest to collect foreign currency from citizens.

<<756.43;772.39;en>>
Towards the end of the 1970s, branch offices of Ljubljanska Bank transformed into Ljubljanska Bank Basic Banks, which united their labour and assets to form the Ljubljanska Bank United Bank.

<<772.39;787.07;en>>
Unlike Basic Banks, only the United Bank, as an umbrella bank, was authorised to perform all banking operations abroad and to control the use of funds in Basic Banks.

<<787.07;804.49;en>>
Basic Banks of Ljubljanska Bank regularly, on a daily and weekly basis, physically send all surplus of deposited foreign currency to the National Bank of Slovenia for the United Bank Ljubljanska Bank.

<<804.49;831.03;en>>
The documentation we have submitted to the Court proves, beyond any doubt, that in the period between September 1982 and October 1991, a total amount of foreign currency of almost 3 million DM was physically transported from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the National Bank of Slovenia.

<<831.03;844.43;en>>
Additionally, foreign currency of numerous savers from Bosnia and Herzegovina deposited abroad to the accounts of the United Bank Ljubljana were never transported to Bosnia and Herzegovina but remained abroad.

<<844.43;855.15;en>>
For example, in 1976 the applicant Sajak deposited his savings on the account of Ljubljanska Bank in Germany.

<<855.15;864.51;en>>
This deposit was only registered in bookkeeping terms on his account in the branch of Ljubljanska Bank in Sarajevo.

<<864.51;872.79;en>>
United Bank Ljubljana disposed freely with foreign currency physically received from its basic banks.

<<872.79;897.03;en>>
For these purposes and under special mutual contracts, National Bank of Slovenia shipped abroad foreign currency collected by basic banks exclusively on behalf and for United Bank Ljubljana and exclusively upon specified written orders of United Bank Ljubljana.

<<897.03;910.29;en>>
So the claim of Slovenian government that United Bank shipped foreign currency abroad pursuant to the instructions and for the accounts of basic banks is simply not true.

<<910.29;927.69;en>>
The Slovenian government failed to submit any evidence in support of these four allegations, including no proof that United Bank shipped the received foreign currency further to National Bank of Yugoslavia.

<<927.69;944.25;en>>
We emphasize that the Slovenian government with the intent to mislead the court in this case, firstly claimed that no foreign currency from basic banks were ever transferred to Slovenia.

<<944.25;957.97;en>>
After being faced with undisputable evidences to the contrary, they claimed that they red deposited their foreign currency with National Bank of Yugoslavia.

<<957.97;975.81;en>>
Now before Grand Chamber, they make a new false claim that the foreign currency was shipped to the accounts of National Bank of Yugoslavia abroad pursuant to non-existing instructions of basic banks.

<<975.81;1012.93;en>>
To substantiate these completely false claims, Slovenian government submitted absolutely useless and irrelevant documentation to the court which only show some, for the present case, irrelevant transactions of United Bank concerning purchased foreign currency in exchange offices, gas vouchers, cheques and some unspecified shipments of dinners and foreign currency to numerous Yugoslav and foreign banks.

<<1012.93;1035.37;en>>
On 1st January 1990, Ljubljana Bank transformed into a joint stock company and became the legal successor of United Bank Ljubljana and its previous basic banks, which again became branches of Ljubljanska Bank with no legal personality.

<<1035.37;1053.37;en>>
Contrary to Slovenian allegations, Ljubljanska Bank had full control of business operations of its main branch in Sarajevo until May 1992 when the siege of the city Sarajevo started.

<<1053.37;1075.65;en>>
After Slovenia declared its independence in June 1991, Ljubljanska Bank tried to get rid of its liabilities towards savers by an unaccessible attempt to transform its main branch in Sarajevo into a commercial bank.

<<1075.65;1104.29;en>>
In response to this attempt, in October 1991, National Bank of Yugoslavia recognized that the measures of Slovenian financial authorities were unpredictable and that the creators of the Slovenian monetary system had no intention to comply with the absolute obligations of the banks towards savers.

<<1104.29;1110.29;en>>
This unfortunately turned out to be true.

<<1110.29;1122.07;en>>
Under its constitution, Slovenia assumed guarantees only for the foreign currency savings deposited in banks on the Slovenian territory.

<<1122.07;1144.65;en>>
This constitutional measure is clearly unjust, bearing in mind that Slovenia's largest and most successful Ljubljanska Bank was mainly developed by foreign currency savings deposited outside Slovenian territory, which is quite clear since Slovenia had only 1.

<<1144.65;1147.69;en>>
million inhabitants.

<<1147.69;1164.21;en>>
Consequently, while Ljubljanska Bank was collecting foreign currency outside the Slovenian territory and building its empire on these deposits, no territorial principle was applied.

<<1164.21;1177.69;en>>
But now, when it comes to the repayment of hard-earned savings of Bosnian and Croatian savers, the Slovenian authorities insist on this principle.

<<1177.69;1182.85;en>>
This is obviously unfair and hypocritical.

<<1182.85;1204.45;en>>
In 1992, Ljubljanska Bank, which factually and legally took over the extremely successful business and assets of basic banks from other former Yugoslav republics, was internationally successful and the most dominant bank in the Slovenian market.

<<1204.45;1208.61;en>>
So this is 1992.

<<1208.61;1214.93;en>>
This bank also fully owned several successful banks around the world.

<<1214.93;1222.97;en>>
And this was confirmed by the annual report of Ljubljanska Bank at the end of 1991.

<<1222.97;1256.97;en>>
Therefore, we rightly submit that in 1993, a year later, Slovenia initiated a fake rehabilitation procedure for Ljubljanska Bank with the aim of making the Republic of Slovenia the sole owner of this bank and justifying its further constitutional measures, which bluntly violated many of the applicants' rights, as earlier predicted by the National Bank of Yugoslavia.

<<1256.97;1273.61;en>>
Finally, by the 1994 constitutional law, Slovenia unilaterally and arbitrarily restructured the extremely successful old Ljubljanska Bank by founding a new Ljubljanska Bank.

<<1273.61;1289.89;en>>
Under this law, Ljubljanska Bank transferred all assets and business to the new bank, but kept the full liability for saving accounts not guaranteed by the Republic of Slovenia.

<<1289.89;1308.89;en>>
Therefore, due to the 1994 constitutional act, and not due to the solution of former Yugoslavia, Ljubljanska Bank was made insolvent and left with no assets for the repayment of savings.

<<1308.89;1329.61;en>>
By this constitutional manoeuvre, unheard of in a democratic society and undertaken during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, Slovenia literally ripped off Bosnian and Croatian savers of the Ljubljanska Bank.

<<1329.61;1344.29;en>>
This law bluntly violated applicants' property rights, the right to an effective remedy, the right to access to court, and it harshly discriminated against them.

<<1344.29;1354.25;en>>
The applicant, Csakhdanovic, on the other hand, deposited his savings in the branch of the Serbian Invest Bank on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<<1354.25;1366.05;en>>
Under the same relevant legislation of the former Yugoslavia, the Invest Bank, as a legal person, was liable for the obligations of its branches.

<<1366.05;1372.41;en>>
This was confirmed by the final judgment of a Serbian court in the case Csakhdanovic v.

<<1372.41;1375.29;en>>
Yugoslav Export and Credit Bank.

<<1375.29;1387.97;en>>
In this case, a Serbian court ordered a Serbian bank to pay old foreign currency savings deposited in its branch on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<<1387.97;1399.33;en>>
Therefore, it is quite clear that the relationship between the applicant, who is the saver, and the Invest Bank is a private law relationship between a debtor and a creditor.

<<1399.33;1403.53;en>>
Serbia has directly interfered with this private law relationship.

<<1403.53;1417.67;en>>
By its 1998 Foreign Currency Saving Act, Serbia took over, as a public debt, the liabilities arising from the old foreign currency savings deposited with domestic banks.

<<1417.67;1432.69;en>>
By this law, Serbia suspended all court proceedings regarding repayment of the old foreign currency savings and violated the applicant's right to access to court and legal remedy.

<<1432.69;1456.53;en>>
Also under the 2002 Public Debt Act, Serbia, without any reasonable or objective justification, completely excluded from its public debt the claims of savers, citizens of other former Yugoslav republics, and of those savers who deposited their savings outside the Serbian territory.

<<1456.53;1467.37;en>>
We emphasize that all savers on the Invest Bank deposited their savings under the same conditions, regardless of their citizenship and the place of depositing.

<<1467.37;1478.53;en>>
Nevertheless, by its laws, Serbia directly discriminated against savers of its bank on the basis of nationality.

<<1478.53;1486.09;en>>
In January 2002, the bankruptcy procedure of the Invest Bank was initiated.

<<1486.09;1497.49;en>>
Soon after that, the Serbian Deposit Insurance Agency, as a bankruptcy manager, sold out all real property of the Invest Bank in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<<1497.49;1506.57;en>>
Furthermore, Serbia used the bankruptcy estate of the bank to settle its own claims fully.

<<1506.57;1519.65;en>>
Also in a government decision, it has written off the debts of strategically important state-owned companies to the Invest Bank in order to be able to privatize them and gain millions in profit.

<<1520.57;1524.89;en>>
Mrs. Mijić, may I ask you to conclude?

<<1524.89;1526.61;en>>
Your 15 minutes have already expired.

[[Government;GR5]]

<<1528.36;1530.28;en>>
Okay, I'll do that.

<<1530.28;1533.12;en>>
So, I will read the final sentence.

<<1535.28;1542.4;en>>
Of course, we deem Slovenia responsible for the violation of applicant's Shostakovich rights.

<<1542.4;1555.48;en>>
And finally, we deem that this case is completely suitable for the pilot judgment procedure as it concerns a systemic problem of huge number of savers of Slovenian and Serbian banks.

<<1555.48;1568.22;en>>
We strongly believe that only the pilot judgment will once and for all resolve this continuous and long-lasting violation of the rights of the applicants and other numerous savers in the same condition.

<<1568.22;1568.22;en>>
Thank you very much, and I apologize for extending my time.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<1575.13;1578.49;en>>
Thank you, Miss Mijić.

<<1578.49;1579.49;en>>
I call Miss Stažnik.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<1584.15;1586.31;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<1586.31;1605.15;en>>
Respected judges of the Grand Chamber, in today's hearing, I will argue that this case before the court is a matter of private law relationship between the savers and the banks regarding their savings, not an issue of succession among the successor states of the former Yugoslavia.

<<1605.15;1614.83;en>>
Relations and liabilities of successor states within the public law sphere are irrelevant for the resolution of this case before the court.

<<1614.83;1635.79;en>>
As the court rightfully established in its chamber judgments, two states, Republic of Slovenia and Republic of Serbia, unjustifiably interfered into this private law relationship, preventing a large number of savers of their banks to peacefully enjoy their hard-earned money for more than 20 years.

<<1635.79;1656.67;en>>
Other respondent states did not, by their respective legislation, action or practice in any way prevented applicants and other savers of those commercial banks, namely Slovenian Ljubljanska Bank and Serbian Invest Bank, from withdrawing their savings with accumulated interest.

<<1656.67;1671.39;en>>
Honorable judges of the Grand Chamber, deposit contracts concluded between the savers and the banks in former Serfaraje were identical to deposit contracts commercial banks offer today in any market-oriented economy.

<<1671.39;1689.47;en>>
Accordingly, the applicants and all other savers had the right to withdraw their money at any time, while the banks were and still are obliged to fulfill their contractual obligation of paying out the received deposits.

<<1689.47;1701.11;en>>
No bank can refuse to abide by this contractual obligation without a solid legal base, nor could changes in banks' internal organization affect this obligation.

<<1701.11;1715.25;en>>
In ex-Yugoslavia, the federation guarantee for those savings could have been activated only in case of bankruptcy or manifest insolvency, and only at the request of the bank.

<<1715.25;1724.91;en>>
Such a scenario did not take place as neither of those successful banks ever declared bankruptcy or were manifestly insolvent.

<<1724.91;1736.91;en>>
Liability, therefore, did not shift from the banks to ex-Yugoslavia, and the banks remained liable for their debts to savers.

<<1736.91;1745.87;en>>
Thus, obviously, the private law relationship between the savers and those banks survived the dissolution of Serfaraje.

<<1745.87;1759.55;en>>
As the court rightfully established in the chamber judgment, when the Republic of Slovenia became independent state, it nationalized Ljubljanska Bank, which owed unreturned savings to a large number of its savers.

<<1759.55;1767.59;en>>
As the owner of the bank, Republic of Slovenia became the only one liable for the bank's profit and debts.

<<1767.59;1775.99;en>>
After nationalization, Republic of Slovenia used legislative measures in order to avoid its liability towards the savers.

<<1775.99;1801.07;en>>
In the night on 26 to 27 July in 1994, the Slovenian parliament, at a closed session and by secret procedure, enacted the 1994 Constitutional Act, the legislation of highest constitutional rank, permanently preventing applicants and many other savers to recover their savings deposited into Ljubljanska Bank.

<<1801.07;1830.55;en>>
By this act, Republic of Slovenia transferred all assets and businesses of its Ljubljanska Bank to Nova Ljubljanska Bank, leaving the now called Old Ljubljanska Bank literally without assets, but however liable in full for foreign currency savings collected in its branches outside the Republic of Slovenia, precisely in its branch in Sarajevo, Zagreb, and Skopje.

<<1830.55;1838.11;en>>
The next logical question which comes to mind is where the savers' money ended up.

<<1838.11;1870.63;en>>
Considering the fact that the savers' foreign currency deposits were deposited by Ljubljanska Bank on its accounts abroad, outside the SFRJ, or in vaults of National Bank of Slovenia, and that this money was never a part of succession mass, nor was it divided between the main bank and its Zagreb, Sarajevo, or Skopje branch, the conclusion is that the money did end up in Ljubljana, and still is it at Ljubljana disposal.

<<1870.63;1875.55;en>>
Slovenia hasn't proved to the contrary during the case before the court.

<<1875.55;1886.91;en>>
Therefore, the government respectfully invites the court to eliminate any doubt to where the foreign currency savings from branches ended up.

<<1886.91;1906.53;en>>
It is important to note that precisely the assets and businesses of Zagreb, Sarajevo, and Skopje branches of Ljubljanska Bank, mostly based on savers' foreign currency deposits, accounted to the majority of Ljubljanska Bank Ljubljana assets and businesses.

<<1906.53;1913.11;en>>
From the beginning of 1990s, those assets have been trapped in the hands of the Republic of Slovenia.

<<1913.11;1927.75;en>>
Nota bene, loans which Ljubljanska Bank granted to companies seated in Croatia represented only 1 10th of the funds obtained by its Zagreb branch on behalf of Ljubljanska Bank.

<<1927.75;1935.97;en>>
Moreover, Ljubljanska Bank granted those loans with interest adjusted to profitable margin.

<<1935.97;1946.35;en>>
Those loans, therefore, cannot be deemed to be investments in the Croatian economy, but solely and exclusively the means of making a profit by Ljubljanska Bank.

<<1946.35;1955.41;en>>
It has collected 10 times more foreign currency in its Zagreb branch than it has returned into Croatian economy.

<<1955.41;1965.67;en>>
From the above said, it is evident that the persistent Slovenia's argument about its investment into Croatian economy is unfounded.

<<1965.67;1974.43;en>>
Respected judges of the court, Slovenia's arguments relating to the insolvency of Ljubljanska Bank are also illogical and unfounded.

<<1974.43;1986.75;en>>
The mere fact that the Republic of Slovenia founded Nova Ljubljanska Bank using the assets and business of old Ljubljanska Bank proves that these assets were sufficient for normal business of a bank.

<<1986.75;1999.59;en>>
In fact, these assets and business were enough to make Nova Ljubljanska Bank one of the largest internationally recognized banks with excellent credit ratings.

<<1999.59;2012.95;en>>
The government of Croatia points out that the aim of rehabilitation of a company is settling at last part of its debts to the creditors and enabling further business operations.

<<2012.95;2024.75;en>>
Rehabilitation of a company cannot be achieved by confiscation of all company's assets and transfer of its business to the new company, as Slovenia did with Ljubljanska Bank.

<<2024.75;2033.71;en>>
Therefore, Croatia deems that the old Ljubljanska Bank could not be rehabilitated through the establishment of Nova Ljubljanska Bank.

<<2033.71;2053.19;en>>
That is yet another proof that inability of the Ljubljanska Bank to service its debts is the result of actions undertaken by Slovenia, which transferred by virtue of law its assets and businesses to another bank, instead enabling the bank to continue its business.

<<2053.19;2064.23;en>>
Accordingly, it is obvious that Republic of Slovenia interfered into the private law relationship within the service and its bank, and as the chamber rightfully concluded.

<<2064.23;2075.19;en>>
Slovenia allegations that applicants' inability to recover their deposits originates from breakup of suffragette are therefore completely unfounded and misleading.

<<2075.19;2083.63;en>>
They cannot serve as a justified reason to prevent its banks repaying their non-Slovenian service.

<<2083.63;2094.87;en>>
Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia were in the same, even worse financial position than Slovenia, faced with war and major humanitarian crisis.

<<2094.87;2105.09;en>>
Despite of that, they still enabled their banks to repay debts to their savers, irrespective of their nationality and location.

<<2105.09;2115.83;en>>
Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia also had their banks, which collected foreign currency throughout suffragette.

<<2115.83;2119.67;en>>
They do not have similar issues with the savers of its banks.

<<2119.67;2125.51;en>>
Neither of these states ever undertook measures comparable to those of Republic of Slovenia.

<<2125.51;2139.59;en>>
Quite contrary, as the court rightfully established, Croatia and Macedonia have repaid a large part of all foreign currency savings, even as an interim measure for branches of Ljubljanska Bank on their territory.

<<2139.59;2149.71;en>>
Nevertheless, they never abandoned their position that Slovenia should be held liable and continue to claim compensation at interstate level.

<<2149.71;2176.83;en>>
Because of unprecedented measures taken by the Republic of Slovenia, sole shareholder of the old Ljubljanska Bank, which by the constitutional law transferred assets and business of this bank to another bank, and thus prevented this bank to service its debts, Slovenia should be liable for the bank's debt to the applicants and all other savers of its branches in ex Yugoslavia, who are in the same position as applicants.

<<2176.83;2181.55;en>>
During proceedings before the court, Slovenia has not proved to the contrary.

<<2181.55;2192.83;en>>
Slovenia not only omitted to take interim measures aimed at protecting the interests of its savers, but it also denied them any effective remedy in that respect.

<<2192.83;2211.87;en>>
As the chamber rightfully concluded, every attempt by savers to recover their savings has been futile since Slovenia has not offered savers of Ljubljanska Bank any remedy to deal with the substance of their claim under the convention and to grant them appropriate relief.

<<2211.87;2221.27;en>>
Savers who have used legal remedies, Slovenia offered, and those who have not are basically in the same position.

<<2221.27;2228.43;en>>
As the judgments obtained, either from Slovenia or other courts have remained ineffective in practice.

<<2228.43;2234.31;en>>
Civil actions against Ljubljanska Bank in Slovenian courts offer no reasonable chance of success.

<<2234.31;2239.59;en>>
They are unenforceable since Ljubljanska Bank in Ljubljana has no assets.

<<2239.59;2249.27;en>>
Civil action against the Republic of Slovenia before Slovenian courts are ineffective because all such actions have been rejected by Slovenian courts.

<<2249.27;2263.27;en>>
A petition to Slovenian Constitutional Court for the constitutional review of the provisions of the Constitutional Act would also be in vain since the provision of this constitutional act cannot be subject to such a review.

<<2263.27;2278.95;en>>
Additionally, the remedy Croatia offered before its courts, that is civil action against Ljubljanska Bank, is unenforceable in Slovenia because Slovenia has explicitly denied that possibility.

<<2278.95;2297.39;en>>
The fact remains that the Republic of Slovenia did not provide a single piece of evidence capable of proving that various remedies it claims effective have never resulted in payment of all foreign currency savings to applicants or any other savers in the same legal position.

<<2297.39;2312.43;en>>
As regards discrimination, the 1994 Constitutional Act differently treated only one category of savers, that is savers of the bank who invested in Ljubljanska Bank in their branches in Zagreb, Sarajevo, and Skopje.

<<2312.43;2338.67;en>>
Although they entered into the identical contractual relationship based on the same legislation with the Ljubljanska Bank as those savers who deposited their money on territories of Slovenia, only the non-Slovene savers were explicitly denied return of their savings and were denied of effective legal remedies to pursue their claims before the court.

<<2338.67;2351.91;en>>
In such different treatment, Republic of Slovenia has not objectively and reasonably justified, neither they are proportional as to the means employed and the aims sought to be realized.

<<2351.91;2367.03;en>>
Therefore, the applicants in this case and 8,000 other applicants before the court, as well as many other savers who are in the same position as applicants, had no other opportunity but to seek justice before this court.

<<2367.03;2382.67;en>>
The government points out that the Slovene Bank collected foreign currency savings from citizens of other republics of the former Yugoslavia over a period of about 30 years, disposed of them freely, invested them, and earned profit.

<<2382.67;2398.79;en>>
Precisely because this method before the court is of private law nature, and because the fact that savers' foreign currency deposits survived the solution of Sarajevo, the measures taken by Slovenia directly violated its obligations under convention.

<<2398.79;2405.19;en>>
In the same circumstances, Republic of Serbia took similar measures in respect of Invest Bank.

<<2405.19;2418.95;en>>
Therefore, Slovenia and Serbia should be held liable for a violation of the rights to peaceful enjoyment of property, right to effective remedy, and the right not to be discriminated against in the case before the court.

<<2418.95;2429.03;en>>
Honorable judges, in order not to repeat arguments relevant to this case, we will align ourselves with the Bosnian-Herzegovina pleading just side.

<<2429.03;2429.77;en>>
Thank you for your attention.

[[Government;GR6]]

<<2442.84;2455.12;en>>
Honourable judges, the assumption of the liability of the Republic of Serbia in this case is based on two grounds. The fact that Tuzla branch was a branch of Investbanka and that

<<2455.12;2460.98;en>>
the seat of Investbanka was in Serbia. And the fact that most of the funds of Investbanka

<<2460.98;2466.6;en>>
Tuzla branch most likely ended up in Serbia. Accordingly, the respondent will refute both

<<2466.6;2473.6;en>>
the assumptions. The question before us deals with foreign currency savings that were guaranteed

<<2473.6;2481.6;en>>
by the SFRY. These guarantees are recognised as a part of financial liabilities of the

<<2481.6;2496.8;en>>
SFRY as it is specifically regulated by the agreement on succession issues concluded between the respondent states in Vienna on 20 June 2001. What is more, Article 7 of the agreement

<<2496.8;2508.84;en>>
precisely deals with these guarantees prescribing the obligation of the successor states to negotiate the issue of hard currency savings. The question of the old foreign currency savings

<<2508.84;2514.72;en>>
is undoubtedly a question to be solved with regard to the law of succession. Even though

<<2514.72;2533.66;en>>
some of the respondent states in this case have tried to show that this matter should be dealt with as a private law matter between a bank and its clients, it has been clear that this issue has long left the realm of private law. For this, it is irrelevant that

<<2533.66;2540.88;en>>
SFRY guarantees for the deposits were never activated. The savings became the matter of

<<2540.88;2546.6;en>>
public debt, explicitly recognised by the laws passed in each of the successor states.

<<2546.6;2558.66;en>>
The states became liable for the savings directly, not because those were state-owned banks, but because the laws obliged the states to recover the savings. The only legal basis

<<2558.66;2572.56;en>>
in international law that deals with the issue of SFRY, old foreign currency savings, is the Vienna Succession Agreement from 2001. The legitimacy of this agreement was recently

<<2572.56;2589.88;en>>
confirmed through the Memorandum of Understanding concluded in March 2013, which states that the settlement for the transferred foreign currency savings of Ljubljana's bank in Croatia will be found on the basis of the Agreement on Succession Issues. Nevertheless, both Bosnia

<<2589.88;2600.78;en>>
and Herzegovina and Croatia tried to show that Annex C of the Succession Agreement is not applicable in the case of old foreign currency savings. This endeavour is entirely

<<2600.78;2612.24;en>>
understandable, bearing in mind that the failure to continue the negotiation process and reach agreement on this matter is due to obstruction by these two states. Bosnia and Herzegovina

<<2612.24;2626.9;en>>
should have organised the continuation of negotiations, but failed to do so since 2009, while Croatia was obstructing the process for eight years from 2002 until 2010. Regardless

<<2626.9;2640.24;en>>
of the motives of the two states to show that Annex C is not applicable in this matter, their efforts are futile. Simply reading of Annex C clearly shows that the old foreign

<<2640.24;2648.04;en>>
currency savings do indeed form part of succession issues dealt with by the Annex. Furthermore,

<<2648.04;2658.88;en>>
the Honourable Court has itself acknowledged this fact, for instance, in the decision on admissibility, in this case in paragraph 38. On the other hand, considering these issues

<<2658.88;2665.98;en>>
under Annex G would effectively lead to revision of the Succession Agreement. In conclusion,

<<2665.98;2678.4;en>>
it is undisputed that the issue at stake is an issue related to succession, and that the applicable international standards are embodied in the Vienna Convention on Succession. Consequently,

<<2678.4;2690.08;en>>
any issue regarding this matter can be settled in line with these rules and through political negotiations. That is not an issue which could be resolved in court proceedings and without

<<2690.08;2695.64;en>>
the consent of one side. The courts of other jurisdictions have decided so as well, as

<<2695.64;2716.72;en>>
shown in the observation of Serbia, and also supported by the decisions of the courts in the United States of America, submitted as Annexes VI and VII to the observations, as well as by the decision of the court in Cyprus, referred to in Annex I of 18 May.

<<2716.72;2728.32;en>>
In regard to succession issues, a submission from paragraph 16 of the Slovenian observation should be mentioned. Namely, though accepting that the old foreign currency savings belong

<<2728.32;2755.0;en>>
to the succession process, in this paragraph Slovenia seeks to place an entire burden on Serbia, claiming that foreign exchange reserves of the SFRY were misappropriated by Serbia and that they remain substantially undistributed, by which Slovenia clearly tries to show that they remain at the disposal of Serbia. This submission is entirely unfounded and not corroborated

<<2755.0;2761.84;en>>
with any evidence. Namely, besides the fact that the most of foreign currency was transferred

<<2761.84;2786.96;en>>
only pro forma, as explained in detail by the Respondent states in their observations and submitted documents, the foreign currency savings actually transferred to the National Bank of Yugoslavia automatically became a part of the foreign currency reserves of the SFRY. These reserves were governed by bodies in which all the constituent republics of

<<2786.96;2794.52;en>>
the SFRY had their representatives. Therefore, all the republics, later the successor states,

<<2794.52;2802.92;en>>
were fully aware of the assets of SFRY had. Thus, the claim of exclusive possession of

<<2802.92;2808.88;en>>
Serbia of the relevant documentation are devoid of any foundation.

<<2808.88;2814.0;en>>
Furthermore, the foreign currency reserves were divided by the succession agreement.

<<2814.0;2833.16;en>>
At the meeting of the committee in charge in Ljubljana in 2005, the authorized representatives of the successor states agreed on distribution of funds on the foreign currency accounts on the National Bank of Yugoslavia with foreign commercial banks. Moreover, the assets were

<<2833.16;2841.2;en>>
indeed divided, as clearly shown by the documents submitted by the Government of Serbia as Annex 2 of 18 May.

<<2841.2;2856.6;en>>
The Government of Serbia further submits that even if this Court decides to resolve the issue of the old foreign currency savings, the only reasonable solution would be to apply territorial principle. Firstly, because this is an internationally accepted standard in

<<2856.6;2862.72;en>>
doctrine and in practice in succession matters, for instance, Czechoslovakia and Soviet Union.

<<2862.72;2869.28;en>>
Secondly, because this is a principle explicitly accepted by the countries in question. Bosnia

<<2869.28;2886.04;en>>
and Herzegovina also internally recognize this principle, given that the Act on the Settlement of the Public Debt states the provision of funds shall be based on the location of each deposit bank or its affiliates or the lowest operating units. Croatia also initially

<<2886.04;2911.76;en>>
embraced this principle, accepting liability not only for the savings deposited in the banks which had seats in Croatia, but also enabling Croatian servers who had savings in banks that during the time of the SFRY did not have their seat in Croatia to receive payments in the same way as savers with Croatian banks. This was stated in Croatian observation,

<<2911.76;2914.28;en>>
paragraph 71.

<<2914.28;2920.4;en>>
Further Croatian contention in paragraph 87 of its observation is misleading. The principle

<<2920.4;2937.92;en>>
of territoriality is to be applied among the successor states as a principle governing succession, and therefore it is not relevant to the relations of the banks with its branch offices in the territory of other countries. Notwithstanding the subsequent removal of

<<2937.92;2957.04;en>>
Ljubljana Bank and Investbank from the scope of Bosnian legislation, the fact is that the all foreign currency savers of Investbank branch in Tuzla were entitled by the 1997 Act to use their savings in process of privatization. By this Act, Bosnian Herzegovina has effectively

<<2957.04;2969.52;en>>
acknowledged its liability for the contesting savings and created a reasonable expectation on the part of the savers that it would recover their savings. The unilateral Act by which

<<2969.52;2981.16;en>>
Bosnia later arbitrarily excluded Ljubljana Bank and Investbank from the scope of its liability cannot nullify this. Concerning the allegation of Bosnian Herzegovina

<<2981.16;3007.8;en>>
that by the 1998 Act Serbia recognized foreign currency savings as public debt regardless whether savings were deposited with the bank's seat or with its branch offices, it should be noted that the citizens with residence in former republics could have claimed their rights only under the condition of reciprocity. In any case, the 2002 Act, applicable at the

<<3007.8;3018.84;en>>
time of entering into force of the Convention in regard to Serbia, did not prescribe such possibility. The Court found in Molnar-Gabor and Kecman cases that limitations contained

<<3018.84;3024.2;en>>
in 2002 Act were legitimate. The second ground of the liability of the

<<3024.2;3034.92;en>>
Republic of Serbia in the Chamber judgment is the alleged fact that the most of funds of Investbanka Tuzla branch most likely ended up in Serbia. This allegation, however, is

<<3034.92;3040.56;en>>
not supported by objective facts. Even though the Tuzla branch of Investbanka was formerly

<<3040.56;3055.28;en>>
a part of the bank based in Belgrade, analysis of the statute shows clearly that it had significant independence from the bank. The level of independence is evident, among other, from the 1986 decision

<<3055.28;3067.14;en>>
on establishment of the universal business units, which was submitted to the Court as Annex 3 of 18 May. It is clear that universal business units had a decisive

<<3067.14;3073.94;en>>
role in the area of granting and taking loans and other related matters. Also, the relevant

<<3073.94;3087.12;en>>
articles of the statute submitted to the Court as Annex 5 of 18 May demonstrate that the branch offices were considerably independent. Most strikingly, Article 58 of

<<3087.12;3099.84;en>>
Investbanka statute provides that each business unit of Investbanka could place loans only up to the amount of deposits it collected. The basic banks were not allowed to grant

<<3099.84;3112.0;en>>
foreign currency loans or to keep the foreign currency on the accounts abroad, so they had to sell the foreign currency in exchange for DINAs, which were then given as loans. However,

<<3112.0;3130.08;en>>
due to inflation and devaluation of DINAR value, the sum of banks received in return from their debtors decreased dramatically. From 1981 to 1989, DINAR loans were devaluated

<<3130.08;3140.48;en>>
3,800 times. Therefore, these loans represented a loss for the banks and a gain for the loan

<<3140.48;3147.36;en>>
beneficiaries. In the 2004 report of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, it was

<<3147.36;3166.88;en>>
concluded that the local banks provided loans to local commercial entities and individuals from the respective regions who were thus finally beneficiaries of these all-foreign currency deposits. The evidence of this was also submitted by other respondent states.

<<3166.88;3181.92;en>>
In conclusion, Serbia reiterates that the Honourable Court has no jurisdiction to decide on succession issues. Furthermore, the applications are not admissible in regard to Serbia for

<<3181.92;3188.0;en>>
the reasons elaborated in the observations. The fact that the seat of Investbanka was

<<3188.0;3195.6;en>>
in Serbia is irrelevant since Bosnian legislation created legitimate expectation of Mr. Šardanović

<<3195.6;3201.92;en>>
to recover his savings in Bosnia and Herzegovina. On the other hand, Serbian legislation at

<<3201.92;3208.08;en>>
the relevant time provided no grounds for such expectations. The responsibility of Serbia

<<3208.08;3225.36;en>>
should not be established just because certain legal provisions in the Act of another country arbitrarily excluded certain category of people from their right to demand their foreign currency savings. As shown above, final beneficiaries of the loans granted on the basis of the foreign

<<3225.36;3232.08;en>>
currency deposits with Invest Tuzla branch were local commercial entities and individuals.

<<3232.08;3242.88;en>>
Ultimately, these loans were a significant loss for the banks so it cannot be claimed that the money ended up in Serbia. Also, Serbia finds that there is not enough similarity

<<3242.88;3254.48;en>>
in respect of the position of all foreign currency savers to justify the application of pilot procedure as stated by the Court in paragraph 41 of the Jelicic case.

<<3254.48;3264.56;en>>
Finally, with regard to the just satisfaction claim, the Court should take into account the limitation concerning the payment of all currency savings prescribed by Serbian legislation.

<<3264.56;3278.08;en>>
These limitations were recognized as legitimate in the Court's case law, for instance, in Molnar-Gabor judgment. Thank you for your attention and we remain at the Court's disposal

<<3278.08;3280.16;en>>
for any additional observations and clarification. Thank you.

[[Government;GR3]]

<<3293.5;3296.88;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members,

<<3296.88;3309.74;en>>
this case is essentially an interstate case in which the lack of proof of the applicants' deposits has largely been ignored.

<<3309.74;3314.88;en>>
The applicants' deposits have never been verified, not even under Bosnian law.

<<3314.88;3324.46;en>>
And there is no evidence of any deposit in this case after 1991.

<<3324.46;3331.36;en>>
So not even the applicants' council has been able to vouch for these deposits.

<<3331.36;3337.44;en>>
In the absence of proof, the applications must be dismissed.

<<3337.44;3343.32;en>>
They cannot be used as a vehicle to resolve an interstate dispute.

<<3343.32;3356.08;en>>
I quote from the Chamber Judgment, paragraph 7, it would appear that the applicants had certain balances in their accounts at an unspecified date.

<<3356.08;3361.0;en>>
Appearance is not enough.

<<3361.0;3365.6;en>>
This case is fundamentally a succession case.

<<3365.6;3383.98;en>>
The evidence shows when Yugoslavia dissolved, the SFOI was in financial disarray, the Yugoslav banks in crisis, all foreign currency deposits were frozen by the SFOI in response to massive withdrawals.

<<3383.98;3392.2;en>>
The banks had deposited $12 billion in foreign currency with the National Bank of Yugoslavia.

<<3392.2;3400.76;en>>
75% of the basic bank's assets consisted of claims against the NBY.

<<3400.76;3408.76;en>>
I refer the court, for example, to Croatia's enclosure, number 3, pages 6 and 8.

<<3408.76;3411.64;en>>
The NBY defaulted on this debt.

<<3411.64;3425.64;en>>
Having lost their main debtor after the SFOI ceased to exist, the Yugoslav banks, including Lubyanka Banka, were not in a position to repay the foreign currency deposits.

<<3425.64;3436.54;en>>
The NBY is a state organ, so its assets and debts are subject to division among the successor states pursuant to rules of state succession.

<<3436.54;3447.6;en>>
The SFOI, however, claimed to be the sole successor entitled to all NBY assets, a substantial portion of which was used.

<<3447.6;3455.12;en>>
So the successor states, therefore, did not assume the NBY's debt towards the banks.

<<3455.12;3461.72;en>>
They assumed instead direct responsibility for foreign currency deposits.

<<3461.72;3476.8;en>>
And as Judge Reis explained in his concurring opinion in Kovacic versus Slovenia, it is precisely for this reason that this case is essentially a succession case.

<<3476.8;3482.48;en>>
This case is not about state interference with private law claims against banks.

<<3482.48;3491.0;en>>
And it is not about the liability of a respondent state for the debts of a state-owned bank.

<<3491.0;3529.72;en>>
Gracious and Bosnia's denial that this case is a succession case is belied, for example, by their participation in four rounds of negotiations to distribute the debt that issue mediated by the Bank for International Settlements and accede to the agreement on succession issues, a memorandum of understanding executed between Slovenia and Croatia on March 11, 2013, and a joint letter of Slovenia and Croatia to the Bank for International Settlements that was executed last Friday.

<<3529.72;3555.28;en>>
The Republic of Slovenia submits that in the absence of a negotiated solution, liability for foreign currency deposits should be divided pursuant to the territorial or final beneficiary principle, the primary criterion to distribute a predecessor state's debt under rules of state succession.

<<3555.28;3567.6;en>>
I would point out that that principle has also been accepted as equitable by the World Bank, by the London Club, and by the Paris Club in allocating the SFRY's external debt.

<<3567.6;3580.8;en>>
And it was also applied by Bosnia in dividing the debt that issue here, liability for foreign currency deposits among its constituent entities.

<<3580.8;3593.88;en>>
This liability was incurred by the SFRY and its MBY vis-a-vis particular banks in a particular region, in this case, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<<3593.88;3599.8;en>>
For the benefit of a particular republic, again, Bosnia.

<<3599.8;3611.48;en>>
In exchange for the foreign currency that the basic bank Sarajevo deposited with the MBY, it received low-cost DINA loans.

<<3611.48;3619.32;en>>
And the bank used these subsidized DINA loans to finance investments in Bosnia.

<<3619.32;3634.48;en>>
There is not even a shred of evidence to support the allegation that the Associated Bank in Ljubljana, rather than the basic banks in Zagreb or Sarajevo, would have received these DINA loans and invested them in Slovenia.

<<3634.48;3637.36;en>>
This allegation is plainly false.

<<3637.36;3659.04;en>>
I draw the Court's attention to Slovenia's Chamber Annex 289, paragraph 9, to the basic bank Sarajevo's contracts concluded in accordance with the legislation Slovenia's Annexes 4 and 5, and Deloitte's expert report, Slovenia's Annex 123, page 4.

<<3659.04;3674.0;en>>
A document submitted by Bosnia, which is translated in Slovenia's Annex 117, shows every single large loan made by the basic bank Sarajevo was extended to companies in Bosnia.

<<3674.0;3685.28;en>>
And by contrast, the loans that were extended to Slovenian companies were all exclusively funded by the 14 basic banks in Slovenia.

<<3685.28;3700.04;en>>
I submit that on these facts, division of liability for old foreign currency deposits pursuant to the head office principle or nationality of the banks would be wholly inequitable.

<<3700.04;3703.04;en>>
Now, this brings me to a key issue in these proceedings.

<<3703.04;3713.12;en>>
What actually happened with the old foreign currency deposits received by the banks, and who ultimately benefited from them?

<<3713.12;3715.8;en>>
Now, as in any banking system, the answer is simple.

<<3715.8;3720.76;en>>
The bank that receives the deposits uses them.

<<3720.76;3731.72;en>>
And I'd like to draw the court's attention to a 1992 study precisely on the subject of the use of old foreign currency deposits, Grazier's enclosure 3.

<<3731.72;3739.16;en>>
And that enclosure describes on page 16 how the basic banks used foreign currency deposits.

<<3739.16;3744.16;en>>
According to the study, they deposited most of them with the NBY.

<<3744.16;3749.8;en>>
They used inflows of foreign currency deposits to repay their depositors.

<<3749.8;3759.64;en>>
And they used them to pay for certain imports and, quote, goods for vital necessities of the republic in which the bank was based.

<<3759.64;3772.88;en>>
Again, there is not a shred of evidence that the foreign currency cash shipped by the bank in Sarajevo was misappropriated in Slovenia.

<<3772.88;3776.12;en>>
These are gross misrepresentations.

<<3776.12;3796.0;en>>
Grazier and Bosnia would infer misappropriation from the fact that the associated bank shipped cash for the Sarajevo basic bank using cash transportation and board services of the National Bank of Slovenia.

<<3796.0;3806.4;en>>
This inference is no stronger than an inference that DHL misappropriated goods that it transported to its distribution center.

<<3809.16;3819.6;en>>
The evidence shows that the Sarajevo basic bank shipped foreign currency cash to NBY accounts abroad.

<<3819.6;3827.76;en>>
And as of mid-October 1988, to the bank's own accounts abroad.

<<3827.76;3854.64;en>>
The relevant NBY resolution, Slovenia's Annex 9, paragraph 2, and chamber Annex 289, paragraph 8, required the banks to deposit foreign currency cash from deposits of Yugoslav citizens, quote, in the accounts of the national bank managed by foreign banks, close quote.

<<3854.64;3858.44;en>>
And I would emphasize after 1978.

<<3858.44;3872.04;en>>
So when the cash shipments at issue occur, it was all net inflows of foreign currency deposits that were shipped, physically shipped, to NBY accounts abroad.

<<3872.04;3896.08;en>>
The accounting method or performer method in this period only applied to interest, as is explained in clear terms, for example, in a 1988 memorandum authored by the National Bank of Yugoslavia, which is Slovenia's Annex 10, pages 13 and 18.

<<3896.08;3908.68;en>>
With respect to other foreign currency cash received by the basic bank Sarajevo, for example, tourism or Yugoslav experts, most of that cash was sold to the NBY.

<<3908.68;3928.72;en>>
And pursuant to an NBY degree, Slovenia's Chamber Annex 383, and implementing NBY instructions, Slovenia's Chamber Annex 291, paragraph 2, such foreign currency cash also had to be dispatched to NBY accounts abroad.

<<3932.0;3940.28;en>>
Slovenia has submitted cash transportation records in Annexes 14 and 15.

<<3940.28;3954.36;en>>
These cash transportation records show that between 1983 and 1991, the National Bank of Slovenia transported foreign currency cash of 4 billion deutschmarks.

<<3954.36;3961.6;en>>
This was cash from all parts of Yugoslavia to foreign banks abroad.

<<3961.6;3973.28;en>>
Upon the transfer to NBY accounts abroad, the Associated Bank in Ljubljana would confirm the transfer by talax to the basic bank.

<<3973.28;3985.04;en>>
I refer the court to a series of confirming talaxes in Slovenia's Annexes 12, 13, and 19.

<<3985.04;4006.04;en>>
As confirmed on pages 23 and 24 of the Deloitte report, the extensive financial documents in this record can be searched in vain for any claim against Slovenian banks as a result of the cash transportation and vault services they rendered.

<<4006.04;4011.84;en>>
No such claim has ever been made outside this court.

<<4011.84;4020.92;en>>
LBD Zagajevo was audited by the Bosnian State Institute for Accounting and Auditing in 1998.

<<4020.92;4024.98;en>>
The audit report shows claims against the NBY.

<<4024.98;4032.82;en>>
Against the NBY for foreign currency deposited by the Zagajevo bank, 296 million deutschmarks.

<<4032.82;4036.92;en>>
Slovenia's Annex 100, pages 31 and 54.

<<4036.92;4051.96;en>>
In stark contrast, this audit report shows claims against the bank in Ljubljana of only 27,000 deutschmarks on page 16.

<<4051.96;4069.72;en>>
This document also entirely refutes the allegations that when Slovenia restructured Ljubljanska Banka in 1994, it transferred all assets from the Zagajevo main branch to NLBDD.

<<4069.72;4077.6;en>>
The audit report shows assets of LBD Zagajevo of 334 million deutschmarks.

<<4077.6;4084.84;en>>
Of this amount, 296 million are the Zagajevo basic banks' claims against the NBY.

<<4084.84;4092.32;en>>
It must be kept in mind that the Zagajevo main branch was effectively nationalized in 1993.

<<4092.32;4100.32;en>>
So its assets were transferred with Bosnia's authorization to LBD Zagajevo, not NLBDD.

<<4100.32;4115.28;en>>
Equally false are Bosnia's ungracious allegations that no rehabilitation was required and that Slovenia somehow introduced fake banking rehabilitation measures in 1993.

<<4115.28;4120.36;en>>
It suffices to look at the 1991 and 1992 annual reports.

<<4120.36;4127.84;en>>
Slovenia's chamber annexes 9 and 76 to completely destroy such absurd allegations.

<<4127.84;4138.24;en>>
And contrary to what we heard before, Ljubljanska Banka was certainly not an extremely successful bank, it was on the verge of bankruptcy.

<<4138.24;4147.72;en>>
Indeed, if one looks at the 1992 annual report, it had incurred a net loss of more than 1 billion deutschmarks.

<<4147.72;4155.44;en>>
Now to put this in relation to its capital, it succeeded by 10 times LBDD's capital.

<<4155.44;4170.64;en>>
So the allegation that Ljubljanska Banka and its Croatian and Bosnian operations were extremely successful is obviously entirely belied by the financial statements.

<<4170.64;4177.64;en>>
To conclude, the applications against Slovenia are inadmissible and lack merit.

<<4177.64;4186.32;en>>
They should be dismissed if they were nonetheless used to resolve what is essentially an interstate dispute.

<<4186.32;4191.84;en>>
Its resolution must accord with the rules of state succession.

<<4191.84;4191.84;en>>

Thank you very much, Ms. Annacker.

<<4197.03;4199.83;en>>
Mr. Bogdanov on behalf of Macedonia.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<4203.25;4207.13;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4207.13;4212.25;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court, ladies and gentlemen,

<<4212.25;4231.81;en>>
taking into account the time the last speaker and the respected Court has already heard numerous arguments regarding the applicants' complaints today, I will attempt to deliver the pleading of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia as short as possible by focusing on two crucial points.

<<4231.81;4240.17;en>>
The first one being the characterization in law of the relationship between the applicants and their respective banks.

<<4240.17;4251.37;en>>
And the second one, the inadmissibility of the application with respect to the Republic of Macedonia on the grounds of ratione loci and ratione personae.

<<4251.37;4271.17;en>>
As to the first point, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia argues that the present case is one concerning a private legal relationship between the applicants on the one hand and their banks in which they deposited their foreign currency savings on the other.

<<4271.17;4292.93;en>>
Therefore it follows that the distinguished Court has the competence to examine in full the specific facts of the case and to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the individual interest on one hand and the public interest on the other, taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the present case.

<<4292.93;4314.09;en>>
In contrast, it would seem that this Court has no jurisdiction to examine the slow pace of mutual settlements of the respondent states regarding the already taken guarantees towards the savers converted into their public debt, which of course is not the applicant's case.

<<4314.09;4333.81;en>>
This line of reasoning is further substantiated by the Chamber's judgment of November 2012, where it was rightfully concluded that the applicant's position differs from the position of the persons who benefited from the repayment schemes established by the successor states.

<<4333.81;4345.23;en>>
The Chamber ruling on Article 46 of the Convention excluded from payment the persons who have already been paid their savings by the respondent states.

<<4345.23;4366.61;en>>
At the same time, the Chamber in its judgment did not empower the successor states to claim reimbursement for the funds paid to the savers, for example in Ljubljana Skopje and Zagreb branches, thus preserving this question in the public law field and the succession process.

<<4366.61;4372.85;en>>
In the case of Kovacic and others v. Slovenia, the Grand Chamber of this Court decided to

<<4372.85;4385.77;en>>
strike the applications out of its list of cases, relying on Article 37 of the Convention, paragraph 1b and c, and not on ratione materia reason.

<<4385.77;4408.85;en>>
Furthermore, and relating to the third applicant in that case, the Grand Chamber did not find it justified to continue with the examination of her case because proceedings were simultaneously pending in Croatia, in fora where other claimants in the same situation have already been successful in redressing their grievances.

<<4408.85;4429.53;en>>
Thus the reasoning behind the judgment leads to the conclusion that the Grand Chamber acknowledged the private law relationship between the banks and the groups of savers in the former Yugoslavia who did not manage to convert their private claims into a public debt of one of the successor states.

<<4429.53;4445.77;en>>
Further supporting arguments of the Government's position that the case at issue concerns private legal relationship between the applicants and the banks may be found in the written observations of all respondent states submitted to this Court.

<<4445.77;4467.33;en>>
Namely, the Government of Serbia argues that one way or another, the applicant could have and should have initiated a civil proceedings against Investbank as a defendant, thus accepting that this private law remedy would have been successful in resolving the applicant's grievances before the courts in Serbia.

<<4467.33;4488.55;en>>
The same position was undertaken by the Government of Slovenia, which argued that the applicant had a possibility and should have initiated proceedings against Ljubljana or Republic of Slovenia in respect of their claims as an effective remedy before the courts in Slovenia.

<<4488.55;4497.73;en>>
In addition, the Slovenian Government supported this argument by relying on judgments in that direction brought by the domestic courts.

<<4497.73;4504.91;en>>
Today's arguments of the Croatian and Bosnian Governments confirm the same line of reasoning.

<<4504.91;4511.65;en>>
Mr. President, establishing its stance that the relationship at dispute in this case is

<<4511.65;4530.41;en>>
one of an inherently private law character between the banks and the applicants, the Government argues that the applications are inadmissible concerning the Republic of Macedonia both on Racione LOKI and on Racione Personae grounds.

<<4530.41;4543.41;en>>
Compatibility Racione Personae requires the alleged violation of the Convention to have been committed by a contracting state or to be in some way attributable to it.

<<4543.41;4558.37;en>>
From the facts of the case, it arises that the applicants deposited a foreign currency in the then Ljubljanska Bank Sarajevo and an Investbank Tuzla branch office, both situated in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<<4558.37;4574.65;en>>
As it is clear from the facts of the case and according to the Government of Slovenia, the liability for Ljubljanska Bank Sarajevo is retained by the so-called Old Ljubljanska Banka, in which Republic of Slovenia appears to be the sole owner.

<<4574.65;4597.61;en>>
Also, in view of Investbank, it is undoubtedly determined that it remained liable for the savings deposited in its branch offices until 2002, when it went into bankruptcy, after which the guarantee of the Republic of Serbia was activated in view of the old savings deposited in the bank.

<<4597.61;4622.37;en>>
Hence it is undisputed that the Republic of Macedonia or any institution or body for which the Republic of Macedonia is to be held accountable or to which it transferred public mandates has any connection with the application, the applicants, the banks, their headquarters or branches or the applicants' allegations in question.

<<4622.37;4643.69;en>>
Nor are the applicants in a position to be able to claim the status of a victim of a violation of a right guaranteed by the Convention, which would imply that they may claim to be directly affected by a certain measure or an event caused by a body exercising authority in the name of the Government of Macedonia.

<<4643.69;4658.01;en>>
Since it is uncontested that the applicants' deposits have been made on Bosnian territory, the Government considers that this application is inadmissible ratione loci with regard to the Republic of Macedonia as well.

<<4658.01;4679.29;en>>
Finally the Government would like to point out that the Macedonian Government took responsibility for the old foreign currency debt deposited in all Macedonian banks and their branches, as well as branches of foreign banks operating on Macedonian territory, regardless of nationality of the depositor.

<<4679.29;4692.75;en>>
This far-reaching law was enacted in 2000 and successfully ceased to exist in 2012, when all the savers were reimbursed in total with the accumulated interest.

<<4692.75;4707.69;en>>
It is clear that the applicants did not fulfill the conditions prescribed by this law, since they had deposited their savings in banks outside the territory of the Republic of Macedonia.

<<4707.69;4713.21;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court, we believe that we have demonstrated

<<4713.21;4730.13;en>>
that the application in front of us today is to be declared inadmissible in respect of the Republic of Macedonia on ratione loci and ratione persona grounds, due to the inherently private law character between the banks and the applicants.

<<4730.13;4755.93;en>>
In addition, we believe that the present case is suitable for the adoption of a pilot judgment in respect of those applicants who had so-called old foreign currency savings deposits in Ljubljana's Habank Sarajevo or Investbank Tuzla, and whose savings deposits thereby were not taken on as public debt by any of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia.

<<4755.93;4755.93;en>>
I thank you for your attention.

<<4760.17;4763.03;en>>
Thank you Mr Bogdanov, thank you for your interventions.

<<4763.03;4772.99;en>>
I would now like to invite the judges of the Grand Chamber to put any questions they may have to the parties.

<<4772.99;4773.99;en>>
Judge Sicilianos.

[[Judge;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<4781.6;4792.1;en>>
President, I have three questions, the first of them to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<<4792.1;4816.96;en>>
According to Serbia, Serbia and Slovenia referred to the 1997 act by which Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I quote, effectively acknowledged its liability for the contested savings, thereby creating a reasonable expectation on the part of the savers that they would recover their savings.

<<4816.96;4821.58;en>>
Could you please comment on this legislation?

<<4821.58;4846.62;en>>
To the Serbian government, Bosnia and Herzegovina referred to the 1998 Foreign Currency Savings Act and to the 2002 Public Debt Act, supporting, according to Bosnia, the position that by those two acts, you interfered with the savings of the applicants.

<<4846.62;4850.44;en>>
Could you please elaborate on those acts?

<<4850.44;4854.62;en>>
And finally, my third question goes to Slovenia.

<<4854.62;4869.88;en>>
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia referred to a series of judgments by Slovenian courts, including the Supreme Court of Slovenia, ruling in substance in favor of the applicants' legal positions.

<<4869.88;4873.38;en>>
Could you please comment on those judgments?

<<4873.38;4873.38;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4875.85;4878.85;en>>
Thank you, Judge Ziemele.

[[Judge;Ineta Ziemele]]

<<4883.83;4885.43;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4885.43;4895.41;en>>
I have a general question to all of the respondent states, with the exception of Macedonia.

<<4895.41;4919.93;en>>
I note in our file and also as just explained by the Macedonian agent, that there was a possibility to acknowledge the liability over the deposits made in the territory of, in this case, Macedonia with the Macedonian banks.

<<4919.93;4945.61;en>>
So the point of departure to my question to the other respondents is, given the example of one of the respondent states, would you sum up in a nutshell why in relation to the others, probably to a lesser degree, I would say, Croatia, why in relation to the other respondent states this was not considered and was not a possibility?

<<4945.61;4958.97;en>>
And there I go back to Judge Sicilianos question in relation to Bosnia-Herzegovina, why there was a retraction of what seemed to be the earlier position similar to that to Republic of Macedonia.

<<4958.97;4958.97;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4961.81;4963.61;en>>
Thank you, Judge Nußberger.

[[Judge;Angelika Nußberger]]

<<4967.17;4968.17;en>>
Yes, thank you.

<<4968.17;4975.77;en>>
I would have three questions, two questions to all the governments and one question to Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<<4975.77;5005.53;en>>
So the question to Bosnia-Herzegovina would be, is it true that in 1993 LB Sarajevo was registered in the company registry and that it was mentioned that the assets, rights and obligations of the LB main branch Sarajevo as the legal predecessor passed over to Ljubljana's Banka Sarajevo as the legal successor?

<<5005.53;5009.85;en>>
Was it true and what was the meaning of this registration?

<<5009.85;5029.53;en>>
And then to all the governments, for me it's still unclear when, by whom and with which explanation the decision was taken to freeze the accounts and what was exactly meant legally speaking by freezing.

<<5029.53;5045.13;en>>
And the last question to all the governments, what were the necessary and at the same time the sufficient conditions respectively for your governments to restart negotiations and to bring them to a result acceptable by all?

<<5045.13;5045.13;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5047.55;5048.27;en>>
Thank you, judge Turković.

[[Judge;Ksenija Turković]]

<<5059.62;5063.77;en>>
One is going to the government of Slovenia, but if others know, they might help.

<<5064.44;5073.31;en>>
We heard about the Constitutional Act of 1994 and that the assets were transferred from the old Ljubljanska Banka to new Ljubljanska Banka.

<<5073.31;5078.53;en>>
I assume it must be known how much of the assets were transferred.

<<5078.53;5081.55;en>>
So this is one question.

<<5081.55;5088.85;en>>
And the other question is related as well to the negotiations and NXC.

<<5088.85;5097.15;en>>
Could you explain how do you understand what is the matter of negotiations according to the NXC?

<<5097.15;5098.66;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5099.68;5100.28;en>>
Thank you.

<<5102.64;5104.68;en>>

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<5219.0;5220.36;en>>
Yes, thank you.

<<5218.0;5232.98;ru>>
Я сам пажливо заслушал отговоры всех представников противника Африканата и желаю сказать следующее.

<<5232.98;5255.0;ru>>
Мы потеряли вид, что люди, которые были уничтожены, уничтожены с самым тяжелым проблемой, в самом деле люди, которые сейчас находятся в пенсии, перед пенсией и на границе страдания, которые не могут доходить до своих денег через 20 лет.

<<5255.0;5258.0;ru>>
Все мои африканцы живут и работают на территории Немецкой.

<<5258.0;5262.0;ru>>
Я прошу суда, чтобы в данный момент, в случае принятия решения, вводил в свои деньги.

<<5262.0;5280.5;ru>>
Противники Африканцы, однако, и их представители, больше всего занимаются, в большинстве случаев, работают на транзакции денег между банками, создание банковских статусов, изменение статусов и так далее.

<<5280.5;5293.9;ru>>
Мы считаем, что, хотя суд на этом уровне очень много труда вложил, но это не от большой правильной важности для решения этого вопроса и следующих вопросов.

<<5293.9;5307.5;ru>>
Когда счетчик принесет деньги в банк, передает их на шальтер, принимает печать и подписку о владении и передает банку деньги на дальнейшую работу с деньгами.

<<5307.5;5312.5;ru>>
Ему не известно, что дальше происходит с его деньгами.

<<5312.5;5331.5;ru>>
Сколько из них остается в банке, в которой он передал деньги, сколько из них уходит в его материальную банку, или какой деньги он завершает в Народной банке Югославии, в ответ на кредиты, которые она дала в динарии.

<<5331.5;5350.5;ru>>
За счетчиком в ответственности стоит банка, в которой деньги положены, и ее материальная банка, то есть гарантия всех девизных и счетчатых улогов, была страна Югославии.

<<5350.5;5361.7;ru>>
Второе. Никто из противников аппликации не задумывался о вопросах с поразомом о сукцесе владения Югославии,

<<5361.7;5368.8;ru>>
заключенных между государственными наследницами в Бече 29 июня 2001 года.

<<5368.8;5377.8;ru>>
Представитель Сербии занимается тем, что это ли приватные права и владения, или это вопрос финансовых долгов и поисковых работ в Югославии.

<<5377.8;5396.8;ru>>
Для нас, от правооценного значения следующее, из поразома о сукцесе, можно сказать, что государственные наследницы гарантии бывшей Югославии признали как дух бывшей Югославии.

<<5396.8;5405.8;ru>>
И второе. Из того же пораза о сукцесе видно, что после распада бывшей Югославии

<<5405.8;5446.8;ru>>
владельцы власти, которые находятся в неоткрытках дипломатического консуларного имузиа, золота, девизов, других премиум металлов, артиодредности, поисковых работ и так далее, и что государственные наследницы поделили и перенесли в поселок и свободное располагание, и работали этим имуществом.

<<5446.8;5455.8;ru>>
И что здесь происходит, значит, о вкладах в странную валюту. Не проходит это в домашнюю валюту, которая временно потеряла власть на власть в инфляции.

<<5455.8;5473.3;ru>>
После диссолюции бывшей Югославии и заключения с поразом о сукцесе, государственные наследницы различно приступают к решению этого проблемы и осваивают различные критерии при власти.

<<5473.3;5492.8;ru>>
Это может быть государственные граждане, территория государства, на которой находится валюта, без взгляда на филиалы, или материальная филиалка, так называемая матер-банк, филиалы, на которой находится валюта.

<<5492.8;5515.3;ru>>
Мы понимаем, что суд в этот момент, в данном случае, делал то, что было возможно, из всей этой шума правительства и поступков и действий, чтобы принять решение в таком или ином виде. Суд право, релевантно, не имел другой возможности, это мое мнение.

<<5515.3;5533.8;ru>>
Поэтому я считаю, что суд в данном случае был бы подобным, чтобы он был пилотом суда.

<<5533.8;5546.3;ru>>
Другие заявления, которые я слышал, за которые я здесь объявлял, что они были направлены, я считаю, что они не имеют правильного значения, что они не основаны. Ещё могу, единственное, вернуться к инвестбанку.

<<5546.3;5552.0;ru>>
Знакомо, что инвестбанка имела свои филиалы на территории Республики Боснии и Херцеговины.

<<5552.0;5558.8;ru>>
Инвестбанка была взята в 2002 году, то есть республика Сербия начала срочность над этой банкой.

<<5558.8;5563.8;ru>>
Это единственный случай, где активирована гарантия над банкой, гарантия государства.

<<5563.8;5570.8;ru>>
Это единственный случай, в предыдущем случае Штепс не мог активировать гарантию, это уже известно и сказано.

<<5570.8;5584.8;ru>>
И суд правильно утвердил, что большинство денег, которые были положены в инвестбанке в Боснии и Херцеговине, завершили в инвестбанке в Сербии. Суд правильно утвердил, что Сербия начала срочность над этой банкой,

<<5584.8;5590.8;ru>>
после продажи имузии этой банки, взяла эту имузию. И суд правильно утвердил, что давал один дело денег,

<<5590.8;5610.3;ru>>
как кредит Боснии и Херцеговине за эти девизы, которые из инвестбанка ушли в инвестбанку в Сербии, но это были девизы в скаме, динари в скаме, которые в среду, они должны были вернуть инфляцию, эту власть, которую она получила. Просто эта власть умерла.

<<5610.3;5634.8;ru>>
В конце, еще раз, я хочу попросить суда, при ображении и обоснованных прошиваниях, великолепно, вводи рачуна, что в междувременном куповная мощь денег изумительно упала, что люди, конечно, обстреляны протоком времени, и если не получат нематериальное обстрелы и кометы, тогда это было бы дополнительное обстрел, которое неудобные терпители, в любом начале, скрывали и довели до такой ситуации.

When it comes to the question of Mr. Siciliano,

<<5666.86;5676.66;en>>
this is a very interesting question, and I'm thankful to have the opportunity to explain this, because it was in my oral pleading, but I didn't have time.

<<5676.66;5696.26;en>>
When it comes to the privatizations of the banks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, neither Bosnia-Herzegovina nor her entities ever assumed liability for all foreign currency savings deposited in foreign banks.

<<5696.26;5712.38;en>>
So framework law on privatizations on banks and enterprises, by this law, Bosnia-Herzegovina authorized its entities to privatize the state-owned banks.

<<5712.38;5718.3;en>>
So only state-owned banks were the subject of the privatization process.

<<5718.3;5730.9;en>>
Slovenian Bank, Ljubljana Bank, and Serbian Invest Bank are foreign banks, and these banks were never under jurisdiction of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<<5730.9;5741.94;en>>
So neither Bosnia-Herzegovina nor her entities have ever assumed liability for the debts of foreign banks.

<<5741.94;5773.3;en>>
On the other hand, after these entity laws on ways and methods of payment of all foreign currency savings were declared unconstitutional, in 2006, Bosnia-Herzegovina adopted All Foreign Currency Savings Act and undertook to pay savings to all depositors who had savings in domestic banks, banks of Bosnia-Herzegovina, without any difference on any ground.

<<5773.3;5790.3;en>>
And I would also like to underline that this law was evaluated by the court and declared to be in accordance with Article 1 or Protocol 1 in the pilot judgment in the case Vujagic versus Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<<5790.3;5797.78;en>>
So the point is, foreign banks like Ljubljana Bank and Invest Bank were never subject of privatization in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<<5797.78;5806.86;en>>
Thus, Bosnia-Herzegovina nor her entities ever assumed liabilities for all foreign currency savings from these banks.

<<5806.86;5812.7;en>>
That's why applicants never had hoped that Bosnia-Herzegovina would return their savings.

<<5812.7;5836.78;en>>
And how could Bosnia-Herzegovina assume liability for current currency savings deposited in Ljubljana Bank when constitutional act of Slovenia in 1994 confirmed that Ljubljana Bank is liable for the savings deposited in its branches?

<<5836.78;5844.1;en>>
I hope I explained this situation.

<<5844.1;5858.02;en>>
When it comes to the second question, if I rightly understood you, the question is, why other states did not follow the positive example of Croatia and Macedonia?

<<5858.02;5862.46;en>>
Well, I'll explain these reasons for Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<<5862.46;5872.98;en>>
Bosnia-Herzegovina had bloody war and was completely destructed in the war, unlike other countries, especially Slovenia and Serbia.

<<5872.98;5875.82;en>>
They were intact by war.

<<5875.82;5883.5;en>>
So we had our own big financial, political, and social issues to solve after the war.

<<5883.5;5889.14;en>>
So we also had a huge problem with savings deposited in our domestic bank.

<<5889.14;5897.22;en>>
As I just said in privatization process, the state assumed liability from the banks for all foreign currency savings.

<<5897.22;5906.58;en>>
So the debt arising from all foreign currency savings deposited in Bosnia and Herzegovina and domestic bank was $2 billion.

<<5906.58;5909.82;en>>
And that was a huge problem for Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<<5909.82;5911.82;en>>
But at the end, we have succeeded.

<<5914.62;5917.7;en>>
And we repaid this all foreign currency savings.

<<5917.7;5928.7;en>>
And the court in the case Soljegic versus Bosnia-Herzegovina established that this law was in accordance with the convention.

<<5928.7;5935.78;en>>
So for years, we have been resolving the issue of domestic banks and all foreign currency savings in domestic.

<<5935.78;5946.94;en>>
So there was no possibility in Bosnia-Herzegovina that we could have assumed a debt of a foreign bank financed by the deposit of our people.

<<5946.94;5952.3;en>>
No logic, no legal ground, and no factual possibility.

<<5952.3;5966.14;en>>
When it comes to the third question, yes, it is true that main branch was transferred during the war in 1993 in Ljubljana's bank, the DD Sarajevo.

<<5966.14;5973.34;en>>
But this court registration was without no legal effect.

<<5973.34;5977.3;en>>
And this was confirmed by Slovenian courts.

<<5977.3;6001.46;en>>
I mean, this bank was erased from the register in Bosnia-Herzegovina after the decision of municipal court of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2004 when Bosnian court established that this bank was not a legal successor of main branch of Ljubljana's bank in Sarajevo.

<<6001.46;6008.3;en>>
But the Slovenian court, by its final judgment, explained it very well.

<<6008.3;6015.0;en>>
That's why I will answer your question by the position of Slovenian court.

<<6015.0;6035.54;en>>
With regard to this question, the Slovenian court said a branch office of a bank is not an independent legal entity and cannot decide on its destiny alone without the main bank, nor it can transfer any assets which are essentially the property of the bank.

<<6035.54;6044.02;en>>
So this transformation which took place during the war was without any legal effect.

<<6044.02;6050.42;en>>
So there is no legal successor of Ljubljana's bank in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<<6050.42;6069.26;en>>
And when it comes to the fourth question, so the subject of annexe of succession agreement in general is financial liabilities and assets of former Yugoslavia.

<<6069.26;6077.82;en>>
Unfortunately, the Article 7 of Annexe does not contain financial liability of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<<6077.82;6099.28;en>>
Article 7 of Annexe prescribes that guarantees of former Yugoslavia for all foreign currency savings will be negotiated without delay, especially taking into account protection of private savers.

<<6099.28;6113.7;en>>
So this article makes a distinction between guarantees of former Yugoslavia for all currency savings and individual savings.

<<6113.7;6128.18;en>>
These guarantees of former Yugoslavia were never activated before the solution of Yugoslavia because neither Ljubljana's bank or Inres Bank were insolvent.

<<6128.18;6133.1;en>>
So they never requested the activation of these guarantees.

<<6133.1;6144.58;en>>
So the subject of Article 7 of Annexe is non-existing, not activated financial liability of former Yugoslavia.

<<6144.58;6159.42;en>>
But on the other hand, we have the savings of the applicants, which is private property protected additionally by Annexe G of the agreement of the succession.

<<6159.42;6161.96;en>>
So I hope I have answered your questions.

<<6161.96;6171.94;en>>
And now I would like to use the rest of the time to reply to, of course, Slovenian and Serbian government.

<<6171.94;6177.34;en>>
I fully support the Croatian position and Macedonian position.

<<6177.34;6188.1;en>>
So among five successor states, there are three states which have the same reasonings and the same arguments.

<<6188.1;6201.82;en>>
I would like also to emphasize that under the same, we have proven to the court that all deposits collected in Bosnia-Herzegovina was regularly shipped to Slovenia.

<<6201.82;6204.38;en>>
The same situation was with Inres Bank.

<<6204.38;6207.58;en>>
Inres Bank was basic bank.

<<6207.58;6214.1;en>>
And Tuzla branch was always branch office in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<<6214.1;6229.34;en>>
So under the same legislation of former Yugoslavia, the deposits from Tuzla branch were regularly shipped to National Bank of Yugoslavia, to Serbia.

<<6229.34;6247.98;en>>
But unfortunately, all documentation concerning this transfer of the money is kept in Serbia in deposit insurance agency, which is bankruptcy manager of Inres Bank.

<<6247.98;6261.86;en>>
Also, the documentation that was situated in Bosnia-Herzegovina in this branch office of Inres Bank was stolen when Serbia sold premises in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Ms. Mijić, may I draw your attention that your time has just expired, so concentrate on the most important issues you want to raise.

[[Government;GR5]]

<<6272.59;6273.59;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<6267.87;6270.67;en>>
on the most important issues you want to raise.

<<6273.87;6295.39;en>>
I — when it comes to Slovenian arguments, I would just like to remind the Court that all arguments of Republic of Slovenia presented before this Court were rejected as ill-founded by Slovenian courts, by numerous judgments of final Slovenian courts.

<<6295.39;6298.59;en>>
So I have nothing further to add to this.

<<6298.59;6298.59;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<6299.64;6301.28;en>>
Thank you very much, Miss Mijić.

<<6301.28;6302.96;en>>
I call Miss Stažnik, please.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<6305.68;6309.06;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<6309.06;6333.28;en>>
As regards a question of Judge Angelika Nussberger, if I pronounced correctly, decisions of ex-Yugoslavia in 1990 and 1991 only suspended rights of applicant to freely and fully enjoy their deposits.

<<6333.28;6349.2;en>>
The interference in their right to peacefully enjoy their possessions happened in 1994, when the Republic of Slovenia enacted constitutional law, leaving the only one liable for payment of applicant's deposits, Elbede de Ljubljana, without any assets.

<<6349.2;6355.72;en>>
Therefore, from 1994, the applicants had no legal way to get their deposits back.

<<6355.72;6375.24;en>>
The mentioned decision of SFRAJ, legal act decision of SFRAJ, stipulated that households could freely and immediately dispose of any those funds in their foreign exchange accounts that had been deposited after 27th April of 1991.

<<6375.24;6393.88;en>>
All funds, so those deposited in foreign exchange accounts with banks prior to 27th April of 1991, could be withdrawn and used only if advance notice was given from 27 to 180 days before execution order.

<<6393.88;6416.84;en>>
Then, we saw that legal remedies existed for this decision to be challenged, and it is important that Constitutional Court of ex-Yugoslavia in 1992 declared unconstitutional this legal decision because it restricted savers in free disposal of their deposit.

<<6416.84;6425.72;en>>
I mention it restricted, not prevented them to dispose of their foreign currency savings.

<<6425.72;6445.4;en>>
As to the question of Judge Zimel, I would like to say that Croatia resolved the question of all foreign currency savings with regard to banks having headquarters in Croatia without any discrimination.

<<6445.4;6462.4;en>>
In addition, as an interim measure aimed at protecting interest of savers, Croatia also enabled the transfer of all foreign currency deposits from the branches of foreign banks in Croatia to Croatia's banks.

<<6462.4;6475.88;en>>
Croatia had resolved the question of the all foreign currency savings of banks having headquarters in Croatia, so-called Croatian banks, by its own legislation in 1991.

<<6475.88;6487.76;en>>
We enabled Croatian banks to pay out all its savers for their foreign currency deposits regardless of their citizenship or the place where the savings were deposited.

<<6487.76;6494.8;en>>
This was enabled by conversation of all foreign currency savings into the public debt.

<<6494.8;6507.32;en>>
The savers in Croatian bank could withdraw their savings within 10 years in 20 semi-annual installments with 5% of interest.

<<6507.32;6524.6;en>>
In addition, Croatia enabled transfer of all foreign currency savings from the branches of banks headquartered outside the Croatian territory, such as Ljubljanska Bank, meaning from the branch of Ljubljanska Bank in Zagreb.

<<6524.6;6533.76;en>>
And we enabled those savers to transfer their savings to any of Croatian banks.

<<6533.76;6540.44;en>>
These transferred savings became also part of the Croatian public debt.

<<6540.44;6552.88;en>>
After transferring their deposits, savers could withdraw their savings with Croatian banks in the same way and in the same manner as the savers of Croatian banks.

<<6552.88;6564.99;en>>
The transfer was made on the basis of saving account book with a foreign bank, meaning Ljubljanska Bank, and the statement of the saver that he wished to make that transfer.

<<6564.99;6575.48;en>>
Additionally, the savers would make a statement assigning his or her claim towards the foreign-based bank to the Croatian bank.

<<6575.48;6585.48;en>>
Croatian bank to which the deposit was assigned would then inform the foreign bank in which deposit was originally made.

<<6585.48;6593.6;en>>
So Ljubljanska Bank actively participated in the transfer of foreign currency savings into Croatian bank.

<<6593.6;6606.52;en>>
The director of the main branch Zagreb, who was appointed from Ljubljana, signed records confirming that the transferred amount was in line with records of Ljubljanska Bank.

<<6606.52;6621.12;en>>
So Ljubljanska Bank and the saver and Croatian banks, they all knew exactly what amount was transferred, and it was transferred with full knowledge of Ljubljanska Bank.

<<6621.12;6632.72;en>>
Later, the Croatian banks assigned their claims towards foreign-based banks to the Republic of Croatia since it was assumed into its public debt.

<<6632.72;6644.68;en>>
By virtue of this assignment, the Republic of Croatia became creditor of Ljubljanska Bank with regard to this portion of transferred foreign currency savings.

<<6644.68;6653.56;en>>
So Croatia became basically the creditor of Ljubljanska Bank for those transferred currency savings.

<<6653.56;6658.84;en>>
At that point, I would stop and give the floor to my colleague to answer other questions.

<<6658.84;6658.84;en>>
Thank you.

[[Government;GR4]]

<<6668.04;6681.32;en>>
Respected President of the Court and the judges of the Green Chamber, I would address here the question related to the alleged succession issue.

<<6681.32;6708.76;en>>
I would like to confirm that the case before you has nothing to do with the succession of the former Yugoslavia and that the negotiations that have been dealt and done among the successor states on the basis of the succession agreement do not have any relevance in the case before us.

<<6708.76;6756.12;en>>
Namely, neither international law as such on succession of states, as formulated in the customary international law or as more or less codified in the two conventions on the succession of states, as well as 2001 agreement on the succession of former Yugoslavia, do not offer any legal basis to consider that the old foreign currency savings deposited in the commercial banks as such should be part of the financial liabilities of the former state and in any way be addressed within the succession issue.

<<6756.12;6781.8;en>>
It is the truth that the agreement on succession provides in Article 7 of Annex C for negotiations, and those are negotiations with regards to the guarantees of the former state, and the article itself does not provide what should be the result of those negotiations.

<<6781.8;6785.36;en>>
Should those negotiations be divided?

<<6785.36;6795.12;en>>
Should each successor state simply assume the guarantees or provide protection for its banks?

<<6795.12;6801.32;en>>
No, we will not find any solution in this agreement.

<<6801.32;6808.8;en>>
Therefore, the successor states entered in the multilateral negotiations under the auspices of BIS.

<<6808.8;6813.32;en>>
But those negotiations never ended with any success.

<<6813.32;6852.8;en>>
Namely, we believe that Slovenia and Serbia impartially did not negotiate in good faith during those negotiations, and what they did, they actually insisted on the principle of territoriality, which they continue to claim here before this court in order to exclude themselves for the liability of their banks for the branches and the deposits they collected through those branches in other republics of the former Yugoslavia.

<<6852.8;6855.84;en>>
What should be the end result of these negotiations?

<<6855.84;6867.56;en>>
Well, the end result should be that the foreign currency deposits get protected, and that individuals should get protection they deserve.

<<6867.56;6887.52;en>>
And we believe that no negotiations among the successor states can offer that kind of result, and that it is the court in this case which is the right place where those individuals and their foreign currency deposit should be protected.

<<6887.52;6892.6;en>>
And this would be the aim which would then satisfy them.

<<6892.6;6901.4;en>>
Let me just draw the attention to the Memorandum of Understanding which Croatia and Slovenia have recently signed.

<<6901.4;6912.08;en>>
This memorandum cannot be and should not be regarded as some kind of proof that Croatia regards the issue of foreign currency deposits as a matter of succession.

<<6912.08;6939.4;en>>
I would say on the contrary, this Memorandum of Understanding is a living proof that Croatia and Slovenia are ready to further negotiate on the transferred foreign currency savings, and that is the currency savings which Croatia as an interim measure repaid for the foreign currency deposits of Ljubljana's bank in Croatia.

<<6939.4;6964.6;en>>
And this memorandum clearly states that this is exclusively the issue which will be discussed, and we used the Agreement on Succession of Yugoslavia and its mode of settlement which provides for negotiations within the BIS as a good tool for our bilateral negotiations as well.

<<6964.6;6985.88;en>>
And this is why Croatia and Slovenia jointly sent a letter inviting BIS to involve and to act in one and somehow as a facilitator in our bilateral talks, which exclusively on the transferred foreign currency savings.

<<6985.88;7012.76;en>>
And we believe that this is the right way because MOU as is, is a living proof that Slovenia is also aware the fact that Croatia paid out foreign currency deposits, deposited in the Croatian branch of Ljubljana's bank is not sustainable, and that this is something which both states should negotiate further in order to settle this issue in the right way.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<7016.45;7019.09;en>>
Thank you very much. I call Mr. Carić.

[[Government;GR6]]

<<7024.16;7026.16;en>>
Thank you Mr. President, Honorable Judges.

<<7026.16;7030.96;en>>
Let me start by answering to the question of Honorable Judge Sicilianos.

<<7030.96;7044.04;en>>
By the 1998 Act, Serbia recognized foreign currency savings as public debt regardless whatever savings were deposited with the bank or with its branch offices.

<<7044.04;7051.2;en>>
Citizens with residence in former republics could have claimed their rights under the conditions of reciprocity.

<<7051.2;7063.76;en>>
Later by the Act on Public Debt adopted in 2002, citizens of former Yugoslav republics were prevented to withdraw their savings deposited with the branch offices in the territories of the former republics.

<<7063.76;7077.32;en>>
These limitations contained in the Act of 2002 concerning the citizens of former Yugoslav republics were in accordance with the already ratified Agreement on Succession before the adoption of the above-mentioned Act from 2002.

<<7077.32;7084.86;en>>
With full respect of Ms. Mijic, I have to say that what she said recently is not true.

<<7084.86;7092.32;en>>
The law explicitly referred also to 1997 business units with a seat in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<<7092.32;7097.12;en>>
The Investbanka and Ljubljanska Banka have not been excluded from this law.

<<7097.12;7106.24;en>>
It is well known that the government bonds issued on this ground were used in purchasing apartments or in process of privatization.

<<7106.24;7126.32;en>>
With regard to the question of Honorable Judge Zimele, I would like to say that in this agreement signed in 2001, in Article 7 of Annex C, foreign currency savings are explicitly included as a part of public debt and they should be settled through negotiations.

<<7126.32;7140.68;en>>
That was the reason for the adoption of territorial principle in the 2002 Act, as the territorial principle is the main principle governing succession.

<<7140.68;7145.76;en>>
If all the states would apply it, all the savers would recover their savings.

<<7145.76;7153.02;en>>
Unwillingness of some states to apply this principle created the situation such as of the applicants.

<<7153.02;7165.32;en>>
With regard to the question of Honorable Judge Nussberger, I would like to say in regard to the freezing of funds, it started in the end of 1990 by banks.

<<7165.32;7170.0;en>>
Afterwards, the federal government made limitations in payment of savings.

<<7170.0;7175.04;en>>
Subsequently, the payment of savings were not affected due to lack of funds.

<<7175.04;7181.74;en>>
Also I would like to say that the continuation of the negotiation depend on the willingness of the parties to do so.

<<7181.74;7188.88;en>>
As we explained earlier, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia obstructed constantly the negotiation process.

<<7188.88;7201.28;en>>
With regard to the question of Honorable Judge Turkovic, I would like to say that under Article 2 Annex C, Agreement of Succession, the states are responsible to negotiate about protection of foreign currency savings.

<<7201.28;7215.72;en>>
Further, Article 7 of Annex C prescribed that the guarantees shall be subject to negotiation to be held under the auspices of the Bank of International Settlements for the sake of the protection of the foreign currency savings deposits.

<<7215.72;7226.12;en>>
With regard to the allegation of Ms. Meech, concerning the activation of guarantees of

<<7226.12;7230.34;en>>
former Yugoslavia, I would like to say that the savings became public debt.

<<7230.34;7245.88;en>>
The guarantees of the SFRY were included in the Annex C, even though they were never activated, even though they could have later been activated as SFRY no longer existed.

<<7245.88;7254.74;en>>
But they nevertheless were included in Annex C, bringing thus foreign currency savings within its scope.

<<7254.74;7261.4;en>>
I would like to say something and to elaborate something concerning already mentioned bankruptcy proceedings.

<<7261.4;7269.38;en>>
Bankruptcy proceedings of Invasbanka were initiated by the decision of the commercial court in Belgrade on 3 January 2002.

<<7269.38;7285.22;en>>
The decisions of the commercial court in Belgrade adopted later in the course of bankruptcy proceedings in respect of the sale of Invasbanka property were recognized by the decision of cantonal court in Sarajevo of 13 December 2006.

<<7285.22;7291.82;en>>
This fact shows that the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina were fully aware of it and agreed with the sale.

<<7291.82;7300.5;en>>
Besides, the very sale of property has nothing to do with the foreign currency deposits spent before 1990s.

<<7300.5;7307.26;en>>
Even more, all foreign currency deposits were recognized as public debt in all successor states.

<<7307.26;7311.58;en>>
Consequently, this issue should be further negotiated between the successor states.

<<7311.58;7315.82;en>>
However, the negotiations were blocked by Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<<7315.82;7324.24;en>>
Concerning the alleged obligation of Serbia to initiate cross-border bankruptcy proceedings, such an obligation for Serbia had not existed at the relevant time.

<<7324.24;7327.18;en>>
It was mentioned in the observation of the Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<<7327.18;7333.06;en>>
It was up to creditors in Bosnia and Herzegovina to request opening of the cross-border bankruptcy.

<<7333.06;7337.54;en>>
However, after the above-mentioned Bosnian court decision, it was not possible.

<<7337.54;7342.18;en>>
It was decision of the cantonal court in Sarajevo of 13 December 2006.

<<7342.18;7351.02;en>>
At the end, it should be noted that the European Convention on Certain International Aspects of Bankruptcy, Istanbul Convention, has not been ratified by Serbia.

<<7351.02;7368.98;en>>
With regard to the question of discrimination, in respect of this issue, it should be reiterated that Serbian regulation on all foreign currency savings are known to the court, as in the case Molnar-Gabor v. Serbia, wherein prescribed limitations were declared legitimate.

<<7368.98;7377.02;en>>
On the other hand, by its internal regulation, Bosnia and Herzegovina enabled the savers to have legitimate expectation until 2006.

<<7377.02;7390.6;en>>
Firstly, under the 2002 Act, the rights of savers from other former republics were limited, as well as the rights of Serbian savers to the deposit with the banks in other former Yugoslav republics.

<<7390.6;7395.42;en>>
This limitation was legitimate because of the succession negotiation in progress.

<<7395.42;7404.7;en>>
Accordingly, the citizens of Serbia, foreign currency savers, could not recover their savings in the course of bankruptcy proceedings on the invest bank as well.

<<7404.7;7423.4;en>>
With regard to the mention of the decision in the Shekerovich case, I would like to say that it was a decision adopted before the legislation of 1999 and 2002.

<<7423.4;7431.34;en>>
So Mr. Shekerovich can also use the opportunity to withdraw some of his savings in 1994

<<7431.34;7437.58;en>>
or 1995, as it was done by Mr. Shekerovich in this decision.

<<7437.58;7441.54;en>>
He was not denied the right to do so.

<<7441.54;7448.7;en>>
On the contrary, the courts in Serbia ruled in the favor of Mr. Shekerovich.

<<7448.7;7459.32;en>>
But this case, there is no connection with this case and the legislation of 1999 and 2002.

<<7459.32;7480.28;en>>
With regard to the Slovenian allegation concerning the transfer of deposits of the foreign currency savings to the accounts of National Bank of Yugoslavia abroad, it is important to say that it concerned only 14% of the total amounts of deposits.

<<7480.28;7482.34;en>>
The rest was the pro forma deposition.

<<7482.34;7487.38;en>>
I would like to explain this very complicated process of pro forma deposition.

<<7487.38;7496.74;en>>
In case of pro forma deposition, a bank shall receive a dinner loan from the National Bank of Yugoslavia in the amount of counter value of foreign currency to be deposited.

<<7496.74;7501.42;en>>
However, the major portion of foreign currency has never actually been deposited.

<<7501.42;7507.64;en>>
Under the accounting procedure, the bank shall owe dinner loan to the National Bank in claim foreign currency.

<<7507.64;7513.3;en>>
Due to inflation, the dinner loan shall be devaluated, but foreign currency claim shall remain.

<<7513.3;7523.86;en>>
Practically, the bank shall have a foreign currency claim from the National Bank of Yugoslavia, although it had not deposited any funds with the National Bank of Yugoslavia.

<<7523.86;7536.74;en>>
Finally, let me notice that any simplification of this case will not contribute to the just solution of all foreign currency savings issue, but quite contrary.

<<7536.74;7545.82;en>>
As some governments notice, this is one kind of peace agreement between the states at stake.

<<7545.82;7553.34;en>>
It was born of contention, as Macedonian governments said in this case.

<<7553.34;7560.12;en>>
So any simplification of this issue will not contribute to resolution of this matter.

<<7560.12;7560.12;en>>
Thank you very much.

Thank you, Mr. Carić.

<<7565.85;7565.85;en>>
I call Ms. Annacker.

[[Government;GR3]]

<<7568.9;7571.26;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<7571.26;7580.1;en>>
I would first like to respond to Judge Siciliano's question on the Slovenian court proceedings.

<<7580.1;7592.1;en>>
I would first like to emphasize that if the applicants had brought a claim against Slovenianska Banka in the Slovenian courts, their claim would have been dismissed.

<<7592.1;7621.54;en>>
This is so because under Article 1044, paragraph 2 of the applicable SFRY 1978 Civil Obligations Act, the applicants must prove to a domestic court that they have a savings book, they must present a savings book with principal and interest that they claim established through entries authenticated with a bank stamp and a signature of an authorized person.

<<7621.54;7626.78;en>>
The applicants have not presented anything of the like in the present proceedings.

<<7626.78;7640.7;en>>
I draw, for example, the court's attention to Slovenia's Annex 64, which is a Slovenian court judgment that dismissed a claim that was not authenticated with a bank stamp and a signature.

<<7640.7;7647.7;en>>
So the applicants would not have been able to obtain a court judgment in their favor.

<<7647.7;7665.9;en>>
On the substance of the Slovenian court judgments, the Slovenian courts have never, in a single instance, held the Republic of Slovenia liable for deposits made in any of the successor states.

<<7665.9;7674.38;en>>
The critical question in this case, I would submit, is not so much whether Ljubljana's bank is liable.

<<7674.38;7677.18;en>>
Let us assume Ljubljana's bank is liable.

<<7677.18;7712.9;en>>
The Slovenian courts have assumed we are looking at the bank that is not in a position to repay foreign currency deposits unless it either has access to the assets of the MBY, about 75 percent of the bank's assets constitute a claim against the MBY, so these would be subject to division among the successor states under the rule of state succession, and Ljubljana's bank is receiving financial assistance by one of the respondent states.

<<7712.9;7734.9;en>>
Now, requiring one respondent state to take over debts for Ljubljana's bank with respect to foreign currency deposits would effectively make that state liable for the entirety of the debts of the bank that was subject to division among the successor states.

<<7734.9;7755.34;en>>
I submit that such an outcome would violate a fundamental rule of the rules of state succession, namely that the outcome of the distribution must be equitable.

<<7755.34;7766.66;en>>
I will now come back to Judge Nussberg's question on the freezing of the foreign currency deposits.

<<7766.66;7780.98;en>>
As explained by the government of Serbia, the SFRY imposed very severe restrictions on foreign currency deposits in late December 1990.

<<7780.98;7797.3;en>>
I refer to Slovenia's Annex I, the amendment of the Foreign Currency Transactions Act, Article 71, and the secondary legislation that implemented that article.

<<7797.3;7812.38;en>>
We had very severe restrictions imposed regarding the purposes of withdrawals, essentially only payments for imports of goods or services for personal use, foreign currency bonds, scientific or humanitarian purposes.

<<7812.38;7826.46;en>>
We had very significant restrictions on the sums that could be withdrawn and severe advance notice requirements.

<<7826.46;7841.02;en>>
On the conditions for negotiations to distribute the old foreign currency debt, I can represent on behalf of the Republic of Slovenia, the RANA.

<<7841.02;7856.98;en>>
Slovenia has at all times been willing to negotiate in accordance with its obligations under customary national law and Annex C, the distribution of the old foreign currency debt.

<<7856.98;7878.18;en>>
It suffices to take a quick look at Article 7 that the obligation to negotiate extends to any hard currency savings deposit in a commercial bank and any of its branches in any successor state.

<<7878.18;7895.58;en>>
So it is clear that the deposits at issue in these proceedings are covered, and there are no restrictions with respect to transferred foreign currency deposits or otherwise. Indeed, the position that there is nothing

<<7895.58;7900.1;en>>
to negotiate under Article 7 is bizarre.

<<7900.1;7903.5;en>>
Why was this article included in the first instance in Annex C?

<<7903.5;7916.1;en>>
Clearly, the successor states all believe there is something to negotiate, and they did negotiate pursuant to Annex C.

<<7916.1;7927.3;en>>
I will now address the question of the 1994 restructuring of Ljubljana's bank.

<<7927.3;7936.06;en>>
That restructuring was done pursuant to the territorial principle.

<<7936.06;7956.94;en>>
That means Slovenia transferred no assets in other successor states to NLBDD as is clearly reflected in the relevant financial documents before the Court. For example, the 1994 report on LBDD

<<7956.94;7975.02;en>>
Sarajevo's operations, Slovenia's Annex 116 with respect to LBDD Sarajevo, and the LB main branch SAGREP's 1994 balance sheet in Slovenia's chamber, Annex 112.

<<7975.02;7985.22;en>>
I would like to emphasize that Slovenia put Ljubljana's bank into rehabilitation. It put it into rehabilitation because it was on the

<<7985.22;7993.54;en>>
verge of bankruptcy, and it was not in a position to repay the foreign currency debt.

<<7993.54;8006.9;en>>
The restructuring and the rehabilitation and the following restructuring had the following effect. They left the deposits of

<<8006.9;8017.62;en>>
the applicants and others in their position in the status quo they were in before. They did not extend the financial assistance that

<<8017.62;8030.26;en>>
Slovenia had to provide to prevent the bankruptcy of Ljubljana's bank and the potential of a systemic crisis that that bankruptcy could have triggered.

<<8030.26;8050.5;en>>
I would like to point to a remarkably similar factual scenario, namely the restructuring of the Icelandic bank Landsbanki much more recently than the restructuring of Ljubljanska Banka. We have

<<8050.5;8063.26;en>>
included that restructuring and its remarkably similar factual scenario in paragraph 69 of Slovenia's observations to which I would refer to court.

<<8063.26;8087.42;en>>
And that restructuring, which also excluded branches in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, so branches outside the Icelandic territory, was recently reviewed by the aftercourt, and it was upheld as lawful under the EU deposit protection directives.

<<8087.42;8093.98;en>>
One last point on the MBY accounts abroad. I have drawn the court's

<<8093.98;8114.14;en>>
attention before to the relevant legislation that required the transfer of foreign currency cash deriving from deposits to MBY accounts abroad. And I would like to emphasize again this performer

<<8114.14;8126.94;en>>
or accounting method applied to the initial deposit, which was a huge sum, and that's why we have such big discrepancies in effective depositing and in performer depositing.

<<8126.94;8141.86;en>>
But after 1978, after the initial deposit was done, as can be very clearly seen from the contracts, from the legislation, foreign currency deposits had to be effectively redeposited.

<<8141.86;8146.46;en>>
That means they had to be shipped to MBY accounts abroad. And, of course,

<<8146.46;8151.3;en>>
we are not only talking about foreign currency deposits. Banks do have

<<8151.3;8157.26;en>>
other cash, foreign currency cash. So I would also like the court to focus

<<8157.26;8178.38;en>>
on the legislation that I have cited in my pleading that concerns foreign currency cash deriving from other sources, such as tourism or Yugoslav experts, substantial sources of foreign currency cash, which also had to be shipped to MBY accounts abroad.

<<8178.38;8178.38;en>>
That concludes my observations. Thank you, Mr. President.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<8182.93;8184.93;en>>

[[Government;GR1]]

<<8188.81;8192.13;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<8192.13;8207.61;en>>
Well, taking into account that we have already passed 12 o'clock and it's lunchtime, so to say, I will try to be, again, as short as possible in giving replies to the questions put by the judges.

<<8207.61;8221.69;en>>
I will start with the first question put by the judge, Nussberger, regarding the continuation of succession process and speeding up of that process.

<<8221.69;8240.57;en>>
From the part of the Republic of Macedonia, I can say that we believe that in this case, we are in the most unfavorable position of all the respondent states in the process of succession and all this whole issue regarding the old foreign currency savings.

<<8240.57;8256.35;en>>
Since the government, with the cited law before enacted in 2000, converted all the old foreign currency savings into public debt, regardless of nationality of the depositors or the banks.

<<8256.35;8276.29;en>>
In a sense, for us, the situation cannot be more disadvantaged than it is at the moment, because, as I referred in my pleading, the government took over the guarantees also for foreign branches which were operating on Macedonian territory.

<<8276.29;8308.21;en>>
Therefore, it is understandable that the government makes all the efforts that is within its competence to drive the succession process forward, and eventually, at the end, to be able to reimburse a part of the public debt deriving from the citizens' savings which were deposited in the branches of foreign banks, so to say in Macedonia, or banks which had headquarters in the other republics.

<<8308.21;8317.45;en>>
Regarding the question about the application of Annex C, I fully support and ally with the answer given by Monica, the government agent of Bosnia.

<<8317.45;8322.45;en>>
So I would not like to repeat myself on this issue.

<<8322.45;8341.65;en>>
And also, regarding the question about the freezing of assets of the depositors, I also fully agree with my Croatian colleague in her response regarding the legal basis which was actual in the then Yugoslavia.

<<8341.65;8364.53;en>>
But I would like to add that also Macedonia enacted a law for taking over the foreign currency deposits of the citizens by the Republic of Macedonia, which was enacted in 92, and also served as a legal basis for the freezing of the accounts of this type of depositors.

<<8364.53;8364.79;en>>
Thank you.

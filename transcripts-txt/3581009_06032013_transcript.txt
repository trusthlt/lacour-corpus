La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<51.97;56.29;en>>
Please be seated.

<<56.29;62.13;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of  O’Keeffe against Ireland.

<<62.13;72.21;en>>
The case was lodged with the court on the 16th of June 2009 under Article 34 of the Convention by an Irish national, Mrs. Louise O’Keeffe.

<<72.21;78.41;en>>
The application was declared admissible by the Chamber on the 26th of June 2012.

<<78.41;93.93;en>>
The Irish Human Rights Commission and the European Centre for Law and Justice were granted leave to submit written comments as third parties by virtue of Rule 44, paragraph 3 of the Rules of the Court.

<<93.93;106.33;en>>
On the 20th of September 2012, the Chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, none of the parties having objected to this relinquishment.

<<106.33;114.83;en>>
The government are represented by their agent, Mr. White, who is assisted by Mr. Mc Donagh

<<114.83;124.13;en>>
and Mr. Power, council, as well as by Ms. Farrell and Ms. McGarry, advisors.

<<124.13;131.71;en>>
The applicant is represented by Mr. Contillon and Ms. Scriven, both solicitors, as well

<<131.71;135.67;en>>
as by Mr. Holland and Mr. Keating, counsel.

<<135.67;140.15;en>>
The applicant is also present.

<<140.15;150.15;en>>
I welcome the applicant and the representatives of the parties in the name of the Court.

<<150.15;162.27;en>>
I would also like to welcome the visiting delegations of Georgian prosecutors and of representatives of Kosovo human rights institutions.

<<162.27;184.85;en>>
I would explain that in addition to interpretation in the two official languages of the Court, English and French, interpretation into Georgian as well as into Albanian and Serbian has been authorised for the benefit of these two visiting delegations.

<<184.85;198.51;en>>
That interpretation is not arranged by the Court and no transcription of the oral translation will be included in the official record of the proceedings.

<<198.51;210.71;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and the representative of the applicant, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<210.71;218.51;en>>
Mr. Holland for the applicant will speak first and Mr. Mc Donagh for the government then,

<<218.51;219.51;en>>
I call Mr. Holland.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<223.83;227.99;en>>
In January 1973, Louisa O'Keefe was an eight-year-old girl.

<<231.83;235.51;en>>
L.H. was headmaster of Dundarrow National School,

<<235.51;242.63;en>>
a pillar of the establishment in an Ireland in which national school teachers were held in the highest esteem.

<<242.63;254.51;en>>
He was invested by the state with a power that seems to an adult unremarkable, but is to a child awesome, omnipotent, and terrible.

<<254.51;267.47;en>>
It was a power that included that of corporal punishment, and Louisa O'Keefe was, as was said in Herzegovina and Austria, in a position of inferiority and powerlessness.

<<267.47;279.51;en>>
From January to September 1973, the headmaster repeatedly digitally molested and penetrated Louisa O'Keefe and her children.

<<279.51;286.47;en>>
She had to attend that school daily, never knowing when the call would come for a melodica class.

<<286.47;296.63;en>>
Constantly watching, fearing, hoping, worrying, in and out of melodica class, she endured months of inhumanity and degradation.

<<296.63;314.79;en>>
And ultimately, this case is about human rights in a pure enough form, a child's right to have the state protected with reasonable steps from sexual abuse by an adult placed by law in coercive power over that child.

<<314.79;319.87;en>>
As you'll find in the high court evidence of Louisa O'Keefe and Dr. Maree Doolery, there followed

<<319.87;338.31;en>>
for Louisa O'Keefe 20 years of not really understanding why it was she couldn't feel the way others felt, of marital problems, of sexual problems, until in the mid-1990s, the headmaster was tried and she began to understand.

<<338.31;344.61;en>>
She also learned then that she was not the only victim and far from the first.

<<344.61;349.23;en>>
The headmaster had been abusing since 1962.

<<349.23;356.03;en>>
He was charged with 386 offenses on 21 girls.

<<356.03;361.11;en>>
But these figures considerably understate the extent of his predation.

<<361.11;363.91;en>>
As Mr. Justice Gagin said in the Supreme Court,

<<363.91;370.11;en>>
an extraordinary feature of this case is that these were sample charges.

<<370.11;382.39;en>>
As was observed in the case of CAS and CS in Romania, in some cases, the bare facts speak for themselves of the absence of a system of protection.

<<382.39;406.35;en>>
No effective system of child protection could possibly allow a teacher to commit a decade of abuse of tens of victims on about 400 or more occasions in one school and then leave that school due to a complaint all without the Department of Education becoming aware of it until 20 years later.

<<406.35;417.51;en>>
Louisa O'Keefe found out in 1971 that a parent had explicitly complained to the school manager of abuse of another young girl.

<<417.51;423.91;en>>
Louisa O'Keefe could have been saved, but nothing was done.

<<423.91;431.47;en>>
The state seek to minimize this at paragraph 12 of their observations by saying that a concern was raised.

<<431.47;433.23;en>>
Be very clear.

<<433.23;438.87;en>>
Mrs. Hurley made a very clear and specific complaint in 1971.

<<438.87;446.65;en>>
Even in late 1973, when the headmaster was removed from the school, there was a chance for Louisa O'Keefe.

<<446.65;454.75;en>>
Had even the most basic investigation identified her as a victim, she would have been cared for and her future very different.

<<454.75;459.87;en>>
But again, in 1973, nothing was done.

<<459.87;475.87;en>>
Reading the state observations, it's necessary to remind yourself that the question for this court is not, was the headmaster guilty, nor was it that the bishop failed, nor was it that the parish priest or the manager or the curate failed, or even the parents.

<<475.87;480.19;en>>
The question now is, did the state fail?

<<480.19;490.15;en>>
In Zed and the United Kingdom, it's established that Louisa O'Keefe remains a victim as long as state liability remains undecided.

<<490.15;493.47;en>>
Carragher, cited by the state, is irrelevant.

<<493.47;500.17;en>>
Carragher was not a victim because she had settled the civil action which could have established state liability.

<<500.17;503.47;en>>
The same is true of Hay in the United Kingdom.

<<503.47;506.63;en>>
In fact, he even got an admission of police fault.

<<506.63;513.23;en>>
Doubtfire is similarly irrelevant because state wrongdoing had been acknowledged.

<<513.23;525.47;en>>
In Calvelli and Cicero in Italy, what was at issue was not remedy against the state, but the adequacy of compensation remedy against the offending doctor.

<<525.47;529.07;en>>
So none of the case laws cited by the state affects these issues.

<<529.07;540.71;en>>
Louisa O'Keefe has never settled with or received compensation from the state in any proceedings to establish state liability, and thus she remains a victim.

<<540.71;552.35;en>>
As to the award of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, that type of award was considered in Zed and the United Kingdom and August and the United Kingdom an almost identical compensation system.

<<552.35;564.55;en>>
And it was held that the scheme providing for ex gratia awards is separate from any notions of state liability and did not concern the applicant's convention rights.

<<564.55;576.47;en>>
Provision of an ex gratia award by the state is not part of a deterrent framework necessary to give practical protection of children against sex abuse.

<<576.47;586.91;en>>
August's case, of course, was inadmissible, but that was because he had not argued, as we do, that the state allowed the abuse to occur.

<<586.91;595.23;en>>
The premise of the CICT award is criminal act by the headmaster, not wrongdoing by the state.

<<595.23;602.75;en>>
The CICT is not a court, its members are not judges, and it does not address state liability.

<<602.75;620.51;en>>
Coming then to Article 35, Leysia and Latvia, Stork in Germany, and Salmoni in France all emphasize and emphasize in the court's word as to Article 35 that it must allow for context it must be interpreted flexibly and without excessive formalism.

<<620.51;624.91;en>>
It is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically.

<<624.91;635.35;en>>
It is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of the individual case and take a realistic view of the general legal and political context in which remedies operate.

<<635.35;641.15;en>>
And it does not require recourse to inadequate or ineffective remedy.

<<641.15;654.63;en>>
And in D and Ireland, all that was reduced to a single question, whether in all the circumstances the applicant had done everything that could reasonably be expected to exalt her remedies.

<<654.63;661.91;en>>
The state says that the complaint should have been filed in this case within six months of the non-suit of March 2004.

<<661.91;669.83;en>>
They therefore posit simultaneous and separate appeal to the Supreme Court and application to this court.

<<669.83;680.91;en>>
And that was a proposition rejected by this court, in effect, in Fernandez Molina against Spain, in which a very similar sequence of events occurred.

<<680.91;696.19;en>>
And the court held the time ran from the decision on appeal for the entire complaint as to require the applicants to apply on two different dates to the court would be to construe the time limit too formally.

<<696.19;708.45;en>>
The Article 35 must be applied so as to ensure the effective exercise of the right to individual application in keeping with the spirit and purpose of the convention.

<<708.45;726.87;en>>
Had we applied within six months of an on-suit, the state would stand here today and object at non-exhaustion of remedy, given the possibility which remained at that time that state liability would be decided in the Supreme Court, albeit on the basis of vicarious rather than direct liability.

<<726.87;733.61;en>>
As to the failure to appeal the non-suit on the state's direct negligence, true.

<<733.61;736.99;en>>
The action in the High Court failed for want of evidence.

<<736.99;745.47;en>>
But it is untrue to state that the applicant is now seeking to re-argue the case on the basis of evidence she could have put before the High Court.

<<745.47;756.71;en>>
As the state well knows, the flute of Judge Ryan's nine-year investigation into abuse was not published until after the Supreme Court hearing.

<<756.71;774.31;en>>
Also, we assert here that whereas at Irish law, the applicant bore the onus of proof of negligence before this court, the state, by reference to decisions of this court, should bear the onus of proof of an effective, protective, and preventative system.

<<774.31;777.51;en>>
So as to exhaustion, we have done what is reasonable.

<<777.51;781.27;en>>
Applying the non-suit, appealing the non-suit was pointless.

<<781.27;783.55;en>>
And the decision not to do so was reasonable.

<<783.55;792.03;en>>
First, because in the evidence, and even applying the decision of shoot and by lot to which the state refer, the appeal would have failed.

<<792.03;806.47;en>>
Indeed, in the Supreme Court, Judge Hardiman summarily rejected the direct negligence claim, saying the minister can hardly be responsible for a failure to cease the course of action of whose existence he was quite unaware.

<<806.47;814.37;en>>
Second, the view was legitimately taken that the Supreme Court would reject such an appeal as not raising an issue of law.

<<814.37;819.95;en>>
And of course, shoot and by lot was then 6 and 1 1 half years into the future.

<<819.95;828.43;en>>
And if, as the state says, it represents no more than longstanding law, it's a little odd that they cite no earlier authority.

<<828.43;840.51;en>>
In this regard, we rely on the court's view in the Reynolds case of the significance to that case of the UK Supreme Court decision in Rabone and Pennine Care.

<<840.51;865.71;en>>
As to suing the bishop, the state cite De La Hunty, the 2011, not 2001, there's an error in the chamber judgment, case of JGE and Portsmouth Diocese, Basley and Currie, Jacoby and Griffiths, and Doe and Bennett, none of which cases address the question of a bishop's liability for his predecessor's wrongs.

<<865.71;872.71;en>>
They do address the different question of his liability for his diocesan priests, but that's an entirely different question.

<<872.71;885.31;en>>
Some of these cases, interestingly, the Canadian ones, do reflect legislation in Canada making bishops and their diocese corporations sold, but there's no such legislation in Ireland.

<<885.31;891.07;en>>
True, Ireland says denial by patrons, bishops of liability, is not unusual.

<<891.07;894.19;en>>
But liability is denied for many reasons.

<<894.19;904.59;en>>
Bishops often, as Judge Gagan pointed out in the Supreme Court, for many reasons do not deny liability for their predecessors on the basis that they're not corporations sold.

<<904.59;911.59;en>>
But in this case, the Bishop of Cork did exactly that by his letter of December 1998.

<<911.59;918.27;en>>
And the law of Ireland was in his favor, and counsel advised Mrs. O'Keefe accordingly.

<<918.27;929.31;en>>
Rather than delay further on this point, I ask you to look to our submissions and paragraphs 1.46, 3.8, and 3.9 of the Murphy Report.

<<929.31;949.39;en>>
Turning to Article 3, yet again, and despite our rebuttal in the submission of November 2011, the state sets out to reject an argument we never made, a quote, philosophical argument that primary education must be entirely state run.

<<949.39;963.13;en>>
Now with the added barb that it represents a particular ideological outlook not necessarily shared universally by contracting states, we repeat nothing in our case supports that proposition.

<<963.13;976.01;en>>
This claim does not depend on any attack in principle on private or religious schooling, nor on the Irish system of school provision by private organizations such as the Catholic Church.

<<976.01;980.87;en>>
This case is not an ideological battleground.

<<980.87;989.39;en>>
As Costello-Roberts shows, in the last analysis, it doesn't matter if the school is private, public, or something in between.

<<989.39;996.39;en>>
As a matter of convention law, Ireland's subtle constitutional arrangements are in the end irrelevant.

<<996.39;1014.35;en>>
Whatever its educational structure, whatever its constitution provides, Ireland's obligations under the first protocol, Article 2, and under Article 3, a fundamental value, according to this court, those constitutional obligations remain.

<<1014.35;1021.67;en>>
Ireland seeks to distinguish van der Mizelle by saying that Ireland has not delegated any convention obligations.

<<1021.67;1035.67;en>>
Ireland confuses the dubious proposition of Irish constitutional law that it has not delegated educational duties it never possessed with the convention issue of delegation.

<<1035.67;1046.49;en>>
Because if Ireland has delegated no convention obligations as to education, then neither did the UK in Costello-Roberts.

<<1046.49;1050.35;en>>
Yet the court found just such a delegation.

<<1050.35;1063.99;en>>
In any event, the Irish constitutional proposition ignores its Article 42 duty to require that children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual, and social.

<<1063.99;1071.03;en>>
But then child abuse could better undermine the fulfillment of that duty.

<<1071.03;1077.11;en>>
Costello-Roberts, A in the United Kingdom, and E in the United Kingdom are clear.

<<1077.11;1089.55;en>>
Be it in a public or a private school, the state's convention obligations as to inhuman and degrading treatment and as to education remain the state's obligations.

<<1089.55;1097.55;en>>
The state incorrectly seeks to distinguish Costello-Roberts by saying we don't rely on Article 2 of Protocol 1.

<<1097.55;1099.07;en>>
We do.

<<1099.07;1107.91;en>>
It then characterizes Costello-Roberts as turning on a finding that school discipline is integral to education, whereas sexual abuse is its antithesis.

<<1107.91;1111.51;en>>
But that's not essential to our reliance on Costello-Roberts.

<<1111.51;1116.39;en>>
What's essential is that the obligations cannot be delegated.

<<1116.39;1121.81;en>>
And children in schools are vulnerable to those placed in authority over them.

<<1121.81;1131.39;en>>
What is relevant is the power relationship between a principal and a pupil and the general foreseeability of its abuse.

<<1131.39;1144.23;en>>
In the Jupila case, this court held that Articles 1 and 3 together require measures to ensure that individuals are not subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment by private individuals.

<<1144.23;1150.13;en>>
Children in particular are entitled to state protection from child abuse.

<<1150.13;1165.39;en>>
The duty of proactivity, of preventative action, is all the higher where children are put in the control of those who have permission to beat them and whose authority they personally cannot question.

<<1165.39;1172.79;en>>
In Stork, the court held that retrospective measures alone do not effectively protect vulnerable individuals.

<<1172.79;1175.55;en>>
Prevention is required.

<<1175.55;1187.35;en>>
And it applied the state's obligation to supervise private institutions in which there is a general risk of violation of fundamental convention rights.

<<1187.35;1192.27;en>>
The same is true as to hospitals in the Calvelli and Cicciolo case against Italy.

<<1192.27;1201.59;en>>
And if hospitals, then schools, because it's beyond argument that children in schools are vulnerable to sexual abuse.

<<1201.59;1209.91;en>>
Again, A in the United Kingdom, if the duty applies in the private home, A fortiori, it applies in schools.

<<1209.91;1217.67;en>>
Macbeth Caille of this court requires of states a framework of law to provide protection.

<<1217.67;1223.39;en>>
Where we ask is the Irish preventative framework of law.

<<1223.39;1229.75;en>>
The tragedy of this case is how little Louise O'Keefe needed of her state.

<<1229.75;1244.99;en>>
For all the reference to margins of appreciation, for all the fear by reference to the Keenan case of the imposition of impossible, unreasonable, or disproportionate burdens on the state, she needed very little of her state.

<<1244.99;1251.11;en>>
Ireland's premise is that if only they had known, they would have acted.

<<1251.11;1259.17;en>>
Had they been told in 1971 of the complaint, they would have stopped the abuse in time to save Louise O'Keefe.

<<1259.17;1264.11;en>>
Had they been told in 1973, they could have helped Louise O'Keefe.

<<1264.11;1281.71;en>>
If you accept that premise, all that Louise O'Keefe needed of her state was a simple instruction to school managers that where they learned of serious abuse of children, sexual or otherwise, they must report it to state authorities.

<<1281.71;1285.57;en>>
No expense, no burden, no cost.

<<1285.57;1298.07;en>>
Nothing but an instruction, which by the standard of causation set in E in the United Kingdom could have had a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm.

<<1298.07;1304.53;en>>
The failure to issue that simple instruction is sufficient to engage the responsibility of the state.

<<1304.53;1310.69;en>>
The starting point of the entire state argument is nobody told us about the abuse.

<<1310.69;1315.03;en>>
Had we but known, this is the two monkeys defense.

<<1315.03;1316.55;en>>
We saw no evil.

<<1316.55;1318.35;en>>
We heard no evil.

<<1318.35;1333.79;en>>
Unless the state satisfies you that it had in place an effective preventative system of law designed to bring the evil to its attention, we saw no evil, we heard no evil, is not a defense.

<<1333.79;1337.15;en>>
It is an admission of liability.

<<1337.15;1345.71;en>>
There is no evidence of any steps to see that sex abuse was brought to their attention once it was known to a manager.

<<1345.71;1353.43;en>>
Where do you find in the papers a single instruction to managers as to what to do if a complaint is made to you?

<<1353.43;1356.87;en>>
But in truth, state failure is more profound.

<<1356.87;1364.15;en>>
They say at paragraph 50, had they known of the abuse, LH would have lost his license to teach.

<<1364.15;1369.03;en>>
Chief Inspector McLennan said any other result was inconceivable.

<<1369.03;1375.31;en>>
No doubt a similarly complacent answer would have been given to Mr. Brander's victims

<<1375.31;1382.11;en>>
had they complained to this court before Ryan had exposed the Department of Education's true concerns.

<<1382.11;1391.59;en>>
As Ryan says, at no stage were the past, present, or potential future victims of Mr. Brander considered.

<<1391.59;1400.15;en>>
As Government Minister Martin said of the Brander scandal, there can be absolutely no excuse by reference to the standards of the time.

<<1400.15;1410.87;en>>
This is the Department of Education that now seeks to persuade this court of its compliance with convention duties as to child protection.

<<1410.87;1422.91;en>>
We say as to the immediate risk to individual criterion for preventative action that it applies only to operational obligations.

<<1422.91;1426.43;en>>
See Master Matteo and Italy and Opus and Turkey.

<<1426.43;1431.83;en>>
It does not apply to the mere issuing of regulations, instructions, and guidelines.

<<1431.83;1435.03;en>>
The problem in this case was not operational.

<<1435.03;1439.15;en>>
It was the absence of general preventative systems.

<<1439.15;1454.03;en>>
Second, and in principle, if the state must obviate a real and immediate risk, there is no reason why it should not also obviate a general or situational risk by reasonable general measures.

<<1454.03;1460.35;en>>
If needs be, we argue that the standard of immediate and real risk is unnecessarily rigid.

<<1460.35;1474.15;en>>
We invite the court to say simply that operational and regulatory obligations should be reasonable, not excessively burdensome, and proportional to the degree of known risk, whatever that degree may be.

<<1474.15;1487.63;en>>
That would allow for general, low burden measures, such as the issuing of regulations, instructions, and guidelines, to address locations of known but general risk to children in schools and similar institutions.

<<1487.63;1504.43;en>>
But however minimal the obligation on the state, could it ever be said that at any time, a duty to train and instruct managers in what to do in receipt of a complaint was a duty beyond the call of Article 3?

<<1504.43;1506.83;en>>
Would have cost nothing.

<<1506.83;1508.43;en>>
The hindsight argument is made.

<<1508.43;1512.55;en>>
We're told we apply modern standards to ancient times.

<<1512.55;1517.91;en>>
We say Article 3 always protected fundamental values.

<<1517.91;1525.83;en>>
Remember, the events underlying the X and Y against the Netherlands case took place only four years after Louisa O'Keefe was abused.

<<1525.83;1533.91;en>>
Ireland says there was simply no awareness of the risk of sexual abuse from a teacher in a situation such as this at that time.

<<1533.91;1540.07;en>>
We say that is untrue, and that Carrigan and Ryan clearly show it untrue.

<<1540.07;1547.35;en>>
As to the contemporary understanding of sex abuse, Ireland selectively quotes the Rollinson report which Ryan commissioned.

<<1547.35;1551.95;en>>
I urge you to read the entire paragraph, not least the following.

<<1551.95;1560.91;en>>
As early as 1952, the UK Home Office distributed a circular for all correspondents and heads of approved schools.

<<1560.91;1570.55;en>>
It drew their attention in precise detail to what should be done when indecent practices were committed on boys, either by other boys or by staff.

<<1570.55;1574.47;en>>
At times, it reads much like best advice today.

<<1574.47;1576.79;en>>
That's in 1952.

<<1576.79;1593.27;en>>
Ireland says, in effect, we knew enough to make sex abuse a crime, but we didn't know enough to take even basic measures to protect children from that crime, to prevent that crime or detect it.

<<1593.27;1604.39;en>>
This court inquired as to precise mechanisms, safeguards, and procedures to ensure complaints to managers were communicated to the state.

<<1604.39;1611.15;en>>
Ireland asserts that it's clear that Father O'Kelly did not convey the complaints to the department.

<<1611.15;1612.47;en>>
That's incorrect.

<<1612.47;1622.83;en>>
All that is clear is that he did not convey it to Inspector MacLennan and that the department can find no documentary record of any complaint.

<<1622.83;1636.75;en>>
If you look at Amnesty's publication in Paine's site, it records both the lack of Department of Education record-keeping as to complaints of sexual abuse and the absence of guidelines as to how to deal with it.

<<1636.75;1657.31;en>>
Professor Ferguson's report bears reading in full, but his observation is striking that there was almost complete absence of any protocols or procedures requiring the management of schools to respond to allegations or periodically check on a routine basis to ensure that there was no abuse.

<<1657.31;1663.55;en>>
And it rings even more true now that we've had the Ryan report and the Brander chapter.

<<1663.55;1674.03;en>>
The Irish Human Rights Commission record school management had no official guidance on how to deal with allegations or suspicions of child abuse.

<<1674.03;1681.31;en>>
Schools were under no duty to report such allegations to another authority, such as the Department of Education.

<<1681.31;1689.39;en>>
The state tells you in paragraph 69 the department issued specific guidance as to how to deal with complaints.

<<1689.39;1703.91;en>>
But all they produce is a grubby scrap of paper from 1970 telling departmental officials internally what to do if by some unhappiness chance they find themselves in receipt of a complaint.

<<1703.91;1710.03;en>>
There's no evidence that document was ever sent to anyone, much less a manager of schools.

<<1710.03;1711.23;en>>
The text is clear.

<<1711.23;1717.07;en>>
It relates only to what to do if the complaint actually reaches the department.

<<1717.07;1723.47;en>>
You may think in saying the words unhappy mischance, I'm being glib or unfair to the state.

<<1723.47;1733.67;en>>
If so, please read the Brander chapter of Ryan as to a national school teacher's 40-year career of sexual abuse.

<<1733.67;1739.07;en>>
A former pupil, now a teacher, told the department inspector about it.

<<1739.07;1740.43;en>>
He did nothing.

<<1740.43;1742.97;en>>
The former pupil wrote to the department.

<<1742.97;1744.63;en>>
It did nothing.

<<1744.63;1752.85;en>>
Ryan concludes, at no stage were the past, present, or potential future victims of Mr. Brander considered.

<<1752.85;1757.63;en>>
The debate was not in the department about how to investigate the complaint.

<<1757.63;1762.85;en>>
It was about what to do about a troublemaker who complained.

<<1762.85;1769.45;en>>
By choosing, Ryan says, to take the easy way out, the persons and bodies with knowledge of Mr. Brander's

<<1769.45;1773.87;en>>
activities must bear heavy responsibility for the damage he did to children.

<<1773.87;1778.59;en>>
But the state says, LH is not Brander.

<<1778.59;1790.47;en>>
Ryan considers that specifically, because in Brander he considers the conduct of the Department of Education and the contrast between theory and practice in the handling of complaints.

<<1790.47;1797.39;en>>
Ryan concludes, as to residential institutions, that the system failed the children.

<<1797.39;1801.49;en>>
It was not just a matter of occasional lapses.

<<1801.49;1810.77;en>>
The department gave the impression of investigation, but actually failed to do so and delayed the involvement of proper authorities.

<<1810.77;1818.23;en>>
The department did not apply the standards in the rules and their own guidelines when investigating complaints.

<<1818.23;1825.15;en>>
And the state says, you see, that these findings don't apply to national schools, that relates to residential schools.

<<1825.15;1833.35;en>>
They say that this very same Department of Education was, as to national schools, a stalwart defender of human rights.

<<1833.35;1838.19;en>>
That cannot be credited, nor did Ryan credit it.

<<1838.19;1854.57;en>>
He says he received a large number of complaints from national schools, and the Brander investigation, quote, illustrates the ease with which sexual predators could operate within the educational system without fear of disclosure or sanction.

<<1854.57;1858.59;en>>
For Ryan, Brander is not an isolated case.

<<1858.59;1867.87;en>>
He is an example of a general and abject state failure to protect children, even from known abusers.

<<1867.87;1871.87;en>>
Ryan's conclusions in the executive summary I invite you to look at.

<<1871.87;1876.53;en>>
But number 30 sums it up, as to the Department of Education.

<<1876.53;1878.45;en>>
A stunning conclusion.

<<1878.45;1885.83;en>>
Complaints about sexual abuse were generally dismissed or ignored.

<<1885.83;1901.19;en>>
Ryan at volume 3, 4, chapter 3, in a footnote, admittedly, at page 205, refers to the Carrigan report on sexual offenses, which actually ultimately led to the 1935 Criminal Law Act cited by the state.

<<1901.19;1907.83;en>>
Ryan, the footnote records, Carrigan did not discriminate between crimes within the family or at schools of whatever type.

<<1907.83;1909.71;en>>
And goes on to say the following.

<<1909.71;1922.19;en>>
The general lesson which this report and its non-publication, it was squashed, teaches is that there was a good deal of sexual crime against children in the early 1930s.

<<1922.19;1930.11;en>>
And there is no reason to suppose that this children's position changed at any rate for several decades.

<<1930.11;1942.53;en>>
And also, that the, again, this is stunning, the official approach was to sweep such matters under the carpet.

<<1942.53;1952.71;en>>
Ireland's defense is that Ireland had no role in ensuring that known sex abuse of children was reported to it.

<<1952.71;1959.75;en>>
The defense is see no evil, hear no evil, and this court should not countenance it.

<<1959.75;1959.79;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<1964.33;1966.97;en>>
Thank you Mr. Holland. I call Mr. Mc Donagh.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<1970.12;1972.2;en>>
May it please the Court.

<<1972.2;1980.72;en>>
At the time relevant, at all times relevant to this case in Ireland, the sexual abuse of children was a most serious criminal offense.

<<1980.72;1989.94;en>>
And the perpetrator who abused the applicant was prosecuted when the police were informed, an investigation took place, and he received a prison sentence.

<<1989.94;1994.64;en>>
The applicant thereafter commenced the domestic proceedings.

<<1994.64;1999.26;en>>
And in those proceedings, she made three claims.

<<1999.26;2007.04;en>>
The second claim was that the state was vicariously liable for the actions of the teacher, Leo Hickey.

<<2007.04;2012.12;en>>
The third claim suggested there was an Irish constitutional duty which had been breached.

<<2012.12;2018.0;en>>
The second and third parts of her claim don't concern this court in any significant way.

<<2018.0;2023.12;en>>
But the first part of her claim in the domestic proceedings certainly does.

<<2023.12;2030.04;en>>
This was the part of her claim where she alleged direct negligence against the Minister for Education.

<<2030.04;2071.12;en>>
At issue in the Irish proceedings, and at issue here in the applicant's case, is what the Irish state knew or ought to have known of the risk that a primary school child in a day school in 1972-73 in Ireland, the risk of that primary school child in a school established by a bishop, managed by a clergyman, the risk of that child being sexually abused by a teacher who was, to use my friend's phrase, a pillar of society, where the state had no knowledge of any such propensity on the part of that teacher.

<<2071.12;2080.56;en>>
In the course of the first question which was posed to the parties, references made to a number of cases, including the case of E versus the United Kingdom.

<<2080.56;2087.56;en>>
In that case, the authorities knew extensively of the propensity of the perpetrator.

<<2087.56;2097.52;en>>
But the Court's focus in that case was post-1977, where there was very considerable knowledge of the actions of E, of the perpetrator.

<<2097.52;2108.08;en>>
But even before 1977, in relation to a period where there's no finding of a breach of Article III, there was still some knowledge of the propensity of the perpetrator.

<<2108.08;2112.44;en>>
But there's no finding of this Court against the terms of a breach.

<<2112.44;2118.2;en>>
But in fact, in this case, there was no knowledge of any propensity on the part of the perpetrator.

<<2118.2;2131.12;en>>
In the case of A versus the United Kingdom, it's clear that the United Kingdom permitted reasonable chastisement as a defense in the context of what might seem a very brutal assault of a child.

<<2131.12;2136.32;en>>
And accordingly, that reasonable chastisement defense had led to the acquittal of the perpetrator.

<<2136.32;2140.12;en>>
And clearly, that is a totally different situation to here.

<<2140.12;2146.8;en>>
As regards the case of Costolo Roberts, we say the applicant misunderstands the judgment in that case.

<<2146.8;2161.88;en>>
Although the case was certainly about punishment being inflicted in a private school, the Court makes clear in that case that it was the school's disciplinary system that fell within the ambit of the provision of education.

<<2161.88;2171.16;en>>
Although the corporal punishment in that case was the act of the headmaster, the administration of corporal punishment engaged the responsibility of the United Kingdom.

<<2171.16;2182.34;en>>
In other words, the United Kingdom tolerated, permitted, quite expressly so, the administration of corporal punishment in a school such as that attended by Mr. Costolo Roberts.

<<2182.34;2197.44;en>>
In contrast, the sexual abuse of children is the very antithesis of what a teacher is employed to do in a school and cannot be equated in any sense to a school's disciplinary system.

<<2197.44;2223.64;en>>
In terms of the existence in Ireland of control mechanisms to have prevented untoward occurrences in the nature of sexual abuse, the question of control mechanisms for the protection of children cannot, in logic, be treated as an issue divorced from what needs to be controlled and why it needs to be controlled.

<<2223.64;2235.9;en>>
In other words, the extent to which a control mechanism is appropriate is directly related to the extent of the risk that requires to be controlled.

<<2235.9;2252.4;en>>
The applicant in today's case claimed in the domestic court that the state was liable to compensate her as the state had been negligent and in breach of duty in its failure to put in place control mechanisms.

<<2252.4;2268.0;en>>
In other words, sufficient protocols, instructions, training, safeguards, and procedures prior to the abuse in 1973 so as to have prevented her from being abused or to have lessened the prospect of her being abused.

<<2268.0;2278.42;en>>
These allegations of a failure to protect the applicant are detailed in 22 subparagraphs in the statement of her claim, which issued at the end of 1999.

<<2278.42;2281.78;en>>
It was March of 1999, in fact, the 3rd of March.

<<2281.78;2295.44;en>>
By way of example, I want to quote and cite to the court two of those 22, please, to corroborate my suggestion that the same claim was initially advanced in the domestic court as is advanced here.

<<2295.44;2315.66;en>>
Subparagraph L of her particulars of claim suggests that the minister had failed to ensure that any complaints made against a teacher in the said school, including the principal teacher, was brought to the attention of the minister, either promptly or at all.

<<2315.66;2333.3;en>>
Secondly, subparagraph F, the minister failed to provide any or any adequate and proper training or supervision for the manager of the said premises or to ensure that such training and supervision was provided by the patron to the manager.

<<2333.3;2346.8;en>>
Both of these are merely examples of the detailed series of allegations in the statement of claim that the minister should have ensured prior to 1973 there was in place significant control mechanisms and procedures.

<<2346.8;2350.8;en>>
These claims mirror the claims the applicant makes in these proceedings.

<<2350.8;2355.14;en>>
And I'd cite, for example, paragraph 73 of her observations.

<<2355.14;2363.5;en>>
In truth, the applicant makes the same claims as were pleaded before the Irish High Court, but has simply adapted them to suit a convention context.

<<2363.5;2373.34;en>>
No real attempt was made by the applicant, notwithstanding this formed an important part of her case, to pursue this case at the High Court in Ireland.

<<2373.34;2379.66;en>>
She did not abandon that part of her case, so she pursued it right up to the point where the High Court judge dismissed it.

<<2379.66;2383.66;en>>
But she didn't call evidence to support it.

<<2383.66;2389.34;en>>
And that is a major issue, we say, in whether the applicant failed to exhaust her domestic remedies.

<<2389.34;2394.34;en>>
Having pleaded her case, she didn't call the evidence to support it.

<<2394.34;2409.62;en>>
So when the High Court judge held that there was no prima facie case made out by the applicant, he had no real choice in the matter, because the applicant hadn't put the witnesses in the witness box to corroborate, give evidence that her pleas were substantiated.

<<2409.62;2422.02;en>>
And although the minister was in a position to call evidence in response, there was no need to, because there was simply no substantive evidence called to support this first and fundamental part of her case.

<<2422.02;2429.98;en>>
We say, the government says, that the applicant's failure to pursue this issue before the domestic courts is relevant to the question of admissibility.

<<2429.98;2433.7;en>>
That is our primary argument in respect of admissibility on this count.

<<2433.7;2440.7;en>>
It's not so much failing to make a complaint to this court within six months of the granting of a direction there's no case to answer.

<<2440.7;2458.9;en>>
It's rather the fact that the applicant brought her case, that the applicant knew or ought to have known of the risks associated with the applicant attending this school and yet failed to call evidence which could have been tested in the domestic context by cross-examination and then by the calling of further evidence.

<<2458.9;2472.5;en>>
In addition to the relevance of this argument to admissibility, this argument is also relevant and is a fundamental relevance to the substance of the substantive claim that the applicant makes in this regard.

<<2472.5;2483.06;en>>
There's a particular aspect of the evidence which we say on this issue which is of very great significance, and that relates to the report of Professor Ferguson, and I'll come back to that.

<<2483.06;2499.46;en>>
It's clearly impossible to address the adequacy of the reaction of the state to the risk of abuse at some point in the past, 30 or 40 years ago, without first establishing what the risks were and what the state knew or ought to have known.

<<2499.46;2509.54;en>>
But the applicant now finds herself in this court in the position of not being able to advance her claim without in some way relying on evidence in this regard.

<<2509.54;2522.3;en>>
Her dilemma is that not having called evidence on this point in the Irish courts, she can't point to a transcript, she can't point to evidence before the Irish courts which would help her with her claim.

<<2522.3;2529.7;en>>
Despite the fact she didn't call this evidence, despite the fact she abandoned this part of her claim, she still now tries to make it.

<<2529.7;2548.1;en>>
By way of example, at paragraph 40 of her written observations, she says, she refers to what she says is the woeful inadequacy of, absence of, such instructions, advice, and or training, and goes on to make these assertions in respect to the whole of Ireland.

<<2548.1;2553.42;en>>
It mirrors almost exactly the wording in her Irish statement of claim.

<<2553.42;2564.24;en>>
The applicant correctly points out that the current child protection framework in Ireland is reflected in the 2011 version of Children First.

<<2564.24;2573.7;en>>
The applicant states in her written observations that there was no such framework in place in 1970 or 1971.

<<2573.7;2577.3;en>>
And then she goes on to make the following assertion.

<<2577.3;2586.06;en>>
There is no reason why such a document did not exist in 1970 or 1971.

<<2586.06;2592.76;en>>
In fact, there is a reason why such a document did not exist in 1970 or 1971.

<<2592.76;2597.14;en>>
And that reason is at the core of an issue for the court today.

<<2597.14;2599.7;en>>
The applicant knows that reason.

<<2599.7;2619.18;en>>
And she knows that reason because four years after she pleaded her case, her legal advisors obtained an expert report from a highly qualified expert on the history of child protection in Ireland and Britain, and indeed, perhaps further afield, Professor Harry Ferguson.

<<2619.18;2629.68;en>>
And his report is appended at appendix 13 to our written observations, not to the applicant's written observations on the substantive issues.

<<2629.68;2632.78;en>>
It features in the just satisfaction written observations.

<<2632.78;2638.02;en>>
But we have appended it at appendix 13 in our replying written observations.

<<2638.02;2644.18;en>>
Professor Ferguson is not a lawyer, but a well-known academic who has specialized in the history of child protection.

<<2644.18;2652.14;en>>
So four years after the statement of claim, in April 2003, his expert opinion is sought.

<<2652.14;2663.54;en>>
And it appears to us, a fair observation, that it's the content of that opinion that led to the applicant not pursuing her case in direct negligence against the state.

<<2663.54;2671.78;en>>
And the reason she didn't do it is because Professor Ferguson says in terms, there's no evidence to support that part of your case.

<<2671.78;2680.3;en>>
He was specifically asked to address the question of the adequacy of child protection control mechanisms in the Ireland of 30 years earlier.

<<2680.3;2695.62;en>>
And in that report, and I would commend the report to the court, because in many ways it is very relevant, certainly in respect of this aspect of matters, he informed the applicant she would find it very difficult to establish what he'd been asked to advise on.

<<2695.62;2714.48;en>>
And I'm quoting here, very difficult to establish that if the state had gone to any responsible educational psychologist in 1973, they would have been told that the protocols which are now in place in 2003, now in place, needed to be in place then.

<<2714.48;2720.34;en>>
He then places what occurred in the historical and sociological context.

<<2720.34;2722.18;en>>
He cites statistics.

<<2722.18;2728.66;en>>
He cites reports of the Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Children in Britain and Ireland.

<<2728.66;2734.82;en>>
He cites the understanding of child sexual abuse as it was in the 1950s and 60s and earlier.

<<2734.82;2741.4;en>>
He felt there was a minimal awareness of the risks of abuse of the type that occurred here.

<<2741.4;2751.34;en>>
At day school, a teacher, no known propensity, he felt there was minimal knowledge of the risks of a person in authority abusing a child.

<<2751.34;2766.62;en>>
He also states in a further portion of his report that the very basis upon which the applicant now seeks in this court to argue that the state ought to have known of the abuse.

<<2766.62;2787.5;en>>
He states that this basis, and I'm quoting here, will be torn apart on the basis that however much we would like it to be otherwise, it is not possible or just to project back onto the past knowledge and systems of accountability that we have today.

<<2787.5;2800.3;en>>
Their side, that's the government, their side can argue that people and even the best of professionals, responsible educational psychologists included, cannot be expected to know what they cannot know.

<<2800.3;2804.9;en>>
And the tragedy is that children like Louise were not protected as a consequence.

<<2804.9;2814.14;en>>
That was his view in April 2003 of the basis upon which the applicant then plaintiff was going to try and allege negligence against the state.

<<2814.14;2817.34;en>>
That view appears to have influenced the applicant.

<<2817.34;2821.86;en>>
Be that as it may, no evidence was called on this issue in the Irish High Court.

<<2821.86;2828.62;en>>
Professor Ferguson also addresses in the course of that report the belief that the school management was responsible.

<<2828.62;2831.22;en>>
He's very strongly of that view.

<<2831.22;2837.08;en>>
But at that stage, of course, four years down the line, school management wasn't joined in the proceedings.

<<2837.08;2838.96;en>>
The bishop wasn't joined.

<<2838.96;2843.58;en>>
There was no attempt to sue the manager of the school or the estate of the predecessor.

<<2843.58;2845.74;en>>
They simply didn't feature in the case.

<<2845.74;2851.06;en>>
So his very strong view in that report that the school was responsible was really irrelevant.

<<2851.06;2856.18;en>>
He also, as a non-lawyer, offers views on the responsibility of the minister, the carious responsibility.

<<2856.18;2864.22;en>>
That was the argument which failed in the Irish courts on legal principles, which the Supreme Court sets out in some detail.

<<2864.22;2877.1;en>>
But the essential relevance of his report is that as an expert, and his expertise is detailed at the top of his report, his extensive experience in the area was that the arguments the applicant wants to make today, is making today, would be torn apart.

<<2877.1;2881.34;en>>
And that's, we suspect, very much why that argument wasn't pursued.

<<2881.34;2886.08;en>>
The applicant, of course, doesn't rely on the report of Professor Ferguson before this court.

<<2886.08;2889.62;en>>
But it certainly appears to have contributed to her decision.

<<2889.62;2911.22;en>>
With great respect to the decision of the Fifth Section, which felt that the applicant's claim was admissible, and she should not have been expected to pursue that part of her case before the Irish courts, having lost on vicarious liability, we would respectfully suggest, as we do in our written observations, that in fact, the issue of admissibility remains very much a live issue.

<<2911.22;2918.3;en>>
It's not that we were of the view that having failed before the Irish courts on vicarious liability, the applicant should then have pursued another remedy.

<<2918.3;2919.58;en>>
That's not our argument.

<<2919.58;2933.86;en>>
Our argument is that having pursued the remedy up to the point of calling evidence, she effectively abandoned it, thereby depriving the Irish State of the opportunity of testing and contesting any evidence on this issue, which it would have done had the matter been pursued.

<<2933.86;2941.66;en>>
And I think the report of Professor Ferguson is of very great interest in that regard as well.

<<2941.66;2950.12;en>>
What the applicant does do before this court is seek to rely on a number of other matters to suggest the Irish State knew or ought to have known of the risks.

<<2950.12;2962.34;en>>
Having ignored her own expert, she refers to, in her written observations, to the Irish Human Rights Commission, citing State suppression of the 1931 Carrigan Report.

<<2962.34;2966.06;en>>
This is, if I may say so, I respectfully suggest a misnomer.

<<2966.06;2970.58;en>>
The report was not published or circulated, but the report was implemented.

<<2970.58;2976.72;en>>
The report led to the amendments brought about by the Criminal Law Amendment back 1935, which created some offenses.

<<2976.72;2978.46;en>>
It made other offenses more severe.

<<2978.46;2982.78;en>>
It removed a defense of reasonable mistake as to age in respect of another offense.

<<2982.78;2990.38;en>>
It certainly made the statutory regime more strict in respect of offenses against young people.

<<2990.38;2992.02;en>>
The report wasn't circulated.

<<2992.02;2994.42;en>>
If one person says that's suppression, so be it.

<<2994.42;2999.22;en>>
But in the Europe of 1931, one suspects that it couldn't amount to suppression.

<<2999.22;3001.62;en>>
It simply wasn't put fit to circulate it.

<<3001.62;3004.96;en>>
But the results of the report were implemented.

<<3004.96;3022.94;en>>
But the more important fallacy, if I may say so, underlying the attempt to rely on this report, is the fact that at paragraph 84 of her observations, the applicant clearly states that the Carrigan report documented extensive state knowledge of very many cases of sexual abuse of primary school children.

<<3022.94;3024.34;en>>
It did not.

<<3024.34;3026.06;en>>
It simply did not.

<<3026.06;3032.54;en>>
It is appended at appendix 14 to the state's observations and merits being read in full.

<<3032.54;3034.9;en>>
It is a report of its time.

<<3034.9;3037.28;en>>
It highlights a number of issues.

<<3037.28;3045.06;en>>
Juvenile prostitution, incest in tenements where families are living in close proximity.

<<3045.06;3048.58;en>>
It certainly refers to child prostitution.

<<3048.58;3052.94;en>>
It refers to the introduction of dance halls in rural areas.

<<3052.94;3059.94;en>>
It refers to motor cars and the difficulties associated with the free availability of motor cars.

<<3059.94;3070.18;en>>
So it certainly deals with the sexual mores of young people and the risks, the attendant risks, from exploitation by family members.

<<3070.18;3071.86;en>>
But it does not document.

<<3071.86;3080.3;en>>
It simply does not document any risks that were felt to arise in respect of primary school children or any children in school from teachers.

<<3080.3;3084.44;en>>
Absolutely no mention in the report whatsoever.

<<3084.44;3096.22;en>>
And we would respectfully suggest that a person who had read the Carrigan report could not make the assertion that it documents many cases of sexual abuse of primary school children.

<<3096.22;3103.06;en>>
The Carrigan report, therefore, was not the smoking gun that may have been suggested.

<<3103.06;3116.6;en>>
In addition to an inappropriate reliance on the Carrigan report, there is a reference, a correct reference, to the fact that in the course of the Supreme Court judgment in the applicant's own case, Mr. Justice Gagin and Mr. Justice Fennelly

<<3116.6;3131.72;en>>
both refer to the fact that in recent years, the Supreme Court and the High Court in Ireland have had to deal with a, they've become familiar with, allegations of sexual assaults, including sexual assaults by teachers.

<<3131.72;3147.88;en>>
But the applicant does not explain the readily available fact that the period which the judges are referring is the period from the mid-1990s, some 25 years, 23, 24 years after the applicant was abused.

<<3147.88;3151.04;en>>
The applicant also refers to the Ryan report.

<<3151.04;3167.92;en>>
And we say inappropriately, the Ryan report was into residential institutions, where by and large, religious orders are placed in loco parentis of children, most often by the state, often on foot of court orders.

<<3167.92;3181.76;en>>
And unfortunately, in a very distressing aspect of Irish history, on many occasions, those orders and people involved in those orders did not behave appropriately towards those children, and indeed, most inappropriately towards those children.

<<3181.76;3192.8;en>>
And there are many findings in the Ryan report that those responsible for the residential institutions did not in any sense vindicate the rights, indeed, the childhood of those children.

<<3192.8;3196.08;en>>
But in that context, there was the case of Mr. Brander.

<<3196.08;3201.92;en>>
Mr. Brander is somebody who, due to the negligence and failures

<<3201.92;3216.08;en>>
on the part of those who had originally had him inducted him into a religious order, and thereafter had employed him in various schools, he was allowed to continue with the depredations which are recounted.

<<3216.08;3221.92;en>>
But the involvement of the Department of Education occurred in the early 1980s.

<<3221.92;3227.04;en>>
And the minister in Ireland has long time since apologized for the failure in the case of Mr. Brander,

<<3227.04;3231.4;en>>
when in the early 1980s, a complaint made about him was not dealt with appropriately.

<<3231.4;3243.8;en>>
But one cannot extrapolate from that, and from comments about children who are in residential institutions, one can't extrapolate from that and cover the 3,500 Irish schools, primary schools.

<<3243.8;3247.32;en>>
It simply isn't appropriate and is impermissible.

<<3247.32;3261.96;en>>
And it certainly can't be said that the department habitually ignored anything in respect of the type of school that the applicant was in, where she was, as I say, being taught by the abuser.

<<3261.96;3275.2;en>>
It's also important to recall, given the reliance the applicant tries to place on the Ryan report, that the applicant's difficulty in the Irish High Court wasn't the failure to call evidence in respect of a lot of other children who'd been abused.

<<3275.2;3281.4;en>>
It was a failure to address international standards or national standards as to what should have been in place.

<<3281.4;3284.2;en>>
And although Mr. Justice Ryan took a long time

<<3284.2;3297.08;en>>
to address all the details of the abuse that had occurred in those residential institutions, it's not necessarily the case that that length of time was spent addressing what should have been in place at the time in Irish primary schools.

<<3297.08;3306.24;en>>
And in that regard, there is a report, which again we append, which is that of Richard Rollinson, who is a United Kingdom academic.

<<3306.24;3326.36;en>>
And he, in the course of his report, admittedly dealing with residential schools, but he has a general comment about the state of knowledge in the 1960s and 1970s, about the knowledge of the risk of abuse by a person in a position of trust, and what he says there is quite consistent with what Professor Ferguson had said and with what the government is saying here.

<<3326.36;3331.96;en>>
That is, there was no real significant knowledge of the risks.

<<3331.96;3339.08;en>>
And so we say that when one applies the established case law of this Court, one must look to see what the State knew or ought to have known.

<<3339.08;3343.48;en>>
The State did not know here of the propensities of Mr. Hickey.

<<3343.48;3355.44;en>>
And when the question comes as to what it ought to have known, the applicant hasn't really put before this Court any evidence as to what should have been in place in terms of additional safeguards.

<<3355.44;3358.04;en>>
Clearly, she believes there should be additional safeguards.

<<3358.04;3368.84;en>>
There were safeguards in place at the time appropriate to what was understood at the time to be the reality of what risks might arise in the context of the school in which the applicant was.

<<3368.84;3373.38;en>>
This brings me to another important point, which I hopefully can deal with fairly briefly.

<<3373.38;3384.56;en>>
Because in the course of the written observations, indeed, the session before the Court is the third set of written observations, which the applicant and, indeed, the respondent has put in for various procedural reasons.

<<3384.56;3400.84;en>>
The applicant has persisted in seeking to recharacterize the Irish school system in a way inconsistent with what the Irish Supreme Court has said is, in fact, the way it is organized and why it is organized like that.

<<3400.84;3427.06;en>>
The Court will recall that in portions of the Irish Supreme Court judgment, which have been cited in the written observations, the Irish Supreme Court has said quite clearly that the State, for historical reasons and for reasons that have seemed good to the Irish people through successive parliaments, has been deprived of the control of education, the control of teachers that might otherwise be the case in a state-run system.

<<3427.06;3435.04;en>>
The applicant in the written observations up until this point has described that as a technical bureaucratic distinction.

<<3435.04;3440.8;en>>
We say it's a fundamental misunderstanding and misrepresentation of, in fact, the Irish school system.

<<3440.8;3443.2;en>>
But in light of what Mr. Holland says today,

<<3443.2;3450.88;en>>
he makes now apparently no argument that the way the Irish school system operates forms part of his case.

<<3450.88;3454.16;en>>
It did seem to form a significant part of his case until now.

<<3454.16;3455.24;en>>
Now it appears it doesn't.

<<3455.24;3457.0;en>>
With respect, we would agree with him.

<<3457.0;3458.56;en>>
We would agree with him.

<<3458.56;3466.6;en>>
And in fact, whether Ireland has a state system, a partial state system, a private system, that doesn't affect obligations in terms of Article 3.

<<3466.6;3480.24;en>>
The reality is, if the state knew or ought to have known of the risks in a school, in a sports club, in a social care setting, the principle is that appropriate action must be taken.

<<3480.24;3484.76;en>>
But the reality is that all depends on what knew or ought to have known.

<<3484.76;3500.76;en>>
And therefore, I think the court can ignore, in large measure, much of the criticism, the heartfelt criticism, from, we suggested, perhaps a philosophical basis at the way that the Irish people have adapted the educational system to suit their own particular purposes.

<<3500.76;3504.12;en>>
That no longer forms part, it seems to us, of the applicant's case.

<<3507.16;3510.52;en>>
We also say that the applicant has failed.

<<3510.52;3513.24;en>>
We say this quite frequently in written observations.

<<3513.24;3515.84;en>>
She has failed to sue the most obvious defendant.

<<3515.84;3520.2;en>>
And the most obvious defendant here was the school management authority, the bishop.

<<3520.2;3524.96;en>>
There is a letter exhibited at appendix 19 in my friend's written observations.

<<3524.96;3528.1;en>>
And it's the letter they received back from the solicitor for the bishop.

<<3528.1;3530.76;en>>
It makes three points, three observations.

<<3530.76;3537.8;en>>
There is a blanket denial from the bishop that he could be responsible for the actions of his predecessor in office.

<<3537.8;3557.0;en>>
This government points out that that particular argument doesn't appear to be a particularly attractive one to the bishops in the fact that the statistics we've put into our written observations discloses that many millions of euro have been paid out by dioceses in Ireland, particularly the Archdiocese of Dublin, in respect of past incidents of abuse.

<<3557.0;3558.8;en>>
So that point is made in the letter.

<<3558.8;3560.76;en>>
We do, but certainly is not tested.

<<3560.76;3563.24;en>>
And certainly, the applicant didn't choose to test it.

<<3563.24;3569.32;en>>
But the relevance of that, we believe, also has to be seen in light of the fact that there are two other points made in that letter.

<<3569.32;3584.28;en>>
The second point made in that letter is that the bishop says that you could not be vicariously liable for acts of sexual abuse since those acts fall so far outside the terms of employment.

<<3584.28;3593.28;en>>
That issue was, of course, contested vigorously by the applicant against the minister in the Irish domestic proceedings.

<<3593.28;3596.12;en>>
So she didn't accept that at face value.

<<3596.12;3599.92;en>>
That formed a major part of her case against the minister.

<<3599.92;3617.12;en>>
And finally, the third point the bishop makes, and this is a matter I can't take any further than this, but I note that in response, the bishop says to the solicitor for the applicant that this has been extremely difficult for our client in view of the deaths of all these people.

<<3617.12;3625.0;en>>
That's the bishop believes that it is not true to state that this allegation was known to Bishop Lucy, as is claimed in your letter.

<<3625.0;3640.54;en>>
So all we know is, all we, the government, know is that at a certain point in 1999, there was a case being made on behalf of the applicant that Bishop Lucy, the patron of the school, knew of the complaint made earlier.

<<3640.54;3641.58;en>>
I don't know if he knew.

<<3641.58;3643.24;en>>
The government doesn't know if he knew.

<<3643.24;3645.4;en>>
But we know the applicant believed he knew.

<<3645.4;3650.48;en>>
And yet that point was never proceeded with and was never pursued.

<<3650.48;3661.4;en>>
We believe the applicant is being somewhat selective in suggesting that she couldn't have sued the bishop, since she clearly pursued the other issue which had been denied in the letter, issue of vicarious liability.

<<3661.4;3676.64;en>>
And of course, it's also the case that the state itself sent the minister in the Irish proceedings also sent a letter denying liability in somewhat similar, not identical terms, obviously, but denying the minister's liability and why the minister was not liable.

<<3676.64;3679.6;en>>
And that letter was not accepted at face value.

<<3679.6;3682.2;en>>
And the matter was pursued right up to the Supreme Court.

<<3682.2;3685.32;en>>
So we do believe that there was a case to be made there.

<<3685.32;3688.36;en>>
And it's a case that was never made and was never tested.

<<3688.36;3695.48;en>>
There is no vacuum and was no vacuum at the heart of the Irish school system at the time, or indeed now.

<<3695.48;3704.48;en>>
It's the balance that has been struck in Ireland is that the state did not have the type of control that might have existed in other countries for good reason.

<<3704.48;3710.04;en>>
That does not, of course, mean there's no responsibility in terms of ensuring protection of children.

<<3710.04;3711.28;en>>
Of course not.

<<3711.28;3718.42;en>>
But the nature of the educational structures is not something we believe which the applicant now seeks to rely on.

<<3718.42;3723.2;en>>
The applicant makes a number of other allegations which we feel we should briefly respond to.

<<3723.2;3725.36;en>>
The rules for national schools were there.

<<3725.36;3726.56;en>>
They were being implemented.

<<3726.56;3732.16;en>>
There is no suggestion that the fact they didn't feature in any act of parliament had any effect on matters.

<<3732.16;3735.12;en>>
The evidence of Mr. O'Dlanon, the school's inspector,

<<3735.12;3743.24;en>>
was very clear, which was that if any complaint was made to him, it would have been dealt with, and the teacher would probably have lost his license.

<<3743.24;3747.84;en>>
That was the evidence which is there and is pointed to.

<<3747.84;3755.28;en>>
There's also a suggestion that the attitude of the state respondent, the government, is in some way changing here about the rules for national schools.

<<3755.28;3756.92;en>>
That is absolutely untrue.

<<3756.92;3768.96;en>>
The reality is that in the framework that was in place at the time, which was a framework which was appropriate, it was a school run and managed by the patron and by the manager.

<<3768.96;3771.6;en>>
The minister had a more limited role.

<<3771.6;3774.44;en>>
And if a matter was brought to his attention, it was dealt with.

<<3774.44;3780.48;en>>
It was the academic standards in the school that were appropriate, because that was perceived at the time to be appropriate.

<<3780.48;3789.0;en>>
One cannot cast back 40 years and try and impose, we say, on Ireland or any other contracting state, standards of today.

<<3789.0;3801.36;en>>
And if one looks at Ireland of 40 years ago, we would respectfully suggest there is absolutely no evidence that the standards of protection for children in Ireland at the time were any less than in other contracting states.

<<3801.36;3813.62;en>>
And indeed, if that was the case or a case was to be made in that regard, now, 14 years after the case commenced, one can be, I think, morally certain the applicant would have identified those standards and put them before the court.

<<3813.62;3820.32;en>>
The only document which the applicant adds into the pot today is a Home Office Memorandum from 1952.

<<3820.32;3829.24;en>>
Notwithstanding the historically close relations Ireland has had with the United Kingdom, by 1952, Home Office Memoranda did not percolate through to the Irish school system.

<<3829.24;3835.68;en>>
And therefore, I don't think merely citing that can advance the applicant's case in any way.

<<3835.68;3835.68;en>>
May I please take questions?

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<3841.28;3842.76;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Mc Donagh.

<<3842.76;3850.52;en>>
I turn now to the judges if there are questions.

<<3850.52;3853.48;en>>
This does not seem to be the case.

<<3853.48;3857.76;en>>
The court is, Judge Charleton.

[[Judge;Peter Charleton]]

<<3859.05;3864.05;en>>
If I may, Monsieur le President, I have some questions.

<<3864.05;3883.91;en>>
Firstly, for the state, that's to say the government of Ireland, can you give me another instance where the state pays the salary of anyone, leave out the word teacher for the moment, but is not liable for his or her misconduct vicariously?

<<3883.91;3884.85;en>>
That's the first question.

<<3884.85;3884.85;en>>
I have some others.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<3886.42;3888.46;en>>
Yes, please.

<<3889.46;3890.58;en>>
Will I put all of them together?

<<3890.58;3891.58;en>>
Then we will rise and we will come back later.

<<3891.58;3891.58;en>>
Yes, okay.

[[Judge;Peter Charleton]]

<<3895.52;3911.26;en>>
Secondly for the state, could a teacher by sexual abuse ever, absent negligence, make his employer vicariously liable?

<<3911.26;3936.86;en>>
And then thirdly again for the state, just by way of clarification, I take it that the reference to the Carrigan Report and the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 is to the provision which makes any sexual action with a girl of 14 years or under unlawful and something to which she cannot consent.

<<3936.86;3936.86;en>>
Those are my questions for the state, Mr. President.

<<3941.0;3942.8;en>>
I have some also for the applicant.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<3943.53;3945.53;en>>
Put them immediately to the audience, please.

[[Judge;Peter Charleton]]

<<3946.01;3959.19;en>>
Breyer. Okay. It is said that the master was immune and that the State wanted

<<3959.19;3966.65;en>>
to sweep any allegation in relation to sexual abuse of a child under the carpet.

<<3966.65;3994.97;en>>
If that is so, why is it on the transcript that, again, not using names, the master had a special arrangement by way of secretly looking into the other classroom to observe the other teacher with a piece of paper that he could uncover to see what was happening and also ceased any time there was a noise of a car in his abuse? In other words, how

<<3994.97;4002.25;en>>
is your submission consistent with the fact that he feared being found out?

<<4002.25;4014.17;en>>
I have another question also for the applicant. It's in relation to the bishop. In Ireland,

<<4014.17;4023.17;en>>
we have a procedure called the O'Byrne letter. If you have potentially four defendants, for

<<4023.17;4051.41;en>>
instance, someone trips on the road and you don't know whether the hole in the road was caused by the gas company, the electricity company, the municipal authority, you write an O'Byrne letter to all of them, and once you have written that letter calling on them to sort out liability amongst themselves, it is the losing defendant against whom the order for costs is made. That being so, what possible reason do you have for not suing

<<4051.41;4061.53;en>>
the bishop? And then the last question to the applicant's

<<4061.53;4074.57;en>>
representatives, and by the way, this is not addressed to the applicant who is the victim in this case. It is addressed to the council. What suggestion was actually made at trial

<<4074.57;4082.17;en>>
through evidence as to the protection of children that could prevent abuse? And are you making

<<4082.17;4109.13;en>>
the allegation that the Stay Safe program, which was implemented in 1999, and which all of us who have children who are under 14 or 15 are familiar with, may succeed in stopping this kind of abuse? Are you making the suggestion that it should have been a Stay Safe program,

<<4109.13;4115.21;en>>
whereby there is reference taught to children about private areas, private actions, something which did not happen up to that time? So those are my questions, Mr. Lepresto.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4119.97;4122.83;en>>
Thank you, Judge Charleton, Judge De Gaetano, please.

[[Judge;Vincent A. De Gaetano]]

<<4125.1;4126.1;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4126.1;4136.26;en>>
I have two questions, one addressed to the, to counsel for the respondent government, and the other to both.

<<4136.26;4144.32;en>>
The first question is, I would like to have some further reaction from the respondent government.

<<4144.32;4156.34;en>>
What the government has to say in reply to the applicant's reference to the guidance note of the 6th of May, 1970.

<<4156.34;4164.02;en>>
The applicant says it was totally ineffectual, in effect, no real guidance whatsoever.

<<4164.02;4168.9;en>>
I would like to have the respondent government's reaction to that.

<<4168.9;4177.1;en>>
I believe the counsel for the applicant made this statement, again reiterated the statement, even in his submissions.

<<4177.1;4199.7;en>>
The second question is, and I ask this question because I don't know what the position is in Ireland totally, is apart from suing the bishop or the archbishop, which my colleague has just mentioned, is there the possibility of suing instead the diocese or the archdiocese as a juridical person?

<<4199.7;4206.06;en>>
In other words, not the bishop in his individual capacity.

<<4206.06;4210.62;en>>
I wonder if I could have some clarification on that point.

<<4210.62;4210.62;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4211.66;4213.3;en>>
Thank you.

<<4213.3;4214.72;en>>
Any other questions?

<<4214.72;4215.96;en>>
No.

<<4215.96;4234.98;en>>
The court will now rise for 15 minutes, following which the parties will return for a second round of short pleadings to respond to the submissions in the first round and to answer the judges' questions.

<<4234.98;4234.98;en>>
The hearing is suspended.

<<4316.1;4318.7;en>>
Please be seated.

<<4318.7;4319.98;en>>
The hearing is resumed.

<<4319.98;4320.98;en>>
I call Mr. Holland.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<4324.93;4332.29;en>>
Members of the Court, if I could first address Mr. Justice Charlton's question as to the,

<<4332.29;4340.21;en>>
he used the phrase, a phrase, as to the alleged immunity of the master, or the headmaster.

<<4340.21;4351.65;en>>
And I think first I should say that we haven't asserted, nor need we, that the master was immune from the consequences of his acts.

<<4351.65;4376.69;en>>
And in that light, may I say, when you're reading the Ferguson report, I'd invite you, and I don't think this is unfair of me, albeit it is somewhat speculative, I'd invite you to bear in mind and ask yourselves the question, what would Ferguson have written if he had had possession of the Ryan Report, which of course had not yet been published?

<<4376.69;4380.85;en>>
So I don't say the master was immune.

<<4380.85;4386.21;en>>
And the phrase, sweep under the carpet, is not our phrase.

<<4386.21;4388.65;en>>
It comes from the Ryan Report.

<<4388.65;4392.37;en>>
I was quoting the Ryan Report directly.

<<4392.37;4397.37;en>>
And we do not say that the master perceived no risk.

<<4397.37;4399.81;en>>
Of course he perceived a risk.

<<4399.81;4407.17;en>>
But he clearly took the view that it was a low risk which he could take.

<<4407.17;4421.69;en>>
And he was proved right, not merely for the decade of his abuse in that school, but for the following 20 and odd years before in 1995 he was finally exposed.

<<4425.73;4431.81;en>>
The issue in this case is not whether the master felt immune.

<<4431.81;4457.37;en>>
In fact, the issue in this case, as I've tried, I hope to emphasize, is why once he was exposed in 1971 to the manager, the manager, it seems, was not in receipt of any training or background or instruction which would have led him to tell the department of the complaint.

<<4457.37;4461.09;en>>
That's my answer to Mr. Justice Charleston's first question.

<<4461.09;4476.69;en>>
As to the second question regarding the O'Byrne letter, I hope without being unfair, I can deal with that and Judge D'Agatano's question as to suing the bishop together.

<<4476.69;4485.77;en>>
An O'Byrne letter is a common law rule, I think is fair to say.

<<4485.77;4487.65;en>>
A practice is probably a better word for it.

<<4487.65;4490.33;en>>
It's not in the rules of court or anything like that.

<<4490.33;4505.09;en>>
But it is a practice in which the Irish courts have said, if you have a number of possible defendants and you believe all of them may be liable or some and you're not sure which, you write them all a letter saying, we're going to sue all of you.

<<4505.09;4520.41;en>>
And if we fail against one, we'll seek to have the costs which are recovered against us by that one in turn recovered from the defendant against whom we succeed.

<<4520.41;4523.41;en>>
And a couple of things are to be noted about those letters.

<<4523.41;4527.85;en>>
The first is they are matters of discretion in the court.

<<4527.85;4531.69;en>>
At the end of the case, out come the O'Byrne letters.

<<4531.69;4538.23;en>>
And the court may or may not decide to adjust the costs accordingly.

<<4538.23;4554.87;en>>
And one of the issues which the courts will consider in making that discretionary decision is whether in reality there was any proper basis at all for suing the successful defendant.

<<4554.87;4577.85;en>>
And in this case, and this addresses, I hope, Judge D'Agetano's question, Irish law, as we have said in our submission, was perfectly clear that a bishop is not a corporation sold, which means that one bishop is not liable for his predecessor's wrongs.

<<4577.85;4580.73;en>>
That is the state of Irish law.

<<4580.73;4590.17;en>>
Now, the state says correctly that many bishops have not raised that issue in litigation.

<<4590.17;4593.39;en>>
They do so, as indeed I think Mr. Justice Kagan said,

<<4593.39;4599.15;en>>
often out of a sense of honor, which does them credit.

<<4599.15;4609.01;en>>
But this bishop in this case chose to do that by his letter.

<<4609.01;4624.77;en>>
And correctly, counsel, as it happens it wasn't me, advised at the very start of the proceedings, don't sue the bishop because he has in law a complete defense.

<<4624.77;4639.29;en>>
I can't say whether he considered the O'Byrne letter issue, but I can say that had I been advising, I would have said, an O'Byrne letter might give you certain comfort or protection or a reasonable hope that it would work out.

<<4639.29;4648.81;en>>
But it is by no means, an O'Byrne letter is not a license for unwarranted proceedings against defendants who have an absolute defense.

<<4648.81;4652.29;en>>
And the matter goes further.

<<4652.29;4657.09;en>>
As things turned out, we lost against the state but succeeded against Mr. Hickey.

<<4657.09;4660.15;en>>
So what would have happened had we sued the bishop and failed?

<<4660.15;4670.33;en>>
We'd have got an order for costs against us in favor of the bishop and what's called an order over for those costs against Mr. Hickey.

<<4670.33;4675.33;en>>
The bishop would have come to us looking for his costs, would have had to pay him.

<<4675.33;4682.45;en>>
We'd have looked for them in turn for Mr. Hickey, who hasn't the capacity to pay them.

<<4682.45;4688.21;en>>
So we would have been significantly prejudiced, even had the O'Byrne letter been active.

<<4688.21;4703.21;en>>
And then to come back and finish my reply to Judge Chitana's question, in Ireland, the diocese of the Roman Catholic Church do not have legal standing as legal entities.

<<4703.21;4711.45;en>>
They are not, in the Irish phrase, corporations, sole, and they cannot be sued in that capacity.

<<4711.45;4717.97;en>>
And I made this point, in fact, in my submissions because the Canadian cases point up the distinction.

<<4717.97;4727.29;en>>
In Canada, the diocese, at least in certain states of Canada, does have legal status as a corporation.

<<4727.29;4730.85;en>>
But that was brought about by legislation.

<<4730.85;4735.61;en>>
And I think Dolan Bennett's legislation in the early 1900s.

<<4735.61;4745.17;en>>
So legislation was required to give the diocese a status such that it had capacity to be sued and perpetual succession.

<<4745.17;4749.41;en>>
There is no such statute in Ireland.

<<4749.41;4752.23;en>>
Finally, if I may come back to Mr. Justice Charlton's

<<4752.23;4777.81;en>>
question about Stay Safe, the 1999 standard, and indeed the later standard, I think Children First, which has been updated from time to time, I do not make the anachronistic argument that we must apply to 1973 the standards of 1999, or indeed the standards of today.

<<4777.81;4795.21;en>>
Clearly, understanding of sexual abuse and how to deal with it has developed enormously through bitter experience over the last decades in every country contracting party to this state.

<<4795.21;4825.41;en>>
But that is not an argument for saying that in 1973, the state was entitled to do nothing, to have no practices, to have no guidelines, to have no instructions to managers about an issue which they had identified in criminal law as posing a grave risk to children under 14, in the case of the particular instance identified by Mr. Justice Charlton.

<<4825.41;4854.41;en>>
And that is where I come back to the tragedy of this case, that all in the end we ask of the state in this case is that it would have had nothing more, in fact, given the 1971 complaint of a practice, a guideline, requiring that these matters be reported by managers in receipt of such complaints to the state.

<<4854.41;4863.13;en>>
That is not a burden of great weight, nor does it depend on anachronistic standards of today.

<<4863.13;4876.49;en>>
It is a standard perfectly reasonable to expect of a state in the early 1970s.

<<4876.49;4876.49;en>>
I'm most obliged to the Court.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4881.4;4883.74;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Holland.

<<4883.74;4883.74;en>>
I call Mr. Mc Donagh, please.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<4886.69;4887.85;en>>
Thank you, President.

<<4887.85;4894.57;en>>
If I could just address specifically the questions that have been posed, first of all, before then making a couple of more general observations.

<<4894.57;4897.71;en>>
In response to the first question of Ms. Justice

<<4897.71;4914.21;en>>
Charlton about any other examples of where individuals might be paid a salary and the state would not be vicariously liable, the one that comes to mind in the Irish context is a consultant doctor or surgeon in a hospital who is paid a salary by the state, but I don't believe sort of any agreement in that regard.

<<4914.21;4918.97;en>>
The state would be vicariously liable for any negligence which resulted from that.

<<4918.97;4923.49;en>>
That's the only concrete example that has come to mind just in the last few minutes.

<<4923.49;4938.13;en>>
In response to the second question as to whether could a teacher, by sexually abusing a child absent negligence, give rise to vicarious liability on the part of somebody else, I think the close connection test, which Mr. Justice

<<4938.13;4947.75;en>>
Fennelly, in the main judgment, if one could say that, in the Irish Supreme Court, in the applicant's case, indicated that that was certainly possible.

<<4947.75;4952.69;en>>
It would require a close example, a close examination of the precise circumstances.

<<4952.69;4961.45;en>>
He certainly didn't rule out that possibility, and a close examination, a close examination of a situation could give rise to such liability.

<<4961.45;4972.45;en>>
Because the school or the bishop weren't sued in these proceedings, weren't party to the Irish proceedings, there obviously was no finding against them, but certainly that is flagged as a possibility.

<<4972.45;4989.41;en>>
In response to the third question, what I was the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1935, I was specifically thinking of Section 14, which removes the defense of mistaken as to age in the context of indecent assault.

<<4989.41;4996.49;en>>
So in that sense, the Act certainly made it much easier to prosecute an indecent assault charge for a girl under the age of 15.

<<4996.49;5004.17;en>>
There are other specific offenses created by that Act in replacement of earlier offenses, but that seems the most relevant one.

<<5004.17;5011.77;en>>
But the Act, over a course of quite a number of sections, implements other recommendations of the Carrigan Report as well.

<<5011.77;5021.21;en>>
In response to the question from Judge Gattano, the guidance note which is there, of course, we say is not ineffectual or ineffective.

<<5021.21;5026.85;en>>
And not only do we say that, but the evidence in the High Court from Mr. Ordlannan,

<<5026.85;5034.09;en>>
the inspector, who ended up, I think, as chief inspector many years later, but his evidence was completely consistent with that note.

<<5034.09;5039.57;en>>
His evidence as to what would happen in the context of a matter being brought to his attention was entirely consistent with that note.

<<5039.57;5048.33;en>>
And, therefore, that note, first of all, reflects current practice, and then, in a number of moderate respects, amends that practice.

<<5048.33;5052.29;en>>
But it recognizes, in the first instance, the existence of a practice.

<<5052.29;5061.01;en>>
And there's no real challenge to that in the Irish High Court as to what would happen, and, therefore, that note reflects the practice.

<<5061.01;5065.93;en>>
And there was no effective challenge to that in the Irish context.

<<5065.93;5069.69;en>>
Coming to the other question about suing a diocese, that raises an interesting question.

<<5069.69;5075.25;en>>
I don't necessarily agree with my friend that the issue is crystal clear, as he suggests.

<<5075.25;5083.65;en>>
It is the case that in a number of other jurisdictions, dioceses have been made into limited corporations or limited companies.

<<5083.65;5086.25;en>>
That doesn't happen in Ireland.

<<5086.25;5090.89;en>>
My friend, Mr. Holland, suggests that perhaps bishops have settled cases

<<5090.89;5093.89;en>>
because of a sense of moral responsibility.

<<5093.89;5101.21;en>>
But, of course, there are other reasons why they might settle cases, and they may relate to the fact they believe they may ultimately be found liable.

<<5101.21;5104.49;en>>
Issues of canon law don't necessarily concern this court.

<<5104.49;5112.37;en>>
But certainly, a diocese over which a bishop presides has a certain status in that regard.

<<5112.37;5116.13;en>>
There is no Irish decision actually on the issue in Ireland.

<<5116.13;5128.07;en>>
What I think I can say is that many bishops, I don't think my friend will dispute this, will initially deny liability, even in those cases which have been settled, a letter will be sent denying liability.

<<5128.07;5145.49;en>>
That does not mean that that point will ever actually be taken, and, in fact, has never, I believe, been taken in a court hearing in Ireland, that one bishop is saying, I'm not responsible for the actions of somebody occurring under the watch of my predecessor.

<<5145.49;5170.13;en>>
In terms of what seems to be the core of the applicant's case, I would simply point out that, of course, in this case, it was absolutely clear to the manager or the acting manager of the school that, in terms of the 1971 complaint which was made, that this was a criminal offense.

<<5170.13;5174.01;en>>
And the manager doesn't seem to have gone to the police about it.

<<5174.01;5180.37;en>>
The rules for national schools clearly indicate that teachers have to act in a spirit of obedience to the law, rule 121.

<<5180.37;5194.97;en>>
If the manager didn't do that and didn't go to the police in those circumstances, I don't think my friend can seriously suggest that, in this instance, the department in some way caused or brought about what happened.

<<5194.97;5201.01;en>>
The reality is the manager was, in the Irish settlement, the Irish context, the person running the school.

<<5201.01;5215.57;en>>
And it would be certainly the submission of the government that the significant evidence he failed in his obligations, that has not been tested in the Irish courts because he wasn't brought into the proceedings.

<<5215.57;5218.09;en>>
And there the matter rests from the Irish perspective.

<<5218.09;5223.97;en>>
I should say also my friend again goes back to the letter of the bishop where he was denying liability.

<<5223.97;5232.49;en>>
And at the risk of repetition, I'll simply say that he denied liability certainly on the initial basis that he couldn't be held responsible for his predecessor.

<<5232.49;5240.13;en>>
But he was equally emphatic that he could not possibly be liable because vicarious liability couldn't arise in respect of acts of sexual abuse.

<<5240.13;5248.73;en>>
And yet the applicant was perfectly happy to pursue that against the minister and argue because the contrary.

<<5248.73;5255.01;en>>
In the law in 1999 was very much what it could be said, the bishop said it was.

<<5255.01;5258.33;en>>
The bishop actually cited an English case, an English court of appeal.

<<5258.33;5268.57;en>>
He actually cited the name of an English judge, Lady Justice Butler-Schloss, and suggested that the law was clear that there couldn't be vicarious liability for sexual abuse.

<<5268.57;5270.01;en>>
And yet that was challenged.

<<5270.01;5276.41;en>>
So we say clearly there should have been involved in the proceedings further.

<<5276.41;5277.97;en>>
And it is not as clear as my friend suggests.

<<5283.63;5286.69;en>>
I would simply then go back as a final observation.

<<5286.69;5301.43;en>>
Not withstanding what appears to us to be a significant concession or admission on the part of the applicant that the Irish school system and the way it operates doesn't contribute in any way to the case they seek to make before this court.

<<5301.43;5319.47;en>>
Yet my friend began his submissions just perhaps an hour or an hour and a half ago by saying that the abuser was invested by the state with awesome power. That's how he began his submission. He was not, this man, invested

<<5319.47;5325.55;en>>
by the state with awesome power. And that point, which is repeated in the written observations,

<<5325.55;5331.59;en>>
now seems not to form part of the applicant's case. The state did not invest this man with

<<5331.59;5334.57;en>>
power. May I please the court.

<<57.46;58.22;en>>
Please be seated.

<<67.9;76.6;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the admissibility and merits in the case of El-Masri against former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

<<77.88;88.56;en>>
The case was lodged with the court on the 20th of July 2009 under Article 34 of the Convention by a German national, Mr. Khaled El-Masri.

<<88.56;96.1;en>>
The application was allocated to the fifth section of the court pursuant to Rule 52, paragraph 1 of the Rules of Court.

<<96.1;107.18;en>>
On the 1st of February 2011, the court changed the composition of its sections and the case was assigned to the newly composed first section under Rule 52, paragraph 1.

<<107.18;113.06;en>>
The application was communicated to the government on the 28th of September 2010.

<<113.06;126.02;en>>
Having received the party's submissions, the chamber decided on the 24th of January 2012 to relinquish jurisdiction in favor of the Grand Chamber, none of the parties having objected to relinquishment.

<<126.02;132.46;en>>
The government are represented by their agent, Mr. Kostadin Bogdanov, assisted by Ms. Danica

<<132.46;143.26;en>>
Djonova and Ms. Veronika Stanojevska from the Ministry of Justice, by Ms. Nadica Josifova

<<143.26;150.08;en>>
from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and by Ms. Natalija Tasevska, public prosecutor

<<150.08;151.94;en>>
as advisors.

<<151.94;156.94;en>>
The applicant is represented by Mr. James A. Goldson, Executive Director of the Open

<<156.94;163.42;en>>
Society Justice Initiative, assisted by Mr. Darian Pavli and Mr. Rupert Skilbeck, both

<<163.42;170.3;en>>
from the Open Society Justice Initiative, and by Mr. Filip Medarski as advisors.

<<170.3;174.32;en>>
I welcome the representatives of the parties in the name of the court.

<<174.32;192.78;en>>
I would also like to welcome a visiting delegation from the Supreme Judiciary of Bulgaria on a study visit to the Council of Europe, a visiting delegation of judges of the Constitutional Court of Romania, a visiting delegation of judges and lawyers from Serbia, as well as all other visiting groups.

<<192.78;200.06;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and the representative of the applicant, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<200.06;204.94;en>>
Mr. Bogdanov for the government will speak first, and then Mr. Goldson and Mr. Pavli for

<<204.94;206.7;en>>
the applicant.

<<206.7;224.8;en>>
I would explain that in addition to interpretation into the two official languages of the court, English and French, interpretation into Macedonian, Bulgarian, and Russian has been authorized for the benefit of the delegations from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, from Russia, and from Bulgaria.

<<224.8;233.66;en>>
That interpretation is not arranged by the court, and no transcription of the interpretation will be included in the official record of the proceedings.

<<233.66;234.66;en>>
I call Mr. Bogdanov.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<238.47;241.02;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<241.02;244.26;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<244.26;265.62;en>>
ladies and gentlemen, the six-month time limit set forth in Article 35, Paragraph 1 of the Convention serves to prevent the compatibility of a national decision, action, or omission with the Convention being questioned after a considerable lapse of time by the submission of an application to the court.

<<265.62;280.38;en>>
It reflects the wish of the contracting parties to prevent past decisions being called into question after a long period of time, therefore serving the interest of legal certainty as a value in itself.

<<280.38;307.5;en>>
Recently, these principles were reaffirmed by the Brighton Declaration, where the conference reiterated the importance of the court applying fully, consistently, and foreseeably all the admissibility criteria, including the rules regarding the scope of the court jurisdiction, both to ensure the efficient application of justice and to safeguard the respective roles of the court and the national authorities.

<<307.5;322.14;en>>
Furthermore, the strict and consistent application of the admissibility criteria contributes to the strength of the Convention system by ensuring that unnecessary pressure is not placed on the court's workload.

<<322.14;342.43;en>>
The government of Macedonia embraces the consistent and foreseeable approach taken by the court so far in applying the six-month rule to cases relating to acts or events violating Articles 2, 3, or 5, or 5 taken alone or in conjunction with Article 13 of the Convention.

<<342.43;362.82;en>>
In this respect, the court in a number of cases concerning ongoing investigations has examined the period of time from which the applicant can or should start adopting the effectiveness of a remedy and is bearing on the six-month limit provided for in Article 35, Paragraph 1 of the Convention.

<<362.82;384.23;en>>
Determination of such a period by the court depends on the circumstances of each case and factors, such as the diligence and the interest displayed by the applicants in pursuing the avenues of redress and informing themselves about the progress made in the investigation, as well as the adequacy of the investigation in question.

<<384.23;399.23;en>>
According to the well-established case law of this court, the diligence in this regard must be seen as demonstrated, active stance on the part of the applicants towards the investigation by perceiving the investigation as effective.

<<399.23;417.11;en>>
Taking into account the above-mentioned principles, the government respectfully submits that due to the applicant's lack of diligence, which consisted in his own negligence, the application in question has been introduced out of the court's temporal jurisdiction within the meaning of the six-month rule.

<<417.11;426.26;en>>
Therefore, the application in question should be declared as inadmissible under Article 35, Paragraph 1 of the Convention.

<<426.26;441.87;en>>
The government invites the court to conclude that the applicant must have become aware of the ineffectiveness of the investigation long before he lodged the criminal complaint and more than six months before he lodged the application to the court.

<<441.87;444.5;en>>
Mr. President, the applicant alleges

<<444.5;454.16;en>>
that he was abducted by the Macedonian forces on 31st of December, 2003 in contravention of Article 3, 5, and 8 of the Convention.

<<454.16;460.42;en>>
The applicant further alleges that he was ultimately released on 28th of May, 2004.

<<460.42;480.9;en>>
The government notes that since 2004 until the end of 2008, when the applicant filed a criminal complaint, the applicant remained totally passive and displayed no initiative in informing the law enforcement authorities in Macedonia that a crime had been committed against him.

<<480.9;486.87;en>>
Instead, throughout this period, the applicant pursued remedies in other jurisdictions.

<<486.87;494.11;en>>
Namely, in May 2004, the applicant initiated criminal proceedings in Germany on charges of kidnapping.

<<494.11;502.62;en>>
The proceedings ultimately resulted in issuing arrest warrants against 13 presumed CIA agents in January 2007.

<<502.62;512.99;en>>
In December 2005, the applicant filed a civil claim in the US courts, alleging that he had been deprived of liberty in absence of legal process.

<<512.99;520.55;en>>
The claim was finally dismissed in October 2007 by a decision of the US Supreme Court not to review the case.

<<520.55;531.54;en>>
According to the applicant, the choice to initiate proceedings in the US instead of Macedonia was that he viewed the US government as the party primarily responsible for his unjust suffering.

<<534.98;542.42;en>>
The applicant's allegations were also subject to several international inquiries during 2006 and 2007.

<<542.42;549.22;en>>
Those inquiries were conducted by the Council of Europe, the European Parliament, and were political in nature.

<<549.22;555.66;en>>
The Macedonian government took active participation into those inquiries.

<<555.66;566.37;en>>
It is worth noting, however, that according to this court, international inquiries as such cannot be regarded as part of the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies.

<<566.37;577.18;en>>
The inquiries conducted in 2006 and 2007 were not able to award compensation or make any findings of violations of the convention.

<<577.18;589.87;en>>
It is striking that the applicant did not make recourse to even one remedy in the respondent's state in respect for his allegations for almost five years since the Alecce incident occurred.

<<589.87;608.14;en>>
Even if the applicant relied on the obligation on the part of the Macedonian authorities to investigate his allegations with their own motion, the ineffectiveness of this avenue must have become clear to the applicant long before 6th of October 2008, the date when he lodged the criminal complaint.

<<608.14;615.87;en>>
First, due to the absence of any contact between him and the law enforcement authorities for almost five years.

<<615.87;628.37;en>>
Second, due to the fact that the Macedonian public prosecutor did not instigate ex-officio investigation, despite information becoming available to him from his German counterpart.

<<628.37;644.98;en>>
Namely, in the course of the German investigation, the competent public prosecutor requested with a letter of attorney from the Macedonian public prosecutor to take investigative steps regarding the applicant's allegations and to provide answers to the specific questions.

<<644.98;651.14;en>>
This was done on two occasions, in May 2005 and in November 2007.

<<651.14;666.14;en>>
Acting under Article 152, paragraph 2 of the criminal procedural code, the Macedonian prosecutor replied, providing information based on the inquiries conducted by the Ministry of Interior.

<<666.14;670.38;en>>
Mr. President, should the court accept the applicant's claim

<<670.38;688.59;en>>
that he did not pursue the remedies in respect of his grievances in due time because he considered that those remedies were ineffective, then the government is on the opinion that the applicant must be considered to have been aware of this situation long before October 2008.

<<688.59;702.03;en>>
If, as he alleges, he did not become aware of this situation until January 2009, the court should consider that that was due to his lack of diligence, which consisted in his own negligence.

<<702.03;716.87;en>>
The government sees no reason which could have forced the applicant to choose to wait so long before lodging the criminal complaint, save for his own belief that such an action would be meaningless.

<<716.87;725.54;en>>
The applicant has not been in any manner placed outside the protection of the national or international law during the relevant period.

<<725.54;736.54;en>>
Furthermore, he had direct domestic access to the investigative authorities, and throughout the entire period in question, he was assisted by legal representatives.

<<736.54;753.52;en>>
The arguments of the applicant that he did not speak the local language or that he did not have practical ability to travel to Macedonia and was not able to afford a local lawyer for several years should not be regarded as specific circumstances according to the case law of this court.

<<753.52;772.7;en>>
The argument of the applicant that he was entitled to await the outcome of the international inquiries should not be regarded as specific circumstance either, since those inquiries did not lead to any finding of fact which would be of relevance as to the existence of any available remedies in domestic law.

<<772.7;785.95;en>>
Ultimately, the international inquiry conducted by the Council of Europe was concluded in June 2006, and that is more than two years before the applicant lodged the criminal complaint in October 2008.

<<785.95;795.83;en>>
The inquiry conducted by the European Parliament was concluded in January 2007, and that is almost two years before the applicant lodged the criminal complaint.

<<795.83;805.5;en>>
The arrest warrants in the course of the proceedings in Germany were issued in January 2007, and that is almost two years before the applicant lodged the criminal complaint.

<<805.5;812.26;en>>
The procedure before the US courts was also finalized in January 2007.

<<812.26;821.26;en>>
The argument of the applicant that throughout the period in question he conducted his own evidence gathering is unsubstantiated.

<<821.26;846.83;en>>
The documents submitted in support of his application reveal that he made only one submission to the Macedonian authorities, and that is the request address to the Civil Aviation Authority in May 2008 after more than four years since the alleged incident occurred, and after more than one year after all international inquiries and investigations were concluded.

<<846.83;850.26;en>>
The request has been promptly replied.

<<850.26;859.14;en>>
Accordingly, this activity was neither time-consuming nor required considerable effort on the part of the applicant.

<<859.14;875.99;en>>
In line with the court's practice, the government concludes that no specific circumstances existed prior to submission of the application to the court, which might have prevented the applicant from observing the time limit laid down in Article 35, Paragraph 1 of the Convention.

<<875.99;879.34;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<879.34;891.22;en>>
with the passage of time, the applicant must have become aware of the lack of an effective official investigation, this becoming gradually apparent to him up until October 2008.

<<891.23;911.25;en>>
After almost five years since the alleged incident occurred, he decides to avail himself on a criminal complaint against unnamed personnel from the Ministry of Interior under Article 140, Paragraphs 1 and 3, and Article 142, Paragraph 1 of the Macedonian Penal Code.

<<911.25;922.27;en>>
The effectiveness, or better said, the ineffectiveness of this remedy pursued by the applicant derives from the legal provisions contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure.

<<922.27;936.15;en>>
Namely, according to the law, as long as the perpetrator renames unnamed, the complainant does not gain victim status, and he may not take over prosecution and appear as a subsidiary complainant.

<<936.15;941.87;en>>
Thus, the complainant is not entitled to challenge the dismissal decision.

<<941.87;962.34;en>>
Once a criminal complaint is submitted against an unnamed perpetrator, according to the Article 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the public prosecutor requests the Ministry of Interior to gather necessary information and undertake other measures aimed at identifying the criminal offense and the perpetrator.

<<962.34;975.58;en>>
In the applicant's case, the Ministry of Interior has already acted twice upon request of the public prosecutor in 2006 and 2008 by virtue of Article 152.

<<975.58;988.5;en>>
The applicant and his representatives should have been aware that by availing to this criminal complaint as a remedy, the Ministry of Interior would be again requested to act upon.

<<988.5;1010.26;en>>
The criminal complaint was dismissed by the principal public prosecutor in Skopje with decision dated 18th of December 2008 on the ground that there were no grounds for suspicion that the offenses were committed by an unnamed perpetrator due to the lack of sufficient evidence supporting the allegations of the complainant.

<<1010.26;1027.11;en>>
This decision was not forwarded to the applicant in line with the established practice of the Macedonian prosecution authorities and out of the reason that the applicant did not gain the victim status and he could not take over prosecution appearing as a subsidiary complainant.

<<1027.11;1042.38;en>>
Moreover, such decision cannot be challenged by an appeal because the dismissal as such does not mean that the obligation for the prosecutor to take further measures and activities regarding the identification of the perpetrators has ceased.

<<1042.38;1053.07;en>>
However, the applicant was not discharged from the duty to display due diligence and initiative in informing himself about the progress made in the investigation.

<<1053.07;1063.7;en>>
There is no information in the file to suggest that the applicant made any attempt to take part in the investigation or to obtain information about its progress.

<<1063.7;1075.11;en>>
It is striking that the applicant gained knowledge of the steps taken in the course of his criminal complaint from the written observations of the government submitted to this court in January 2011.

<<1075.11;1087.7;en>>
This affirms that the applicant did not undertake any initiative in informing himself about the progress made for more than two years after the complaint was lodged in October 2008.

<<1087.7;1108.62;en>>
One may arguably claim that if the applicant performed the requisite initiative after petitioning the principal public prosecutor, he could at least have become aware that the prosecutions for the offices allegedly committed against him were not statutory-beared in Macedonia on 24th of January 2009.

<<1108.62;1122.11;en>>
Namely, the applicant lodged a criminal complaint alleging offices under Article 140, Paragraph 3, in conjunction with Paragraph 1 and Article 142, Paragraph 1 of the Macedonian Penal Code.

<<1122.11;1137.42;en>>
However, the principal public prosecutor, as obvious from the dismissal decision, qualified the alleged offices under Article 140, Paragraph 3 and Article 142, Paragraph 2 of the Macedonian Penal Code.

<<1137.42;1146.42;en>>
According to the law enforced at the relevant time, the maximum punishment under Article 142, Paragraph 2 was 10 years.

<<1146.42;1155.03;en>>
Consequently, the prosecution becomes time-beared in 10 years, taken from the date of commission of the alleged offense under this article.

<<1155.03;1164.87;en>>
Finally, the applicant's negligence is also apparent from his conduct with regard to the civil procedure for damages initiated at the beginning of 2009.

<<1164.87;1175.38;en>>
Despite several court requests, the applicant for more than three years has not appeared before the domestic court to be examined as a party of the procedure.

<<1175.38;1178.66;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<1178.66;1188.11;en>>
the court can nevertheless consider and pass judgment on any alleged investigative failures by the authorities to pursue new leads.

<<1188.11;1196.24;en>>
In the applicant's view, there are two issues which can be perceived by the court as new leads triggering the respondent's state duty to investigate.

<<1196.24;1202.07;en>>
First, the criminal complaint against the unknown perpetrator of October 2008.

<<1202.07;1210.95;en>>
And second, the written statement of the witness deposited in March 2010 and submitted to this court a year later.

<<1210.95;1214.83;en>>
The government respectfully disagrees with this view.

<<1214.83;1232.38;en>>
The applicant submits that should the court find the application out of time at any point before October 2008, then in alternative, his criminal complaint should be considered as a revival of the Macedonian's duty to investigate, restarting the six-month clock under the Brecknell and Gassiak holdings.

<<1232.38;1250.9;en>>
However, the evidence presented in support of the criminal complaint of 2008 did not cast new light on the circumstances complained of and consequently did not lead to significant new developments which were not already brought into the public domain prior to that date.

<<1250.9;1266.61;en>>
On the contrary, the alleged new, compelling, and comprehensive evidence accompanying the criminal complaint of October 2008 consisted of, first, the Marti report, which was published and publicly available already in 2006.

<<1266.61;1272.07;en>>
Second, the Fava report, published and publicly available already in 2007.

<<1272.07;1279.22;en>>
Third, the declarations of the applicant himself and his lawyer, which were publicly known as early as 2004.

<<1279.22;1286.59;en>>
Fourth, the isotopic appraisal of the applicant's hair conducted in 2005 and explained in details in the Marti report.

<<1286.59;1313.87;en>>
And fifth, the flight logs for flight N313P, which were placed in public domain as early as January 2005 when the then leading audiovisual provider in Macedonia reported in Terralia that on 23rd of January 2004, an American Boeing landed in Skopje from Palma and two hours later left for Kabul, Afghanistan with only one passenger on the board.

<<1313.87;1321.27;en>>
The flight logs for flight N313P were also explained in details in the Marti report.

<<1321.27;1340.62;en>>
The government states that if the court considers, by any reason, that the applicant submitted new information which casts new light on the circumstances, then it should take into account that according to its established case law, not every assertion or allegation can trigger a fresh investigative obligation.

<<1340.62;1354.03;en>>
Only plausible or credible allegation, piece of evidence, or item of information relevant to the identification and eventual prosecution or punishment of the perpetrator may revive the obligation.

<<1354.03;1356.35;en>>
Such is not the case here.

<<1356.35;1377.38;en>>
In this respect, the government argues that the only plausible explanation for asserting to the criminal complaint by the applicant in October 2008, after almost five years since the alleged incident occurred, was the intention and interest of the applicant to try to satisfy the admissibility criteria of this court.

<<1377.38;1380.19;en>>
Mr. President, I will now turn to the issue

<<1380.19;1388.19;en>>
as to whether the written statement of the witness in this case could be perceived as a new lead capable of triggering fresh investigation.

<<1388.19;1404.94;en>>
The court is confronted with a rather unusual challenge to decide on the duty of the respondent government to pursue further investigations in a situation where the purported new written evidence is submitted exclusively to the court with strong conditions underlying it.

<<1404.94;1421.02;en>>
The witness puts under condition the use of his written statement in a sense that it can only be used for the purposes of this court deliberations and may not be used in pursuit of any investigations against him or other individuals.

<<1421.02;1441.51;en>>
Furthermore, the applicant and his representatives requested the government to oblige not to pursue any legal action or other measures of any kind against this witness in respect or as a result of his statement, thus preventing the prosecution and judiciary from acting upon it.

<<1441.51;1448.99;en>>
The issue that arises in front of this court is to whether and in what form the procedural obligation to investigate is revived.

<<1448.99;1458.87;en>>
And that is whether and in what form the information provided by the witness in his statement submitted exclusively to this court amounted to new evidence.

<<1458.87;1478.7;en>>
In this connection, first and foremost, the government invites the court to take into account that the government is effectively under obligation by virtue of Article 34 of the Convention not to interfere in any way with the applicant's right to petition the court, including in relation to the statement, by refraining from harassment in any fashion.

<<1478.7;1489.35;en>>
On the other hand, this court's practice has established that it cannot be accepted that positive obligation should arise each time an item of new evidence comes into play.

<<1489.35;1505.2;en>>
The court applies a particular thorough scrutiny when assessing the supposed quality of any further item of information received vis-a-vis the information which was already in public domain and presumably within applicant's knowledge.

<<1505.2;1519.14;en>>
It is clear from the court's case law that the new credible allegation, piece of evidence, or item of information must be relevant to the identification, prosecution, or punishment of the perpetrator of an unlawful act.

<<1519.14;1529.66;en>>
In the present case, it cannot be established that those requirements are met without assessment of the credibility of the source and the evidence in question.

<<1529.66;1534.9;en>>
This is particular due to the fact that the statement was presented in written form.

<<1534.9;1552.87;en>>
The government acknowledges that any investigative measures will be perceived by the applicant on one hand and by the witness on the other as harassment and contravention to his conditions expressly underlined in the statement, thus underpinning the principles established by Article 34 of the Convention.

<<1552.87;1575.99;en>>
In conclusion, taking into account Article 34 and especially the circumstances surrounding the written statement, which cumulatively create obstacles of law and facts, the authorities of the respondent state were not in a position to take any preliminary steps into assessment of the credibility of the witness's allegations, nor to take any further investigative measures.

<<1575.99;1579.19;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<1579.19;1588.9;en>>
we believe that we have demonstrated that the application in front of us today is to be declared inadmissible according to Article 35, paragraph 1 of the Convention.

<<1588.9;1595.83;en>>
It has been submitted outside of the six-month time limit due to the applicant's own negligence.

<<1595.83;1604.59;en>>
In addition, we believe that we have established that there are no new leads capable of reviving the investigation into the applicant's allegations.

<<1604.59;1616.42;en>>
Therefore, the court is unable to take cognizance of the merits of the present case by the fact that the complaints under Article 3, 5, and 8 are outside its temporal jurisdiction.

<<1616.42;1631.79;en>>
Since the court is not in position, ratione temporis, to examine whether the applicant had an arguable claim, there being no arguable claim in such circumstances, the applicant's submission in respect of Article 13 also fall outside the court's competence.

<<1631.79;1632.69;en>>
I thank you for your attention.

<<1632.69;1632.7;en>>
Thank you.

<<1632.7;1632.7;en>>

<<1640.76;1642.46;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Bogdanov.

<<1642.46;1645.26;en>>
Then I call Mr. Goldson, please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<1649.0;1654.38;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President, distinguished judges of this court.

<<1654.38;1668.14;en>>
This case concerns the practice of extraordinary rendition, the secret and extra-legal detention and transfer of a person to another country for interrogation and often torture.

<<1668.14;1680.44;en>>
As this court has recently confirmed, by its deliberate circumvention of due process, extraordinary rendition is anathema to the rule of law and the values protected by the Convention.

<<1680.44;1689.0;en>>
We have heard from the government that the applicant was negligent, exhibited a lack of diligence and hence this case is not properly before this court.

<<1689.0;1694.84;en>>
We would submit that if ever there was a case which belongs before this court, this is it.

<<1694.84;1720.62;en>>
For almost five months during the first half of 2004, Khaled El Masri, a German citizen, husband and father, traveling to Macedonia, was unlawfully detained and abused by Macedonian authorities, then turned over to the custody of the United States Central Intelligence Agency, who held and brutalized him in a secret jail in Afghanistan.

<<1720.62;1734.84;en>>
This chain of abduction, torture and disappearance all took place outside the law as part of a joint Macedonian-U.S. operation involving a demonstrably innocent man.

<<1734.84;1741.32;en>>
Following his release, Mr. El Masri sought legal redress wherever he could, in Germany,

<<1741.32;1748.08;en>>
in Macedonia, in the United States, but in each instance his efforts were stymied.

<<1748.08;1756.76;en>>
To this day, Macedonia has not acknowledged the truth of what happened, let alone apologized or provided compensation.

<<1756.76;1769.36;en>>
During one of the darkest days of his detention at the Salt Pit, the CIA prison outside Kabul where he was held, Mr. El Masri was warned by one of his interrogators, where you are

<<1769.36;1777.32;en>>
right now, there is no law, no rights, no one knows you are here and no one cares about you.

<<1777.32;1783.96;en>>
Mr. El Masri has now come before this Court to prove otherwise.

<<1783.96;1787.64;en>>
Your Honors, the government of Macedonia says in essence three things.

<<1787.64;1790.64;en>>
First, don't believe Khaled El Masri.

<<1790.64;1793.72;en>>
Second, don't consider this case on the merits.

<<1793.72;1799.2;en>>
And thirdly, if you do, don't find this government's actions in breach of the Convention.

<<1799.2;1803.28;en>>
In the course of our presentation this morning, we will address each of these in turn.

<<1803.28;1809.44;en>>
First, we'll explain the evidence which conclusively shows that Mr. El Masri was unlawfully held

<<1809.44;1815.52;en>>
incommunicado, disappeared and mistreated by the Macedonian government.

<<1815.52;1822.46;en>>
Second we'll explain why this case is properly before this Court and why the Court should issue a judgment on the merits.

<<1822.46;1828.32;en>>
And finally, we'll demonstrate that the government is responsible for specific violations of the European Convention.

<<1828.32;1829.92;en>>
I will address the facts.

<<1829.92;1833.56;en>>
Mr. Pavli will deal with admissibility and Convention breaches.

<<1833.56;1837.48;en>>
And together with Mr. Skilbeck and Madarski, we'll be pleased to answer any questions that

<<1837.48;1838.8;en>>
you may have.

<<1838.8;1842.86;en>>
So what does the evidence show?

<<1842.86;1857.56;en>>
This matter presents the Court with what at first glance appears to be a stark factual dispute, one which owing to the failure of the Macedonian authorities to carry out an effective investigation, this Court must resolve.

<<1857.56;1863.92;en>>
And yet when one looks more closely, there is really no dispute in the evidence before you.

<<1863.92;1875.4;en>>
For despite this Court's requests, the government of Macedonia has consistently refused to explain in any detail or provide support for its categorical assertions.

<<1875.4;1884.32;en>>
Rather it has stuck to what the Council of Europe's Marti inquiry called an obviously false account of its actions.

<<1884.32;1890.32;en>>
Macedonia contends that its officials' only contact with Mr. Elmasri was for five hours

<<1890.32;1897.28;en>>
on the evening of 31 December 2003 at the Tavanovca border crossing from Serbia.

<<1897.28;1902.68;en>>
Following this, Mr. Elmasri is said to have entered the country voluntarily.

<<1902.68;1912.16;en>>
According to the government, his stay for 23 days at the Skopsje Merak hotel was, quote, free and upon his own choice.

<<1912.16;1916.4;en>>
He was, they say, not detained during this time.

<<1916.4;1921.72;en>>
Absent any factual basis, the government suggests that Mr. Elmasri did not leave Macedonia in

<<1921.72;1928.4;en>>
a CIA plane, but rather that he walked across the border upon his own will into Kosovo.

<<1928.4;1933.34;en>>
But there is no evidence that Mr. Elmasri went to Kosovo.

<<1933.34;1939.82;en>>
In fact, there is not a shred of credible evidence to buttress the government's version of events.

<<1939.82;1945.5;en>>
Those few records the government has provided in support of its case prove, if anything, the opposite.

<<1945.5;1951.54;en>>
For example, a Ministry of Interior note of Mr. Elmasri's entry interview at the border

<<1951.54;1959.74;en>>
was prepared after the fact, although it was apparently disguised to appear as if it had been created contemporaneously.

<<1959.74;1977.38;en>>
Each of the official bodies that has investigated this case, the Marti inquiry, the Fava inquiry of the European Parliament, the German prosecutor, the Spanish prosecutor, the German Bundestag, all have rejected as utterly untenable the explanations offered by the Macedonian government.

<<1977.38;1982.0;en>>
By contrast, there is a wealth of evidence that Mr. Elmasri was the victim of an extra

<<1982.0;1987.8;en>>
legal rendition in which Macedonia colluded with the United States.

<<1987.8;1990.8;en>>
First there are Mr. Elmasri's own words.

<<1990.8;1997.76;en>>
In a sworn affidavit, Mr. Elmasri said that he went to Macedonia toward the end of 2003

<<1997.76;2001.64;en>>
because sadly he needed some time away from his family.

<<2001.64;2004.08;en>>
He had been having marital problems.

<<2004.08;2010.64;en>>
He decided to take a break, and Macedonia was attractive because it was nearby and inexpensive.

<<2010.64;2019.6;en>>
He purchased a round-trip bus ticket from Ulm, his hometown, to Skopje.

<<2019.6;2024.92;en>>
But when Mr. Elmasri's bus arrived at the Serbian-Macedonian border, his passport, alone

<<2024.92;2029.4;en>>
among all the passengers on the bus, was not returned.

<<2029.4;2031.64;en>>
Mr. Elmasri was told to leave the bus.

<<2031.64;2038.04;en>>
He was questioned by Macedonian officials at the border, and then he was taken to the Skopje Merak Hotel.

<<2038.04;2048.84;en>>
As the Marti report noted, this is consistent with a common practice in Macedonia of using non-jail locations to hide detainees in plain sight.

<<2048.84;2050.0;en>>
Why?

<<2050.0;2054.44;en>>
To make unlawful actions plausibly deniable.

<<2054.44;2058.68;en>>
For three days, Mr. Elmasri was interrogated repeatedly in English.

<<2058.68;2066.48;en>>
His requests for a translator and to contact the German embassy, a lawyer, or his family were all refused.

<<2066.48;2071.12;en>>
When he tried to leave, he was threatened with a gun pointed at his head.

<<2071.12;2081.36;en>>
Still later, during his hotel detention, he was promised that he could return to Germany if he would say that he belonged to Al-Qaeda, which he did not, so he refused.

<<2081.36;2094.08;en>>
On the 23rd of January, 2004, after 23 days of incommunicado detention, the Macedonian authorities transferred Mr. Elmasri to the custody of the CIA at the airport in Skopje.

<<2094.08;2100.48;en>>
Mr. Elmasri has described in compelling detail, detail that only someone who actually experienced

<<2100.48;2111.88;en>>
these events would know what happened when he arrived at the airport and was told that he would be given a medical examination before being returned to Germany.

<<2111.88;2116.2;en>>
Quote, I felt two people violently grab my arms.

<<2116.2;2118.94;en>>
I was beaten severely from all sides.

<<2118.94;2124.8;en>>
I then felt someone else grab my head with both hands, so I was unable to move.

<<2124.8;2127.02;en>>
Others sliced my clothes off.

<<2127.02;2129.0;en>>
I was left in my underwear.

<<2129.0;2131.14;en>>
In this, they attempted to take off.

<<2131.14;2137.32;en>>
I tried to resist at first, shouting out loudly for them to stop, but my efforts were in vain.

<<2137.32;2139.98;en>>
The pain from the beatings was severe.

<<2139.98;2142.74;en>>
I was terrified and utterly humiliated.

<<2142.74;2148.26;en>>
My assailants continued to beat me, and finally they stripped me completely naked and threw me to the ground.

<<2148.26;2152.88;en>>
I then felt a stick or some other hard object being forced in my anus.

<<2152.88;2155.86;en>>
I realized I was being sodomized.

<<2155.86;2161.54;en>>
Of all the acts that these men perpetrated, this was the most degrading and shameful.

<<2161.54;2163.38;en>>
End quote.

<<2163.38;2167.38;en>>
Mr. El-Masri was then dressed in a diaper and blindfolded.

<<2167.38;2168.96;en>>
His ears were plugged.

<<2168.96;2173.1;en>>
A bag was placed over his head, which made it hard for him to breathe.

<<2173.1;2175.58;en>>
He was thrown down on the floor of an airplane.

<<2175.58;2181.82;en>>
His arms and legs were spread-eagled, and his ankles were shackled to the sides of the plane.

<<2181.82;2184.22;en>>
He was then drugged by injection.

<<2184.22;2186.66;en>>
Some hours later, he landed in Kabul.

<<2186.66;2190.94;en>>
He was kept there in a filthy, unheated cell for the next four months.

<<2190.94;2206.1;en>>
Thirty-seven days into a hunger strike that he launched to protest his mistreatment, he was forcibly fed by hooded men who dragged him from his bed, bound his hands and feet, and stuffed a tube up his nose through which liquid was sent.

<<2206.1;2211.9;en>>
And finally, on the 28th of May, Mr. El-Masri was reverse-rendered to Albania, where he

<<2211.9;2218.02;en>>
was told not to tell anybody what had happened to him, and then placed on a commercial flight back to Germany.

<<2218.02;2221.66;en>>
That in sum is what Mr. El-Masri says took place.

<<2221.66;2224.94;en>>
Why should this Court believe him?

<<2224.94;2237.48;en>>
First, because this detailed complaint, prepared in 2006, closely tracks an initial statement that Mr. El-Masri gave to a lawyer two years before, within days of his return to Germany.

<<2237.48;2242.62;en>>
This was before anyone had heard of his case or had reported about it.

<<2242.62;2247.06;en>>
Since that time, Mr. El-Masri's description of events has remained remarkably consistent.

<<2247.06;2255.62;en>>
Indeed, one of the German prosecutors who brought criminal charges against CIA agents for what had happened underscored his credibility.

<<2255.62;2260.82;en>>
Thus, although Mr. El-Masri had been questioned for many hours, the prosecutor said, he always

<<2260.82;2263.16;en>>
has said the same things.

<<2263.16;2265.58;en>>
He never changed details.

<<2265.58;2270.9;en>>
I don't think it would be possible, he said, that someone could invent such a story.

<<2270.9;2275.08;en>>
But why else is Mr. El-Masri's account believable?

<<2275.08;2292.6;en>>
Because every subsequent investigation undertaken by national and European authorities and by his legal representatives, with the lone exception of Macedonia's insufficient attempt to cover up what happened, has unearthed evidence which corroborates his account in numerous ways.

<<2292.6;2294.78;en>>
What is that corroborating evidence?

<<2294.78;2308.2;en>>
First, there are documents from Eurocontrol, as well as additional flight data obtained through Freedom of Information requests and from the Macedonian Civil Aviation Authority and Skopje Airport.

<<2308.2;2324.92;en>>
This evidence confirms the landing, departure, and final destination of a plane known to be operating as a CIA rendition aircraft on the same day as, and fully consistent with, Mr. El-Masri's own account.

<<2324.92;2330.1;en>>
Just as Mr. El-Masri said, the records show that the CIA plane departed Skopje in the

<<2330.1;2338.38;en>>
early morning of 24 January 2004, and that it made one stop in Baghdad before heading on to Kabul.

<<2338.38;2349.3;en>>
The data also confirm that Macedonian authorities knew of the plane's Afghanistan destination 47 hours before it left Skopje.

<<2349.3;2367.1;en>>
Incredibly, the government now concedes that the public prosecutor took no steps to establish the purpose of the aircraft landing at Skopje Airport, even though all of this flight information came from the government's own records within its exclusive control.

<<2367.1;2380.66;en>>
Although the data show that the plane arrived in Skopje with no passenger and left Skopje with one passenger, the government apparently never sought to find out who that passenger was.

<<2380.66;2389.74;en>>
Finally, the flight data provide clear evidence of Macedonian government collusion in covering up the rendition operation.

<<2389.74;2404.1;en>>
The rendition flight was disguised in filings with international air traffic operators and in the Macedonian landing permit as a private, non-commercial flight, a characterization the authorities must have known to be false.

<<2404.1;2411.82;en>>
In short, the flight data coming from the government's own files provide powerful corroboration of Mr. El-Masri's account.

<<2411.82;2432.34;en>>
To see why, think of what an extraordinary coincidence it would be for a CIA plane to land in Skopje and take off for Kabul, hardly a frequent flyer destination, on precisely the date, as Mr. El-Masri says, that he was transferred by Macedonia to U.S. custody and

<<2432.34;2436.0;en>>
then taken on a CIA plane on that very route.

<<2436.0;2440.78;en>>
Is it really possible, as the government would have you believe, that Mr. El-Masri was not

<<2440.78;2442.72;en>>
on that plane?

<<2442.72;2445.94;en>>
This is more than coincidence, we submit.

<<2445.94;2448.58;en>>
It is fact.

<<2448.58;2464.82;en>>
Second, in addition to the flight data and the documentation, there is the expert statement by Gavin Simpson, who worked as an investigator, most notably as the advisor for Senator Dick Marti in the course of his inquiry for the PACE between 2005 and 2007.

<<2464.82;2471.5;en>>
He has spoken with numerous sources in both Macedonia and the United States who have direct knowledge of what happened in this operation.

<<2471.5;2476.7;en>>
And he found, just as the other investigations have, that Mr. El-Masri's detention by the

<<2476.7;2485.38;en>>
UBK, Macedonia's intelligence agency, was a coordinated operation undertaken at the request of the CIA.

<<2485.38;2490.62;en>>
Simpson also discovered that on the day that the CIA plane took Mr. El-Masri to Afghanistan,

<<2490.62;2505.58;en>>
the Macedonian authorities undertook extraordinary security measures, deploying a heavily armed detail of the security police who guarded the aircraft on the runway under strict instruction to keep their backs turned toward the plane.

<<2505.58;2510.7;en>>
So Mr. El-Masri's account is corroborated by the flight data, by the investigation that

<<2510.7;2520.3;en>>
we have submitted, and by the conclusions of the many official inquiries, but there is more.

<<2520.3;2530.46;en>>
This Court has before it the sworn statement of a former senior official of the government of Macedonia, who at the time of Mr. El-Masri's detention personally authorized the involvement

<<2530.46;2534.66;en>>
of the Macedonian intelligence agency, the UBK, in these events.

<<2534.66;2539.98;en>>
The statement directly contradicts the government's claim that Mr. El-Masri was held for only

<<2539.98;2543.26;en>>
five hours and then released.

<<2543.26;2548.38;en>>
Our UBK liaisons told their United States intelligence partners about Mr. El-Masri's

<<2548.38;2554.02;en>>
arrival and were told that this man was suspected of involvement in Islamic terrorism.

<<2554.02;2558.78;en>>
Acting in compliance with the U.S. request, the Macedonian government agreed to hold Mr.

<<2558.78;2564.5;en>>
El-Masri until he could be handed over to the U.S. authorities for further interrogation.

<<2564.5;2569.56;en>>
Mr. El-Masri was held for a certain period in a location in Skopje, secretly and without

<<2569.56;2573.98;en>>
incident under the constant supervision of UBK agents.

<<2573.98;2579.66;en>>
Our U.S. counterparts indicated they would send an aircraft and a team of CIA agents

<<2579.66;2584.66;en>>
to Macedonia to take custody of Mr. El-Masri and fly him out of the country.

<<2584.66;2591.1;en>>
As time passed, I indicated to our U.S. counterparts that Macedonia would have to release Mr. El-Masri

<<2591.1;2594.14;en>>
if this rendition could not take place quickly.

<<2594.14;2600.66;en>>
Ultimately, sometime on 23 January, Mr. El-Masri was handed over to the custody of a CIA rendition

<<2600.66;2608.74;en>>
team at the Skopje airport and was flown out of Macedonia on a CIA-operated aircraft."

<<2608.74;2617.66;en>>
In short, the statement provides conclusive confirmation by the person who actually authorized the operation that Mr. El-Masri's account is correct.

<<2617.66;2620.42;en>>
What other corroboration is before the Court?

<<2620.42;2636.7;en>>
In December of 2005, immediately after meeting with then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters that Rice admitted that the United States had made a mistake in abducting and detaining Mr. El-Masri in Afghanistan.

<<2636.7;2642.3;en>>
And Mr. El-Masri's description of his transfer to the CIA and rendition bears striking similarities

<<2642.3;2647.9;en>>
to what has since been disclosed about approved CIA procedures in other cases.

<<2647.9;2654.02;en>>
A CIA memo released in late 2004, after Mr. El-Masri first described what had happened

<<2654.02;2658.66;en>>
to him, makes clear that the method by which he was brought into U.S. custody at Skopje

<<2658.66;2669.6;en>>
airport was carefully designed to give rise to a state of what is called capture shock, with the goal of inducing learned helplessness and dependence.

<<2669.6;2674.06;en>>
The memo details many of the methods used against Mr. El-Masri, including shackling

<<2674.06;2679.18;en>>
during the flight and blindfolds, earmuffs and hoods.

<<2679.18;2689.8;en>>
Finally numerous reports in reputable international media have quoted unnamed Macedonian officials as admitting Macedonia's deliberate involvement in Mr. El-Masri's detention and rendition

<<2689.8;2694.06;en>>
as a favor to the United States.

<<2694.06;2705.58;en>>
In sum, the evidence of Macedonia's active complicity and involvement in the unlawful detention, disappearance and abuse of Mr. El-Masri is, we submit, overwhelming.

<<2705.58;2714.5;en>>
Now we will turn to the questions of first, why this case is properly before the Court, and secondly, the convention violations for which Macedonia is responsible.

<<2714.5;2716.9;en>>
And my colleague Mr. Pavley will address those issues.

<<2716.9;2716.9;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Nicolas Bratza]]

<<2720.41;2721.69;en>>
Thank you, Mr. Goldson.

<<2721.69;2722.69;en>>
Then Mr. Pavli, please.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<2724.71;2726.81;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<2726.81;2735.31;en>>
I will turn first to questions of admissibility, arguing in particular why this application was brought to Strasbourg in a timely fashion.

<<2735.31;2740.55;en>>
I will then summarize the applicant's submissions on the merits.

<<2740.55;2751.79;en>>
I'll not spend too much time on exhaustion of domestic remedies because the government does not seem to dispute that remedies were exhausted.

<<2751.79;2755.53;en>>
I'll turn then to the six-month rule.

<<2755.53;2770.75;en>>
In cases like this one, involving an ongoing duty to investigate, the six-month clock starts from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of circumstances that rendered the remedy ineffective.

<<2770.75;2782.19;en>>
In this case, the date was 24th of January 2009, the date when prosecutions for the offenses committed against Mr. El-Masri were statutorily barred in Macedonia.

<<2782.19;2788.93;en>>
On the 20th of July 2009, less than six months later, Mr. El-Masri filed an introductory letter

<<2788.93;2790.59;en>>
with the court.

<<2790.59;2810.47;en>>
Misconstruing this court's well-settled jurisprudence and misrepresenting the facts, the government suggests that the current application came to Strasbourg too late because, they say, the applicant ought to have known earlier that no effective investigation of his claims was likely or possible in Macedonia.

<<2810.47;2817.59;en>>
The government spent virtually their entire time of opening statement trying to make this argument.

<<2817.59;2822.37;en>>
And yet, the claim is spurious and unsupported by the case law.

<<2822.37;2829.17;en>>
In addressing timeliness, this court has identified a number of factors, of which three are most relevant here.

<<2829.17;2837.47;en>>
The complexity of the crimes at issue, the applicant's diligence, and the adequacy of the domestic investigation.

<<2837.47;2840.15;en>>
All three factors make clear that Mr. El-Masri

<<2840.15;2844.55;en>>
filed his application in a timely fashion.

<<2844.55;2856.35;en>>
The government just now claimed that there was no specific circumstances as a matter of the six-time limit law that would justify his actions.

<<2856.35;2861.75;en>>
And yet, that is a most peculiar claim to make under the circumstances of this case.

<<2861.75;2873.39;en>>
Complex crimes committed by state agents under the cloak of complete secrecy, disguise, and monolithic state protection, as in this case, often take many years to unravel.

<<2873.39;2884.59;en>>
This is all the more so, whereas here, the crimes were perpetrated as part of a multi-state conspiracy, which government actors have gone to great effort to cover up.

<<2884.59;2896.43;en>>
In one leading case, Varnava, to bring just one example, this court assumed jurisdiction over events going back some 15 years from the date of the filing of the application.

<<2896.43;2908.21;en>>
Adopting the position of the government, as argued here, would effectively guarantee impunity for all sorts of international crimes and gross human rights violations.

<<2908.21;2913.87;en>>
Turning to diligence, the government accuses Mr. El-Masri of remaining totally passive

<<2913.87;2916.13;en>>
and displaying no initiative.

<<2916.13;2921.83;en>>
But from the moment of his release to the present, Mr. El-Masri has done everything possible

<<2921.83;2924.15;en>>
to secure a legal redress.

<<2924.15;2937.55;en>>
Within days of returning to his hometown in Germany, he contacted a local lawyer and set in motion a criminal investigation by the German authorities with which he actively collaborated for several years.

<<2937.55;2944.15;en>>
The government claims that the applicant was doing nothing in 2005 or 2006 or 2007.

<<2944.15;2956.87;en>>
But in December 2005, his lawyers filed a case in the US federal court against the government of the United States, the country which he indeed considered principally responsible for his ordeal.

<<2956.87;2962.27;en>>
He spoke to countless reporters and others who cared to hear about his story.

<<2962.27;2974.59;en>>
And starting in January 2006, he began a multi-year collaboration with two European inquiries, the Fava and Mardi inquiries, that featured his case prominently in their successive report.

<<2974.59;2982.07;en>>
The government argues that these are not meant to exhaust domestic remedies.

<<2982.07;2985.95;en>>
And yet, under the case law, that is not a relevant point.

<<2985.95;2995.45;en>>
Under the case law, the applicant was entitled to expect and await the outcome of this series of international inquiries that could help his case.

<<2995.45;3000.35;en>>
From late 2007 to 2010, Mr. El-Masri and his legal team

<<3000.35;3013.17;en>>
filed freedom of information requests with Macedonian authorities, approached high-level witnesses in the country, and hired a specialized investigator, Mr. Simpson, to conduct two separate investigative trips

<<3013.17;3016.83;en>>
to Skopje and produce an extensive report.

<<3016.83;3025.55;en>>
These efforts produced real, novel evidence from local sources that has significantly strengthened the applicant's case.

<<3025.55;3028.19;en>>
As Mr. Simpson's report, the statement

<<3028.19;3033.43;en>>
of the former senior Macedonian official, and the freedom of information responses show.

<<3033.43;3039.55;en>>
So there was indeed a lot more than a single freedom of information request filed.

<<3039.55;3051.35;en>>
Finally, unlike in the Byram case, there was here in this case no ex-officio investigation underway in Macedonia with which the applicant could have collaborated prior to October 2008.

<<3051.35;3064.89;en>>
When finally the authorities did pursue a cursory inquiry in Macedonia in response to his criminal complaint, they terminated it within two months and hid that fact incredibly for almost two years.

<<3064.89;3073.27;en>>
To sum up, the applicant acted in full compliance with the six-month rule and its interpretation in the Byram and Varnava line of cases.

<<3073.27;3096.75;en>>
It was only in hindsight, with the benefit of what we know since late January 2009, and specifically in view of the way Macedonian prosecutors led the state of limitation lapse without any real investigation and without even bothering to inform the applicant that it became clear to the applicant that there was not going to be an effective local investigation.

<<3096.75;3100.79;en>>
We shall address the questions under the merits to which I turn now.

<<3100.79;3103.87;en>>
Macedonia has violated Mr. Elmasy's rights

<<3103.87;3108.83;en>>
under Articles 3, 5, 8, 10, and 13 of the Convention.

<<3108.83;3112.15;en>>
Our written submissions address these claims comprehensively.

<<3112.15;3117.27;en>>
So here I'd focus on the violations of Article 3 and 5.

<<3117.27;3135.07;en>>
Under Article 3, Macedonia is fully and directly responsible for the Article 3 violations that occurred from his detention at the Tabanovce border crossing to the moment the CIA rendition plane took off from Skopje Airport in the early hours of 24 January 2004.

<<3135.07;3148.87;en>>
In addition, the respondent is liable under the Tsuring doctrine for exposing the applicant to a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3, which treatment, in fact, materialized under US custody.

<<3148.87;3157.45;en>>
At the Skopje Merak, held extrajudicially by Macedonian intelligence agents, Mr. Elmasy suffered prolonged anguish and stress

<<3157.45;3163.11;en>>
over his fate, forcing him to go on his first of three hunger strikes.

<<3163.11;3175.35;en>>
When he tried to leave, his captors put a gun to his head and threatened to shoot him on one occasion and pressured him repeatedly to admit links, false links, to various terrorist groups.

<<3175.35;3179.23;en>>
He was held incommunicado throughout this time.

<<3179.23;3187.31;en>>
That such a thing could happen in a European capital in 2004 is almost beyond belief.

<<3187.31;3192.95;en>>
Such treatment amounted to torture under Article 3 case law, cumulatively.

<<3192.95;3202.85;en>>
At Skopje Airport, he suffered at the ends of the CIA rendition team what was, by his own admission, the most vicious and humiliating mistreatment of the entire period.

<<3202.85;3208.59;en>>
This was the textbook capture shock treatment described clinically in CIA memos.

<<3208.59;3223.99;en>>
He was violently assaulted, stripped naked, forcefully tranquilized and sodomized, and subjected to total sensory deprivation and pay for street positions, all calculated to induce a state of learned helplessness and dependence.

<<3223.99;3230.43;en>>
While shackled hand and foot and with a bag over his head, he was dragged across the tarmac at the airport.

<<3230.43;3236.11;en>>
The violence was totally out of proportion to any threat he could have possibly posed.

<<3236.11;3252.75;en>>
The United Nations Committee Against Torture and the UN Human Rights Committee, in two similar cases against Sweden, Agiza and Algeria, found that capture shock treatment amounted to torture and a breach of Article 7 of the ICCPR.

<<3252.75;3258.15;en>>
Macedonian agents present at Skopje Airport violated the convention in two ways.

<<3258.15;3266.19;en>>
First, they failed to intervene to prevent ill treatment by non-state actors on Macedonian territory.

<<3266.19;3273.99;en>>
Secondly, by providing protection and concealment for the CIA plane, they facilitated such treatment contrary to Article 3.

<<3278.59;3297.43;en>>
Under the Tsering doctrine, the respondent is in addition responsible for exposing the applicant to a risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 upon a secret transfer to US custody in Afghanistan, even though substantial grounds existed at the relevant time for believing that such a risk was real.

<<3297.43;3317.59;en>>
The transfer was conducted in complete secrecy and deceit of the applicant and without any judicial scrutiny whatsoever, let alone the rigorous independent scrutiny of the risk required by the case law in view of the absolute character of the torture prohibition under the convention.

<<3317.59;3321.27;en>>
Mr. Elmasy himself was never told what fate awaited him

<<3321.27;3326.79;en>>
once on the rendition flight, and he was never given an opportunity to challenge the transfer.

<<3326.79;3332.87;en>>
He was treated as just a piece of human cargo with no rights.

<<3332.87;3356.67;en>>
This was a clear case of the so-called extraordinary rendition, defined by this court as the extrajudicial transfer of persons from one jurisdiction or state to another for the purposes of detention and interrogation outside the normal legal system where there is a real risk of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.

<<3356.67;3360.61;en>>
Can such a practice ever be consistent with Article 3?

<<3360.61;3366.87;en>>
This court recently answered that question in the following terms in the Babar Ahmad admissibility decision.

<<3366.87;3375.55;en>>
Extraordinary rendition by its deliberate circumvention of due process is anathema to the rule of law and the values protected by the convention.

<<3375.55;3390.35;en>>
It would be incompatible with the contracting state's obligation under the convention if it were to extradite or otherwise remove an individual from its territory in circumstances where that individual was at real risk of extraordinary rendition.

<<3390.35;3396.05;en>>
To do so would be to collude in the violation of the most basic rights guaranteed by the convention."

<<3396.05;3397.51;en>>
End quote.

<<3397.51;3403.01;en>>
Extraordinary rendition is now a euphemism for outsourcing torture.

<<3403.01;3408.87;en>>
There is no doubt on this record that the respondent knew and should have known that it was exposing Mr. Elmasri

<<3408.87;3411.91;en>>
to the risk of extraordinary rendition.

<<3411.91;3422.21;en>>
Aviation records show that the Macedonian authorities knew at least 47 hours ahead of the takeoff of that plane that it was heading from Skopje to Kabul, Afghanistan.

<<3422.21;3428.23;en>>
They even double-checked the destination while the plane waited on the runway for several hours.

<<3428.23;3443.95;en>>
Furthermore, it was common knowledge in early 2004 that significant detainee abuse in US custody had taken place since the end of 2001 in Afghanistan, in Guantanamo, and other places of secret or extraterritorial US detention.

<<3443.95;3467.55;en>>
There were multiple fact-finding reports and statements of concern from reputable media, but also the Red Cross and at least four separate United Nations bodies listed in our submissions detailing various forms of prescribed treatment, including abusive interrogation techniques, poor detention conditions, prolonged and communicado detention, and denial of basic habeas rights.

<<3467.55;3476.59;en>>
There is no indication that any diplomatic or other assurances were sought and obtained by Macedonia to mitigate the risk to Mr. Elmasri.

<<3476.59;3483.63;en>>
Instead, this was nothing short of collusion in the violation of the most basic rights of the applicant.

<<3483.63;3486.19;en>>
Under Article V, Mr. Elmasri was the victim

<<3486.19;3495.55;en>>
of a joint US-Macedonian secret intelligence operation, resulting in his continued disappearance for a period of 149 days.

<<3495.55;3504.63;en>>
He was disappeared for the sole purpose of interrogation in a location and under circumstances that placed him in a virtual legal black hole.

<<3504.63;3513.27;en>>
Under this court's law, disappearances are a most grave violation of Article V and a complete negation of its procedural guarantees.

<<3513.27;3520.87;en>>
The applicant's secret detention in both Macedonia and Afghanistan violated every single Article V guarantee.

<<3520.87;3526.63;en>>
It was not carried out in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law, and it was not lawful.

<<3526.63;3529.57;en>>
Mr. Elmasri was never informed of the proper reasons

<<3529.57;3533.83;en>>
for his detention and never brought before a judge of any country.

<<3533.83;3540.33;en>>
He was never given an opportunity to challenge his detention, as he was held entirely incommunicado.

<<3540.33;3548.67;en>>
He was not once during this entire period allowed to contact his family, a lawyer, or a German consular official.

<<3548.67;3556.87;en>>
Macedonia acted in collusion with US intelligence in disappearing the applicant in one continuous and joint operation.

<<3556.87;3562.59;en>>
It is thus directly responsible for violations of Mr. Elmasri's Article V rights

<<3562.59;3570.15;en>>
for the entire period of his secret detention at Skopje airport and in Afghanistan.

<<3570.15;3582.87;en>>
The rendition simply would not have happened had the respondent government chosen to refuse the US request to illegally detain and then hand over the applicant.

<<3582.87;3594.35;en>>
The respondent had a separate duty under Article III to conduct a prompt, effective, and thorough criminal investigation into the applicant's arguable claims of Article III violations.

<<3594.35;3600.23;en>>
And a similar duty arises with respect to severe violations of Article V.

<<3600.23;3605.59;en>>
The Macedonia authorities have failed dismally in their duty to investigate.

<<3605.59;3611.59;en>>
They declined to initiate an ex officio investigation, even as Mr. Elmasri's claim received

<<3611.59;3621.11;en>>
major international publicity, and even after the Munich prosecutor twice provided information evidencing criminal activity in Macedonia.

<<3621.11;3627.51;en>>
And they failed to do so after the applicant filed a formal criminal complaint with the Skopje prosecutor.

<<3627.51;3631.95;en>>
The list of investigative failures is too long to describe here.

<<3631.95;3634.47;en>>
There is a full analysis in our submissions.

<<3634.47;3636.83;en>>
But the most blatant ones are the following.

<<3636.83;3639.31;en>>
The investigation was not independent.

<<3639.31;3656.73;en>>
Throughout these years, the Macedonian prosecutors have relied exclusively on versions of events provided by the Macedonian Ministry of Interior, the same institution that oversees the Macedonian intelligence service, the UBEKA, that Mr. Elmasri had identified as responsible

<<3656.73;3658.63;en>>
for his disappearance.

<<3658.63;3678.87;en>>
This, even though this court had held as early as October 2006 in at least two cases against Macedonia, Jasar and Jeladinov, that internal departments of the Ministry of Interior, quote, lacked the necessary independence to carry out investigations into abuses by ministry personnel.

<<3678.87;3683.75;en>>
The investigation also not thorough, effective, or professional.

<<3683.75;3694.43;en>>
The national prosecutors continue to blindly follow the version of events of the Ministry of Interior, even as its credibility was thoroughly undermined over the years.

<<3694.43;3702.87;en>>
To highlight just one example, the prosecutors never tried to find the real purpose of the N313P flight.

<<3702.87;3705.63;en>>
The treatment of Mr. Elmasri by the Macedonian authorities

<<3705.63;3730.13;en>>
under this heading is as lacking in humanity as the Russian military court's treatment of the Katyn massacre relatives in the recent Janowiec case, where the court found that the callous disregard for the applicant's concerns and deliberate obfuscation of the circumstances of the massacre amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment of the victim's Polish relatives.

<<3730.13;3741.05;en>>
In this case, similar treatment was reserved for the victim himself, constituting a separate count of inhuman and degrading treatment under Article 3.

<<3741.05;3745.99;en>>
Finally, I'm almost done, Mr. President.

<<3745.99;3751.19;en>>
Finally, Macedonia is responsible for violating Mr. Elmasri's right to respect for his private and family

<<3751.19;3755.39;en>>
life under Article 8, his right to a remedy under Article 13.

<<3755.39;3767.63;en>>
And by its deliberate obfuscation of what was done to him for eight long years, it has also violated his right to truth and also the general public's right to truth under the convention.

<<3767.63;3778.83;en>>
Honorable judges, not too long ago, on Macedonia's side of the Iron Curtain, people were being routinely disappeared of the face of the earth, never to be seen again.

<<3778.83;3789.01;en>>
By joining the Council of Europe and becoming a party to this convention, Macedonia made, in effect, a promise of never again allowing such things to happen with impunity.

<<3789.01;3796.91;en>>
For five months between January and May 2008, and then eight years of denial and injustice, that promise was badly broken.

<<3796.91;3805.99;en>>
The Macedonian government let down Khaled Elmasri, an innocent person who had sought refuge in this continent from a brutal civil war at home.

<<3805.99;3824.47;en>>
At the same time, the government betrayed its commitment to that communal, profound belief, to which the preamble to the convention refers, in fundamental freedoms, which are the foundation of justice and peace in the world, even in a world having to deal with the scourge of international terrorism.

<<3824.47;3830.95;en>>
This court represents the best and perhaps last hope for restoring some of that faith to Mr. Elmasri

<<3830.95;3833.51;en>>
and the European citizens at large.

<<3833.51;3833.51;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Nicolas Bratza]]

<<3836.19;3838.75;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Pavley.

<<3838.75;3853.15;en>>
We have then, therefore, come to an end of the first round of submissions, and I would like to ask at this stage the judges whether they wish to put any questions to the parties.

<<3853.15;3854.15;en>>
Judge Lorenzen, please.

[[Judge;Peer Lorenzen]]

<<3856.71;3861.75;en>>
Thank you very much. I have just one question to the applicant.

<<3861.75;3864.75;en>>
My question is the following.

<<3864.75;3877.35;en>>
Did the applicant, immediately after his return to Germany in late May, I think it was the 29th of May 2004, undergo a medical examination?

<<3877.35;3883.35;en>>
If not, and I don't think we have information that it happened, what were the reasons for not doing so?

[[JudgeP;Nicolas Bratza]]

<<3886.12;3888.96;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge Power-Forde.

[[Judge;Ann Power-Forde]]

<<3890.74;3891.26;en>>
Thank you.

<<3891.26;3903.82;en>>
Following on Judge Lorenzen's question, this question is also addressed to the applicant in terms of the high standard of proof that's required before a violation of Article 3 can be found.

<<3903.82;3910.3;en>>
And my question concerns exclusively the allegations of physical ill treatment, assault, sodomy.

<<3910.3;3914.94;en>>
It's not related to the global complaints that are made in relation to Article 3.

<<3914.94;3929.7;en>>
And having regard to the evidence that's there, the forensic and the medical evidence that's available, I would like to hear the applicant on whether that standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt has been met, purely in relation to the allegations of physical ill treatment.

<<3929.7;3942.54;en>>
And I would also like to have the applicant's submissions, if any, on whether the circumstances of this case would require that the onus shift to the respondent state on the basis of the legal principle laid down in Tomasi.

<<3942.54;3945.44;en>>
And if it should revert, then why?

<<3945.44;3949.74;en>>
And of course, the state is invited, if necessary, to comment on the second limb of that question.

<<3949.74;3950.5;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Nicolas Bratza]]

<<3952.3;3954.14;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<3954.14;3955.98;en>>
Any further questions?

<<3955.98;3957.66;en>>
Yes, please, Judge Vajić.

[[Judge;Nina Vajić]]

<<3966.97;3969.37;en>>
Thank you very much, President.

<<3969.37;3972.57;en>>
I have a question for the applicant.

<<3972.57;3973.73;en>>
I'm sorry.

<<3973.73;3995.67;en>>
And in fact, in view of the arguments given in the written submissions on page 47 in reply to question 10 put by the court, could you please elaborate on the reasons for which the applicant did not submit the witness statement to the national prosecution authorities?

<<3995.67;3999.41;en>>
And in particular, on two points that you raised there.

<<3999.41;4014.13;en>>
First, why do you state that that statement, the witness statement, does not contain any new facts which should first have been presented to the national authorities?

<<4014.13;4036.01;en>>
And second, to elaborate on the argument that this statement was given on condition to be used only before this court, in the applicant's view in such circumstances, would it be possible for the court to use this statement?

<<4036.01;4036.01;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Nicolas Bratza]]

<<4042.28;4043.88;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4043.88;4048.16;en>>
Are there any further questions?

<<4048.16;4049.88;en>>
It doesn't seem to be the case.

<<4049.88;4056.24;en>>
Then I propose to adjourn the hearing for 20 minutes.

<<4056.24;4064.12;en>>
And we will then return to have replies to the questions and any additional observations the parties may wish to make.

<<4064.12;4064.12;en>>
Hearing is adjourned.

[[Announcer;UNK]]

<<4191.51;4192.27;fr>>
La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Nicolas Bratza]]

<<4240.85;4246.77;en>>
Please be seated.

<<4246.77;4250.13;en>>
So I give the floor then to Mr. Bogdanov again.

<<4250.13;4250.13;en>>
Mr. Bogdanov, please.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<4254.0;4256.6;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4256.6;4261.44;en>>
Well, I'll be very brief in my response.

<<4261.44;4271.48;en>>
At the outset, I would like to reiterate the government has demonstrated to this court that the case is inadmissible.

<<4271.48;4282.24;en>>
And on the contrary, the applicant has not presented a single argument in front of this court that he satisfied the admissibility criteria.

<<4282.24;4289.24;en>>
There are only two issues which were raised by the applicant's representatives in their speech to which the government shall respond.

<<4289.24;4300.52;en>>
The first one is the purported lack of evidence that the applicant left the country through the Bladze border in Macedonia.

<<4300.52;4311.48;en>>
The government would like to note that, contrary to the applicant's submissions, this fact is corroborated by material evidence which is submitted to this court.

<<4311.48;4315.86;en>>
And attached to the files of the court.

<<4315.86;4329.86;en>>
Secondly, I would like also briefly to reply regarding the recent Polish judgment which was seated by the applicants in their submissions and regarding the substantive limb of Article 3.

<<4332.7;4348.74;en>>
The government recalls that Article 3 has previously been relied on a number of cases before the court in which the applicants complained that they had suffered inhuman undergrading treatment on the part of the domestic authorities in the context of the death or disappearance of their next of kin.

<<4348.74;4357.96;en>>
The claims found their basis on the state of uncertainty the relatives have had to endure owing to their inability to find out the fate of their next of kin.

<<4357.96;4377.62;en>>
According to the already well-established case law, the manner in which the applicants' inquiries are responded by the authorities should be prerequisite in finding flagrant, continuous, and callous disregard for the applicants' concerns and anxieties amounting to inhuman treatment within the meaning of Article 3.

<<4377.62;4384.54;en>>
The diligence on the part of the applicant towards the investigation again remains essential.

<<4384.54;4405.12;en>>
Consequently, when there is no active stance by the applicant towards the investigation and the authorities, and no requests or inquiries whatsoever are made by him, he may not claim the local standing in this respect, since there won't be any authorities responses that the court may examine from the standpoint of Article 3.

<<4405.12;4406.68;en>>
That's all that I have.

<<4406.68;4406.7;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4406.7;4406.74;en>>
Thank you, Court.

<<4406.74;4407.18;en>>
Thank you.

<<4407.2;4407.2;en>>
Thank you.

<<4407.2;4407.2;en>>
Thank you.

<<4407.2;4407.2;en>>
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

<<4407.2;4407.2;en>>
Thank you.

<<4407.2;4407.2;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4407.2;4407.2;en>>
Thank you guys for being with us today.

<<4407.2;4407.2;en>>
Thank you for being our audience for us tonight.

<<4407.2;4407.2;en>>
Thank you very much for being with us.

<<4407.2;4407.2;en>>
Thank you.

<<4407.2;4407.2;en>>
Go, go, go.

<<4407.2;4407.2;en>>
for it.

[[JudgeP;Nicolas Bratza]]

<<4410.42;4411.74;en>>
Thank you, Mr Bogdanov.

<<4411.74;4415.26;en>>
Can I put one question to you?

<<4415.26;4422.78;en>>
In your submissions in the first round, you addressed simply the question of admissibility.

<<4422.78;4429.58;en>>
Do I take it that so far as the merits are concerned, you stand by your written pleadings?

<<4429.58;4429.58;en>>
Is that right?

[[Government;GR1]]

<<4430.34;4440.66;en>>
Yes, regarding the merits, we, our position is already submitted with the written observations, so there are no changes and we would like to reaffirm it at this point.

[[JudgeP;Nicolas Bratza]]

<<4441.35;4442.79;en>>
Thank you very much. Mr Goldson, please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<4447.34;4450.76;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4450.76;4464.64;en>>
With the court's permission, I would address the questions from Judges Powerford and Lawrenson and a couple of questions related to admissibility that the government has raised.

<<4464.64;4468.76;en>>
And then Mr. Pavley will take the question by Judge Viach

<<4468.76;4473.04;en>>
and some further matters that have been raised by the government.

<<4473.04;4536.48;en>>
With respect just to the admissibility questions, one just on the point that was just raised earlier about the purported delay and negligence of the applicant in bringing a formal complaint to the Macedonian authorities and the suggestion that the applicant was doing nothing in the interim, we would submit that in a case of this complexity, crimes of this nature in which more than one state is involved, and particularly given that the nature of the crimes themselves is secret and governments have gone to a great length to maintain their secrecy as to what happened and to deny and to stonewall the revelation of facts, in that context, four and a half years, we would submit, is not a long period of time for the applicant to assemble the necessary facts to provide to criminal investigation authorities in Macedonia.

<<4536.48;4547.76;en>>
And I should note that throughout this time, the applicant was himself and through his legal representatives working diligently to pursue investigations.

<<4547.76;4565.76;en>>
He was in touch with the Munich prosecutor, who made two requests of the Macedonian authorities before 2008, and to which the Court has the very summary and, in our view, inadequate responses the Macedonian authorities gave.

<<4565.76;4579.92;en>>
He was the applicant was assisting the various European investigations by the Council of Europe, the Dick Morty investigation, and the Fava investigation of the European Parliament, as well as the German Bundestag investigation.

<<4579.92;4589.28;en>>
And these were all gradually yielding additional corroborating evidence, which he was ultimately able to bring to bear before the Macedonian authorities.

<<4589.28;4608.16;en>>
In addition, I should note that in the middle of 2008, shortly before he filed a formal criminal complaint with the Macedonian authorities, he received from Macedonia a response to a freedom of information request that had been filed.

<<4608.16;4619.24;en>>
And at that time, in June of 2008, for the first time, the Macedonian government confirmed as genuine the flight data, which the Morty report had earlier published.

<<4619.24;4635.92;en>>
So the flight data was known, but this represented in the response to the freedom of information request in mid-2008, shortly before he filed the criminal complaint, this response represented the first formal acknowledgment by the government that those data were genuine and could be relied upon.

<<4635.92;4654.76;en>>
And secondly, to our knowledge, at that time, that is in June of 2008, the response to FOIA, the freedom of information requests, the government for the first time disclosed that the plane at issue, the CIA rendition plane, arrived in Skopje with no passengers and departed Skopje with one passenger.

<<4654.76;4661.2;en>>
I believe that that was the first time that that was made clear by the Macedonian government's information.

<<4661.2;4665.2;en>>
So information was accumulating throughout this 4 1⁄2 years.

<<4665.2;4669.48;en>>
In addition, in June of 2008, the applicant learned something which was quite material.

<<4669.48;4678.08;en>>
And on the basis of all of that, he then proceeded to file a criminal complaint because he felt that he could satisfy the burden under Macedonian law for doing so.

<<4678.08;4686.56;en>>
I should note as well in this respect, the question was raised, I think, by the government of why the applicant went first to the United States before going to Macedonia.

<<4686.56;4702.52;en>>
And there, I think one very clearly reasonable explanation for that is that when he went to the United States, he filed a civil application, an application or a complaint for civil remedies in the district court in the United States.

<<4702.52;4707.76;en>>
And the burden of proof in civil proceedings in the United States is not what it is for criminal proceedings, of course.

<<4707.76;4715.0;en>>
And so he was able, he felt, to meet the threshold, even though ultimately the courts in the United States were not willing to hear his claims on the merits.

<<4715.0;4729.04;en>>
The applicant felt that he would be able to satisfy the threshold of proof of balance of the probabilities in evidence or preponderance of the evidence rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt as would be necessary in a criminal proceeding.

<<4729.04;4736.76;en>>
And it took more time to assemble the evidence that would be necessary to surmount a reasonable doubt barrier in a criminal proceeding.

<<4736.76;4749.88;en>>
So that, I think, gives some explanation of why a civil proceeding in the United States proceeded first, and after some time and additional evidence was assembled, he filed a complaint in Macedonia in the fall of 2008 in criminal proceedings.

<<4749.88;4764.52;en>>
And just on that, we, in making those representations, we in no way suggest that the government of Macedonia did not we in no way suggest that the government of Macedonia needed to wait for him to file his criminal complaint.

<<4764.52;4771.4;en>>
The government had an independent obligation from the very start when these facts and allegations emerged to do its own investigation.

<<4771.4;4775.64;en>>
It simply did not do so, as my colleague Mr. Pavley has responded.

<<4775.64;4779.32;en>>
But I do think in the context of this case, 4 and a half years is not long.

<<4779.32;4786.76;en>>
And I think the applicant did his very, very best to prove his case and bring it to the Macedonian authorities in a timely fashion.

<<4786.76;4805.96;en>>
If I can just say, then, with respect to the questions that were raised about the medical exam and the threshold of burden of proof specifically on the questions of physical treatment and assault under Article III, in fact, shortly after his return to Germany, the applicant did prove his case.

[[JudgeP;Nicolas Bratza]]

<<4804.08;4808.64;en>>
Mr. Goldson, could you speak a little bit less fast, please?

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<4808.19;4808.69;en>>
Of course.

<<4808.69;4809.41;en>>
Of course.

<<4809.41;4819.51;en>>
Shortly after his return to Germany, the applicant did undergo a medical examination, and that is in — that material is not in the court record.

<<4819.51;4826.07;en>>
It is in material that was submitted to the FAWA inquiry of the European Parliament by the German prosecutor.

<<4826.07;4833.23;en>>
We can certainly make it available to the Court if you'd wish, but it's not there because it's not very relevant in our view.

<<4833.23;4841.35;en>>
It concludes that there's no evidence, and one would not expect there would be, of physical injury as of that late date.

<<4841.35;4870.15;en>>
One must recall that the — according to what the applicant says, all the physical — almost all the physical assault that he encountered took place at the time that he was transferred from Macedonia to the CIA in January at Skopje Airport when he was subjected to the capture shock techniques, and shortly after his arrival in Kabul, Afghanistan, again in late January, early February.

<<4870.15;4903.27;en>>
So by the time of his release, it really would have been four months thereafter, and it would be surprising, indeed, if there were indicia of physical assault that still remained visible that late in time, particularly when one takes account of the fact that has been well documented in other proceedings, the kinds of treatment which he was subjected by the CIA both on Macedonian territory and once in Kabul were designed precisely, as has been made very clear in other proceedings, not to leave any evidence of physical mistreatment.

<<4903.27;4914.75;en>>
And there were sophisticated methods developed precisely to ensure that that was the case. And I think, you know, in terms of the questions of the burden of proof that

<<4914.75;4925.27;en>>
we would submit, that the Tamasi reversal of the burden does apply, because it is conceded by the government as well that he was in custody for some period of time.

<<4925.27;4940.07;en>>
We dispute for how long, but we would argue that, yes, once in custody, the burden of proof reverses, and the government is under an explanation to offer an explanation of his injuries, which it is unable to do. But we would also submit that even if the

<<4940.07;4964.13;en>>
government is under an explanation, that there was no reversal in this case, that the applicant is able to sustain his burden of proof as required by the Court's prior jurisprudence, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which the Court has interpreted to mean the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear, and concordant inferences or of a similar unrebutted presumption of fact. And we believe that the applicant

<<4964.13;4968.75;en>>
has more than sustained that burden in this case. Just very briefly, to recall,

<<4968.83;4983.11;en>>
you have his consistent and very detailed testimony of the kinds of physical abuse to which he was subjected, both at the airport in Skopje and upon shortly after arrival in Kabul. You have that repeated again and again in numerous

<<4983.11;4988.07;en>>
testimonies by him. You have the fact that his testimony has been corroborated

<<4988.07;5008.27;en>>
numerous times by others who have been the victims of similar techniques by the CIA and or cooperating governments in renditions to other countries, as has been disclosed in numerous other proceedings, as has been found by two United Nations treaty bodies, et cetera. You also have the isotopic hair analysis, which certainly

<<5008.27;5023.55;en>>
corroborates the fact that he was deprived of food for long periods of time, and we would submit is also additional corroboration for the abusive treatment which he underwent in Afghanistan to be force-fed. And frankly, every inquiry beyond

<<5023.55;5034.07;en>>
this one that has engaged and looked at this case has found that his allegations of physical abuse are true. That is, the Bundestag inquiry, the Fava inquiry of the

<<5034.07;5039.75;en>>
European Parliament, the Dick Markey inquiry. So we would submit that, yes, the burden

<<5039.75;5050.07;en>>
shifts, but that even if it doesn't, the applicant has sustained his burden in this case. And if I can just briefly, I apologize, Mr. President, but just briefly

<<5050.07;5060.51;en>>
respond to the question that was raised by the government just now about evidence regarding the applicant's departure from Macedonia for Kosovo. The Markey report,

<<5060.51;5093.11;en>>
which is in the record, found that, in fact, the — there was no record in the applicant's passport of a stamp having been given to indicate his departure, and that the head of the Ubeka answered the question, and that's the reason why I'm asking you to submit that the head of the Ubeka answered to the Markey inquiry at that time that normally there should be a stamp in this passport as you cross the border out of Macedonia, but I can't be sure. So we would submit, frankly, that this is yet another instance

<<5093.11;5102.47;en>>
in which the effort by the government to offer evidence in support of their version of events is simply without merit. With that, I will ask Mr. Pavley to respond

<<5102.47;5102.47;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Nicolas Bratza]]

<<5104.34;5106.24;en>>
Thank you, Mr Goldson. Mr Pavli, please.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<5106.99;5108.39;en>>
Thank you.

<<5108.39;5114.73;en>>
So I'd like to start by responding to the question posed by Judge Vajic.

<<5114.73;5125.09;en>>
And the question was, why did the applicant submit the statement by the former senior Macedonian official to the national prosecutor?

<<5125.09;5131.33;en>>
And the answer to that is that the statement was obtained on the 4th of March, 2010.

<<5131.33;5146.13;en>>
By that time, it was, and it is still, our belief that the statute of limitations had actually expired in Macedonia, and that rendered any remedies ineffective.

<<5146.13;5155.77;en>>
And the statute of limitations would have expired by January 24, 2009, so more than a year earlier.

<<5155.77;5158.01;en>>
And that is the reason why we did not submit it.

<<5158.01;5164.25;en>>
We did not believe it would be of any use in that context.

<<5164.25;5189.65;en>>
Secondly, I'd like to point out that whatever the re-characterization of the criminal offense by the Macedonian prosecutor may be, and whatever effects that might have on the lapsing of the statute of limitations, we dispute that there are any effects, and we dispute that re-characterization, because we do not see that it has any factual basis.

<<5189.65;5207.49;en>>
But whatever that decision was by the Macedonian prosecutor, we were simply not aware of it, because the Macedonian prosecutor simply failed to notify the applicant for almost two years of what the decision was and what the legal basis was.

<<5207.49;5219.21;en>>
So in short, by 4th of March, 2010, the date we obtained that statement by the former official, we believed that the statute of limitations had lapsed.

<<5219.21;5220.81;en>>
Could that statement be used?

<<5220.81;5226.13;en>>
I believe that was Judge Viage's second point.

<<5226.13;5237.17;en>>
Could that statement be used by this court, given that there is a condition placed in there by the author of the statement that it can only be used for the purpose of these proceedings?

<<5237.17;5247.89;en>>
We did not believe that that or anything else in the statement should represent an obstacle to the court's use of that piece of evidence as the court sees fit.

<<5247.89;5271.85;en>>
We believe that under the rules of the court and the jurisprudence of the court, the court has significant broad discretion to make whatever use it sees fit of the evidence that comes before it and the court obtains and draw any inferences from that evidence that the court estimates.

<<5271.85;5284.13;en>>
I'd like to address secondarily and shortly a couple of other points in response to points made by the government.

<<5284.13;5295.05;en>>
The government representative stated that there was no communication with the prosecutor after the filing of the criminal complaint.

<<5295.05;5297.25;en>>
That is not correct.

<<5297.25;5306.57;en>>
The applicant's Macedonian lawyer, my colleague, Mr. Medarsti, sitting here, made several inquiries

<<5306.57;5331.73;en>>
by telephone and spoke directly with the case prosecutor, the same person who had terminated the investigation both before the lapse of the statute of limitation and after the lapse of the statute of limitation and was repeatedly told, amazingly in hindsight, by the person who had terminated the investigation that there was nothing new.

<<5331.73;5334.53;en>>
There was no significant developments.

<<5334.53;5335.29;en>>
It was ongoing.

<<5335.29;5337.09;en>>
There was nothing new.

<<5337.09;5340.09;en>>
And that is remarkable.

<<5344.13;5358.81;en>>
We would like to point out that that refusal to notify the victim and his representative is not only, in fact, and contrary to what was said, a violation of Macedonian law and practice.

<<5358.81;5362.25;en>>
There is a duty to notify the applicant.

<<5362.25;5372.41;en>>
But it is most certainly a violation of the duty of the Macedonian state under this court's case law.

<<5372.41;5378.77;en>>
Under Article III, there's a duty to keep the applicant duly informed.

<<5378.77;5388.85;en>>
It is part of the humane treatment and the proper duty to investigate, to involve the applicant, and keep the applicant properly informed.

<<5388.85;5397.77;en>>
And the failure to inform the applicant was a dismal failure of that duty under Article III.

<<5397.77;5420.09;en>>
It was also argued by the government that the remedy chosen by the applicant was not effective because it would have been more effective if the criminal complaint was brought against identified persons rather than unidentified persons.

<<5420.09;5427.01;en>>
And of course, it might be plausible in theory, whenever possible, you should try to identify the perpetrators.

<<5427.01;5433.85;en>>
It might not be the easiest thing in the circumstances of this case when you're a victim of a top secret operation.

<<5433.85;5453.85;en>>
But beyond that, the statistics that the government themselves provided in their recent submission to the Grand Chamber show that while naming your perpetrators could be somewhat more effective, there's a lot of prosecutions of cases where the perpetrators are not named that are still successful in Macedonia.

<<5453.85;5463.21;en>>
It is a perfectly reasonable remedy, and in fact, the only course of action that was open to the applicant under the circumstances.

<<5463.21;5488.01;en>>
And finally, the government here for the first time introduced a new legal argument that, in fact, the statute of limitations has not lapsed to this day because of this supposed recharacterization of the offense by the Macedonian prosecutor.

<<5488.01;5517.57;en>>
We believe that there is no basis whatsoever under Macedonian law for that recharacterization because the provision used of the criminal code used by the prosecutor that was supposedly applicable here requires evidence of severe physical damage that Macedonian legal practice has interpreted as heavily debilitating physical and mental damage continuing for several years.

<<5517.57;5530.89;en>>
There was nothing in the applicant's criminal complaint arguing that there was that kind of severe debilitating harm within the meaning of Macedonian law.

<<5530.89;5537.61;en>>
And the reason for that is because we didn't think the evidence was there, otherwise we would have put it in there.

<<5537.61;5540.41;en>>
So there is a specific definition under Macedonian law.

<<5540.41;5546.73;en>>
So we do not believe that recharacterization by the prosecutor has a basis.

<<5546.73;5576.97;en>>
But that notwithstanding and irrespective, at this point in time, with the benefit of hindsight and having seen the reaction of the Macedonian investigative and criminal authorities to this case on this date, we do not believe that whatever theoretical remedies there may be in the law books in Macedonia, that those would, as of now, be of any effect.

<<5576.97;5583.57;en>>
And whatever they may be, we are no longer required to try and exhaust them.

<<5583.57;5583.93;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Nicolas Bratza]]

<<5587.28;5589.68;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Pavli.

<<5589.68;5593.0;en>>
We have then come to the end of the hearing.

<<5593.0;5599.36;en>>
I would like to thank the parties for their interventions and their answers to the court's questions.

<<5599.36;5603.48;en>>
The court will now deliberate on the admissibility and merits.

<<5603.48;5608.5;en>>
The court's decision and or judgment will be delivered later.

<<5608.5;5613.52;en>>
The parties will be informed of the date of delivery.

<<5613.52;5616.92;en>>
And the hearing, I declare the hearing closed.

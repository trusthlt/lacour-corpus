La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<65.89;73.77;en>>
Please be seated.

<<73.77;81.39;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of Fábián versus Hungary.

<<81.39;94.45;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on 5 December 2013 under Article 34 of the Convention by a Hungarian national, Mr. Gyula Fábián.

<<94.45;104.45;en>>
The application was allocated to the fourth section of the court pursuant to Rule 52, paragraph 1 of the rules of the court.

<<104.45;111.49;en>>
The application was communicated to the government on 25 August 2014.

<<111.49;120.09;en>>
On 15 December 2015, a chamber of the fourth section delivered its judgment in the case.

<<120.09;133.65;en>>
It held that there had been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and that it was not necessary to examine the

<<133.65;140.37;en>>
alleged violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1 taken on its own.

<<140.37;158.49;en>>
On 11 March 2016, the government requested that the case be referred to a grand chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention and the panel of the grand chamber accepted the request on 2 May 2016.

<<158.49;178.89;en>>
On 22 August 2016, the European Trade Union Confederation was granted leave under Article 36, paragraph 2 of the Convention and Rule 44, paragraph 3 of the rules of court to make written submissions to the court as a third party.

<<178.89;187.05;en>>
The government are represented by their agent, Mr. Zoltán Tallódi, of the Ministry of Justice,

<<187.05;192.77;en>>
assisted by Mrs. Mónika Weller of the same ministry as co-agent.

<<192.77;200.21;en>>
The applicant is represented by Mr. András Grád, counsel, assisted by Mrs. Rebeka Novák,

<<200.21;205.13;en>>
Mr. Dániel Karsai and Mr. Miklós Máté Kónya, advisors.

<<205.13;209.65;en>>
I welcome the representatives in the name of the court.

<<209.65;219.61;en>>
I also welcome the judges who are on a study visit to the court from Japan, Moldova, Norway, South Korea and Ukraine.

<<219.61;236.33;en>>
I would explain that, in addition to interpreting in the two official languages of the court, English and French, interpreting into Montenegrin and Russian has been authorized for the benefit of some of the groups of persons attending this hearing.

<<236.33;246.25;en>>
That interpreting is not arranged by the court and no transcription of the oral translation will be included in the official record of the proceedings.

<<246.25;255.09;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and the representative of the applicant, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<255.09;260.77;en>>
Mr. Grád, for the applicant, will speak first, and then Mr. Tallódi for the government.

<<260.77;261.77;en>>
I call Mr. Grád.

<<261.77;262.77;en>>
You have the floor, Mr. Grad, please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<266.39;269.95;en>>
Mr. President, Honorable Members of the Court,

<<269.95;282.47;en>>
Under Hungarian law there is a legal regulation which entered into force in 2013 ordering the disbursement of the pensions of those who continue working in the public sphere.

<<282.47;284.95;en>>
What is at stake in the present case?

<<284.95;294.75;en>>
It is undisputed that the applicant, as a Hungarian employee, month by month paid contributions to the Pension Fund of Hungary in his entire life.

<<294.75;302.87;en>>
His regular payments create a property right, namely a legitimate expectation of acquiring his pension.

<<302.87;308.39;en>>
That's why Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is clearly applicable in the present case.

<<308.39;317.71;en>>
However, the applicant was unfortunately deprived of his entire pension just because of the fact that he continued working in the public sector.

<<317.71;322.47;en>>
One could ask whether this intervention served the general interest.

<<322.55;329.75;en>>
The government naturally tried to substantiate this measure by referring to the general interest as such.

<<329.75;340.27;en>>
However, in fact, even the government could not rely insofar on any real specific aim sold by this harsh intervention to the applicant's property right.

<<340.27;352.43;en>>
In particular, it did not rely on or prove the government any causal link between the total deprivation at issue and the control of use of property in accordance with the general interest.

<<352.43;361.35;en>>
This is no wonder, as even according to the government, the Hungarian Pension Fund has year by year more income than expenditure.

<<361.35;375.67;en>>
Even the aim referred to by the government in general, allegedly to reduce public debt and help to escape the European Union's excessive deficit procedure, is unfortunately clearly invalid and untrue.

<<375.67;391.27;en>>
In fact, Hungary successfully got out of the European Union's excessive deficit procedure already on the 21st of June 2013, undisputedly prior to the start of the suspension of the applicant's pension.

<<391.27;397.39;en>>
In that respect, I would like to rely on attachment number three submitted to the court.

<<397.39;412.39;en>>
This is an article which discloses the fact that in reality, there is a yearly surplus in the state pension fund which amounted just in year 2014 to 183.3 billion Hungarian forints.

<<412.39;419.15;en>>
The government indicated insofar a number of different figures as the alleged savings of the budget.

<<419.15;431.99;en>>
Due to the impugned law, however, let me remind you that none of them was higher to 10 billion Hungarian forints per year, namely almost 20 times smaller to the above savings.

<<431.99;439.15;en>>
This fact is important as the government apparently tries to rely on the alleged financial troubles of the budget.

<<439.15;446.31;en>>
This 183.3 billion Hungarian forints surplus is a prime facie evidence

<<446.31;453.47;en>>
that the discrimination at issue cannot be substantiated by these alleged financial troubles.

<<453.47;465.99;en>>
In fact, the surplus disappeared in the state budget and served as the financial basis of, for instance, the renovation or building a number of football stadiums and so on.

<<465.99;471.07;en>>
The above facts in themselves can be regarded as a prime facie violation of the convention.

<<471.07;476.07;en>>
However, unfortunately, the situation is in fact much worse.

<<476.07;483.11;en>>
The applicant, similarly to some 2,000 other Hungarian pensioners, was discriminated two different ways.

<<483.11;497.71;en>>
First of all, he was discriminated against in respect of those pensioners who continued working in the private sphere and who could and still can have their respective pension without any restriction whatsoever.

<<497.71;506.31;en>>
These pensions are naturally paid from the very same Hungarian pension fund the applicant's one is supposed to be paid from.

<<506.31;511.67;en>>
This fact constitutes in itself a prime facie discrimination of the applicant.

<<511.67;517.55;en>>
However, the Hungarian legal regulation has an even more astonishing characteristic.

<<517.55;530.31;en>>
The law prescribing the total disbursement of pensions does not concern the entire population working in the public sphere, but there are some categories exempted from this regulation.

<<530.31;542.31;en>>
As the regulation indicates, just the categories concerned, but not those who are exempted, there is some uncertainty even at the government in respect of the categories exempted.

<<542.35;563.87;en>>
For instance, in point 26 of their memorial of 5 September 2016 to the court, even the government themselves admitted explicitly that ministers are exempted, while just a few weeks later in their submission of 30 September 2016, they stressed that all categories concerned are elected.

<<563.87;575.83;en>>
I would point out that ministers in Hungary have never ever been elected, in particular not since 2013 when the regulation at issue entered into force.

<<575.83;586.51;en>>
Moreover, in this latest submission of the government, nominates just two categories, namely members of parliament and mayors of municipal governments as exempted ones.

<<586.51;592.51;en>>
However, there are some more categories exempted from this legal regulation at issue.

<<592.51;596.95;en>>
For unknown reasons, this time not mentioned by the government at all.

<<596.95;605.11;en>>
In that respect, I would like to draw your attention to the report of the government, which is our attachment number one submitted to the court.

<<605.11;615.95;en>>
From this report to the government prepared by the Ministry of Justice in March 2016, it is perfectly clear that in fact there are several more categories exempted.

<<615.95;624.79;en>>
In Torelia, certain categories of judges, prosecutors and public officers employed who are not elected in Hungary either.

<<624.79;629.75;en>>
They are all nominated in different legally regulated procedures.

<<629.75;633.87;en>>
The above difference in treatment is purely arbitrary.

<<633.87;654.51;en>>
It has been not disputed by the government why members of parliament, mayors, members of local authorities, ministers and so on enjoying multiple remunerations should reserve their pension, whilst average public sphere workers like teachers, most of the judges, administrators and so on should not.

<<654.51;666.75;en>>
Even if all categories exempted from the above regulation would be elected, which is not the case, this still could not serve as a reasonable justification for the above difference in treatment.

<<666.75;673.63;en>>
Nevertheless, as we have seen, at least a few categories of those exempted from the regulation at issue are not elected.

<<673.63;680.23;en>>
For instance, ministers, certain categories of judges, prosecutors and public officers.

<<680.23;694.47;en>>
Another categorization could theoretically be based upon the distinction whether those who are exempted hold statuses regulated in the fundamental law as the Hungarian constitution at present is officially called.

<<694.47;710.27;en>>
However, we have to see it perfectly clear that a number of statuses are in fact regulated by the fundamental law, whilst the holders thereof are also deprived of their pension, for instance, most of the judges, public attorneys and so on.

<<710.27;723.87;en>>
Summing up the above categories, we must conclude that as far as the legal regulation at issue is concerned, we are unable to find any relevant category substantiating the present difference in treatment.

<<723.87;733.91;en>>
At least one part of pensioners belonging to each category is deprived of their pension, whilst on the other hand, the other part of the same population is not.

<<733.91;750.11;en>>
Accordingly, we can only conclude that the discrimination between the different groups of pensioners in the public sector is purely arbitrary and has nothing to do either with any legitimate aim or with any objective and reasonable justification.

<<750.11;762.07;en>>
Probably even the government themselves see this problem and that is the reason why in their observations submitted to the court relied on the alleged public sense of justice.

<<762.07;772.79;en>>
We have serious doubts whether such a vague and obscure principle could even theoretically serve as a reasonable justification of any discrimination.

<<772.79;783.67;en>>
It has however never been disputed even by the government that there has never been in Hungary any public debate in this respect, not even a simple public opinion research.

<<783.67;790.87;en>>
Accordingly, the government is not in a position to rely on any evidence whatsoever in that respect.

<<790.87;801.87;en>>
Nevertheless, it is well known from history that the public sense of justice, if there is any at all, can be very easily manipulated by the regime.

<<801.91;823.27;en>>
If the public sense of justice could be accepted as a legitimate ground or aim, any government could easily form the public feeling the way that is suitable for the regime's actual aims, irrespectively whether it is compatible with the obligations of the convention or other international covenants or not.

<<823.27;835.83;en>>
In this respect, I would draw attention also to the fact that the court found violation in the case of Heschman and Harrop versus the United Kingdom, judgment 25 November 1999.

<<835.83;854.55;en>>
In this case, conduct contra bonos mores, which was defined as behavior which is wrong rather than right in the judgment of the majority of contemporary fellow citizens, did not meet the requirement of foreseeability, see paragraphs 29 to 45.

<<854.55;864.59;en>>
Consequently, as far as a legitimate aim is concerned, such a referral casts serious doubts concerning the lawfulness of the measure in question.

<<864.59;883.83;en>>
Insofar, when I was speaking about the lack of a legitimate aim and the lack of an objective and reasonable justification in respect of the discrimination, both of them concerned the legal regulation at issue, namely the amendment of the Pension Act, Act 91 of 1997.

<<883.83;886.87;en>>
This Act gives a somewhat vague and obscure list.

<<886.87;899.35;en>>
However, due to the Act, it is perfectly clear that teachers, medical care employees, administrative officers, and so on, working in the public sector are not exempted from this list.

<<899.39;920.31;en>>
However, there is a further legal regulation in Hungary, namely Act 84 of 2003, which provides the theoretical opportunity to individual cases that the entire amount of pension suspended by the amendment of the Pension Act could be reimbursed from the same national budget.

<<920.31;923.83;en>>
Yes, Mr. President, members of the court, you understood it correctly.

<<923.83;937.31;en>>
The government deprives a particular group of people from their respective pension, in fact, take the money out of their packet, and to some of them, put it back to their same pocket.

<<937.31;945.67;en>>
Nobody in Hungary did know the exact amount of people concerned, as the selection was in each case merely individual.

<<945.67;959.27;en>>
The government prepared no public reports in respect of the number of public employees provided with this income support, as it is officially called, neither in respect of the relevant financial figures.

<<959.27;965.11;en>>
The ugly truth became clear to the applicant only from the above report to the government.

<<965.11;974.95;en>>
The applicant submitted as attachment number two, the relevant parts of Act 84 of 2003 in respect of the health care activities.

<<974.95;992.43;en>>
Rules 16A to 16D thereof declare an opportunity for those employed in the health care field to recover the entire amount of pension suspended under the present legal regulation at issue in the official form of so-called income support.

<<992.43;996.27;en>>
In the legal regulation, this is a theoretical opportunity.

<<996.27;1002.95;en>>
Moreover, the amount of the reimbursement is also vague, as it cannot be higher to the amount suspended.

<<1002.95;1028.67;en>>
However, from the report to the government prepared by the Ministry of Justice, submitted to the court as attachment number one of the present hearing, it became perfectly clear that in practice, the reimbursement, the so-called income support, is not just a theoretical opportunity, but the general practice, and the amount thereof is in each case equal to the pension suspended.

<<1028.71;1056.19;en>>
From this report, it became clear to the applicant that despite the approximately 4,000 people concerned officially by the total disbursement of pensions, in reality, this measure infected just half of this population, as the pension of all ever was compensated by the government as income support, and all health care pensioners were reimbursed their entire amount of pension.

<<1056.19;1067.91;en>>
I would like to make it perfectly clear that is not the reimbursement of pensions in respect of the health care pensioners, which the applicant considers intolerable under the convention.

<<1067.91;1074.03;en>>
What is in fact intolerable is the totally arbitrary nature of the discrimination.

<<1074.03;1094.39;en>>
The government first discriminate between the public and private employees by suspending the pension only of the public employees, then create artificially two groups within public employees and grant to one of these groups their entire respective pension, whilst confiscate the total respective pension of the other.

<<1094.39;1103.59;en>>
Even without any further discrimination, the above situation constitutes a prima facie violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1,

<<1103.59;1107.79;en>>
taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the convention.

<<1107.79;1124.63;en>>
However, as we have seen, there is a third discrimination, even within the latter group, as due to the report, it became clear that the government exempt particular persons or groups in a procedure which is anything but transparent.

<<1124.63;1138.79;en>>
This discrimination can only be regarded as totally arbitrary, and it constitutes, even in itself, a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the convention.

<<1138.79;1153.59;en>>
The above facts could be one of the reasons why the government provided the Honorable Court with totally divergent and inconsistent figures regarding the real impact of the legal regulation at issue on the national budget.

<<1153.59;1184.47;en>>
In this respect, the applicant would like to draw the attention of the Honorable Court to the fact that whilst the government, in their memorial of 5 September 2016, stressed that due to the present legal regulations at issue, the total savings between March 2013 and August 2016 amounted to some 30.6 billion Hungarian forints, this calculation and figures indicated on pages 16 to 19 are totally misleading.

<<1184.47;1197.91;en>>
In order to substantiate this statement, I would refer again to the report to the government, referred to as Attachment No. 1, from which it is perfectly clear that in fact these figures are not valid.

<<1197.91;1202.47;en>>
Just as an example, I would rely on the year 2015.

<<1202.47;1210.47;en>>
In that respect, the government stressed on page No. 18 of their memorial that the savings of this particular year

<<1210.47;1215.11;en>>
amounted to almost 9.5 billion Hungarian forints.

<<1215.11;1232.47;en>>
However, in the report to the government, the Ministry of Justice stressed that in fact the savings amounted in 2015 not even to 4.3 billion Hungarian forints, namely much less than half of the official figure.

<<1232.47;1249.03;en>>
In point 43 of the memorial, even the government themselves referred to the fact that the above amount of savings are to be deducted by the amount reimbursed by the National Health Fund to those public employees who work in the healthcare field.

<<1249.03;1256.39;en>>
This part of the memorial is, however, somewhat ambiguous and the figures turn to be more and more chaotic.

<<1256.39;1262.63;en>>
For instance, the government themselves state that the amount of some 30.6 billion Hungarian forints

<<1262.63;1275.19;en>>
calculated at the end of their memorial is to be deducted by the above compensation, however, failed to inform the Honorable Court in respect of the real figures concerned.

<<1275.19;1293.11;en>>
At this point, I would draw the attention of the Honorable Court that insofar the government have relied on a number of figures as alleged savings due to the legal regulations at issue, however, all figures are totally inconsistent even regarding a specific year.

<<1293.11;1299.75;en>>
Nevertheless, just one thing became from Attachment No. 1, the report to the government, perfectly clear,

<<1299.75;1313.67;en>>
namely that from approximately 2 million Hungarian pensioners, the impugned low at issue in fact concerns just 2,000 people, just an extremely small minority.

<<1313.67;1326.71;en>>
The government allege if the pensions suspended by the present legal regulation at issue should be paid to the persons concerned, it would have serious impact on the Hungarian budget.

<<1326.71;1334.47;en>>
Mr. President, members of the Court, if this story were not such a sad one depriving some 2,000 old Hungarian pensioners,

<<1334.47;1343.11;en>>
including the applicant, from their entire respective pension, I would rather say that this statement is simply ridiculous.

<<1343.11;1374.07;en>>
In fact, while the government tries to convince the Honorable Court in respect of the allegedly serious impact of the present case to the budget, on the other hand, the government spent in the recent years fortunes on futile projects, for example, they spent within some years 307 billion Hungarian forints just to build and renew football stadiums.

<<1374.07;1381.67;en>>
All these stadiums are in fact empty due to the long and deep crisis of the Hungarian football.

<<1381.67;1395.67;en>>
Accordingly, it is almost totally irrelevant whether we speak about 4 or 9 billion Hungarian forints, as just for these stadiums the government spent some 100 times more.

<<1395.67;1417.03;en>>
When stressing that the abolishment of the present discriminatory regulation at issue would cause serious impact on the budget, the government also stated that the Chamber judgment in its present form might entail serious consequences concerning the social security system of a number of member states.

<<1417.03;1440.23;en>>
The government also stated that there was a number of Council of Europe member states having identical or similar legal regulations in their respective national law, provided that the person concerned is simultaneously in receipt of a salary and pension, for instance, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Romania, Greece, Iceland, Slovakia, and so on.

<<1440.23;1452.47;en>>
As a consequence, the Court requested the government to submit evidence related to the alleged similarities between the Hungarian measures and those applied in the other member states.

<<1452.47;1472.95;en>>
As the outcome of this comparison, it became perfectly clear that among the member states of the Council of Europe, there is no state whatsoever having not just an identical but even a little bit similar legal restriction, in particular, there does not even exist any similar discrimination.

<<1472.95;1481.99;en>>
This fact is substantiated also by the neutral and thorough third-party submissions of the European Trade Union Confederation.

<<1481.99;1498.07;en>>
Accordingly, the allegation of the government, namely that the present case involves a serious issue of general importance due to the repercussion in many other member states, has in fact nothing to do with the truth and reality.

<<1498.07;1511.11;en>>
I would briefly reflect on the question related to the problem whether the six-month rule was observed concerning the complaint against the discrimination between various types of civil servants.

<<1511.11;1519.19;en>>
First, I note that the applicant in his original application complained about the discrimination against civil servants in general.

<<1519.19;1526.71;en>>
He asked for the Court's examination concerning the whole legal shame in question as such.

<<1526.71;1533.35;en>>
As to the alleged violation of Protocol No. 1 taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention,

<<1533.35;1541.99;en>>
in page 7, paragraph 1, the applicant gave an indicative enumeration of the possible grounds of discrimination.

<<1541.99;1559.11;en>>
Moreover, still in that respect, in page 8, paragraph 2, the applicant also stressed that pension is disbursed by the present amendment of law only regarding a specifically defined group of individuals.

<<1559.11;1572.55;en>>
Later, in his counter-observations before the Chamber, he simply developed further his arguments concerning the discrimination, which has several branches in the present case.

<<1572.55;1581.35;en>>
However, it is important for us to see that these branches belong to the same tree, both from factual and legal point of view.

<<1581.35;1591.35;en>>
In these circumstances, he cannot be classified as not bringing, at least in substance, his claim before the Court within the six-month time limit.

<<1591.35;1600.15;en>>
I nevertheless disagree with the government as to the continuous nature of the prejudice caused.

<<1600.15;1614.23;en>>
The present case can easily be distinguished from the case law quoted by the government, as in the present case the infringement occurred repeatedly every month, each time when the applicant did not receive his due pension.

<<1614.23;1617.99;en>>
Such a situation, however, does not last practically forever.

<<1617.99;1627.67;en>>
In fact, it lasts only until the termination of the employment, exactly as it occurred also in the applicant's case.

<<1627.67;1639.19;en>>
This is a second type of the notion of a continuous violation, completely different from losing fishing rights or legitimate expectation to pursue certain economic activities.

<<1639.19;1655.11;en>>
In this respect, I would moreover point out that, as admitted by the government as well, the pension authority issued also decisions in respect of the yearly increasing of the applicant's pension due to the fact that he continued working.

<<1655.11;1662.07;en>>
According to these decisions, his pension increased by 0.5 percent each year.

<<1662.07;1681.35;en>>
This is a clear evidence that there was no final decision or legal act in this respect, as the State was permanently active, provided the applicant with information letters in respect of the increasing of his pension, and also decisions each year regarding his pension suspended by law.

<<1681.35;1687.59;en>>
Therefore, in the present case, the observance of the six-month rule should be established.

<<1687.59;1704.31;en>>
In this respect, I draw attention to the fact that, to my best knowledge, there are hundreds of similar cases pending before the Court, which complaints raise similar issues of discrimination, including the discrimination between different types of civil servants.

<<1704.31;1732.31;en>>
If the Court decides to strike this question, this time out of the scope of examination, it would go against, at least to a certain extent, the principle of the effective protection of the Conventional rights, since, if this serious issue will not be answered now, only in a later occasion, the effective protection of the rights in question is somewhat weakened.

<<1732.31;1746.87;en>>
Both in their request, the case to be transferred before the Grand Chamber, and in their memorial, the Government stressed that the facts of the present case are, in practical terms, identical with those of the Panfila v. Romania judgment.

<<1746.87;1754.47;en>>
Mr. President, Members of the Court, I would not reiterate all the four important grounds described in my memorial,

<<1754.47;1759.43;en>>
on which the present case is, in fact, to be distinguished from the Panfila one.

<<1759.43;1767.43;en>>
Nevertheless, there is a ground which is in particular important, namely the lack of a financial crisis.

<<1767.43;1775.75;en>>
The legal regulations governing the Panfila case aimed at handling a deep financial crisis.

<<1775.75;1780.15;en>>
This financial crisis did not exist in the present case at all.

<<1780.15;1793.59;en>>
Moreover, I would also note that not just the Ombudsman requested the Constitutional Court to abolish this particular regulation, but also the Hungarian Supreme Court itself.

<<1793.59;1807.35;en>>
I enclose this attachment number 4 summary, published by the Press Secretariat of the Curia, as the Hungarian Supreme Court is now called, which is based upon a number of particular Supreme Court decisions.

<<1807.35;1818.71;en>>
These decisions suspended cases and transferred them to the Constitutional Court, relying on the unconstitutional nature of the present legal regulations at issue.

<<1818.71;1827.59;en>>
The summary issued by the Curia is an evidence that even the Curia found the legal regulations at issue contrary to the fundamental law.

<<1827.59;1843.51;en>>
As a consequence of the unconstitutional nature of the impugned law, detailed in the present summary, the Supreme Court, similarly to the Ombudsman, also initiated a procedure before the Constitutional Court, which is still pending as well.

<<1843.51;1862.71;en>>
Summing up the above-mentioned arguments briefly, in my view, the Chamber judgment of the Court should be upheld as the applicant was in fact discriminated against in respect of the disbursement of his pension, and as the case can and should, on several grounds, be distinguished from the Panfila one.

<<1862.71;1871.43;en>>
Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention, read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

<<1871.43;1873.35;en>>
Mr. President, Honorable Members of the Court, thank you for your attention.

<<1876.82;1879.06;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Grád.

<<1879.06;1880.42;en>>
Now I call Mr. Tallódi.

<<1880.42;1880.42;en>>
Please, you have the floor.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<1887.62;1890.62;en>>
Mr. President, Honorable Members of the Court, Ladies and Gentlemen,

<<1890.62;1899.43;en>>
It is a privilege and a pleasure to have the opportunity to appear before the Court to present the oral submissions on behalf of the Government in Hungary.

<<1899.43;1912.47;en>>
Let me start with a brief description of the origin and the purpose of pension systems in general, and the major characteristics and relevant developments in the Hungarian pension system in particular.

<<1912.47;1927.31;en>>
Pension systems were originally established for the purpose of providing a security of livelihood after retirement from work at old age when workers were no longer able to provide for their means of subsistence by working.

<<1927.31;1938.99;en>>
Historically, there were insurance pension schemes and social security pension schemes in which contributory and solidarity elements intermingled to various degrees.

<<1938.99;1944.71;en>>
In Hungary, the solidarity elements became absolutely predominant in the communist era.

<<1944.71;1950.51;en>>
In the transition period, the pension system was used and abused to avoid unemployment.

<<1950.51;1958.03;en>>
Over the years, millions of people benefited from some form of early retirement scheme.

<<1958.03;1966.55;en>>
Considerations of employment policy and social policy in the wider sense influenced the regulation of pension benefits.

<<1966.55;1983.66;en>>
Despite efforts to move towards a more contributory system, solidarity elements, especially due to past obligations, acquired rights, remained predominant at least on a general level, if not from each individual's point of view.

<<1983.66;2009.87;en>>
In Hungary, the pension system operates in a pay-as-you-go system, which, similarly to the pension systems of many European countries, has faced serious challenges due to the adverse impact of long-term population aging and its consequences, namely the high ratio of pension receivers as compared to the ratio of contribution payers.

<<2009.87;2033.18;en>>
In Hungary, this situation was only made worse by the fact that after the year of 1989, several privilege-based allowances designated as pensions transitioned, but in fact not covered by any separate employer or employee-paid contributions to the pension fund, were retained for certain occupational groups.

<<2033.18;2055.33;en>>
Moreover, in addition to the demographic factors, the proportion of social security contributors further decreased due to the statutory availability of early retirement schemes, inducing to opt for early retirement and simultaneously working as a pensioner under preferential tax treatment.

<<2055.33;2082.39;en>>
That is, quite contrary to the original aim and function of pensions, such allowances were paid not only to retirees having withdrawn from the labour market, but also to persons active in that market, thereby decreasing the number of job offers available in the labour market to contribution payers and further undermining the sustainability of the social security system.

<<2082.39;2095.33;en>>
Due to Hungary's significant budgetary deficit and public debt, this situation, deteriorated by the 2008 world economic crisis, became unsustainable.

<<2095.33;2121.35;en>>
From 2008 on, a restriction was introduced in respect of pensioner employees not having reached the retirement age, under which, upon reaching a work income ceiling first 12 times, then 18 times, of the minimum wage, pension disbursements had to be suspended irrespective of whether it was earned in the private or the public sector.

<<2121.35;2142.78;en>>
This restriction, which in 2008 was not applicable to service pensioners and was abolished in 2010 for persons who retired prior to 2008, didn't prove to be sufficient for securing the sustainability of the pension system, hence further reforms were required.

<<2142.78;2154.74;en>>
In March 2011, the government decided to take measures to make the spending of the pension fund more calculable, with an emphasis on its contributory nature.

<<2154.74;2182.78;en>>
The government decided that in the future the pension fund would only pay benefits to those who had reached the retirement age, money collected from pension contributions of the employee population would only be spent on pension benefits and all entitlements allowing persons capable of work to retire before reaching the statutory age limit would be abolished.

<<2182.78;2214.66;en>>
The reasoning of the Act of 2011 on the elimination of early retirement pensions on pre-retirement allowance and service allowance, adopted in order to realise the above objective, stated that early retirement pensions disbursable from the pension fund had only been partly covered by pension contributions and their disbursement could only be secured from the central budget instead of the pension fund by increasing public debt.

<<2214.66;2230.14;en>>
The aim of the reform was to ensure that pensions costs do not in the future exceed the revenues gained from pension contributions and that all payments made from the central budget do appear in that budget as expenditure.

<<2230.14;2236.55;en>>
Thereby the type of allowance received and the source of its funding should become clear to all beneficiaries.

<<2236.55;2249.66;en>>
For a transition period some under retirement age benefits still remained in the pension fund's budget, the deficit of which is anyway financed by the state budget.

<<2249.66;2257.03;en>>
In 2012 the entitlement of 1.1 million people were rearranged and the number of pensioners

<<2257.03;2262.07;en>>
receiving their benefits from the pension fund decreased by 18%.

<<2262.07;2271.82;en>>
As a result the proportion of old age pensioners increased from 80% to 92% amongst the beneficiaries of the pension fund.

<<2271.82;2289.07;en>>
A further element of the reform, balancing the short term and long term interests of the pension fund, was the abolition of the ceiling of pension contributions which was criticised by the applicant in his memorial as an alleged abolition of the maximal amount of a monthly pension.

<<2289.07;2294.28;en>>
The applicant's allegations are wrong and maliciously misrepresent the truth.

<<2294.28;2310.62;en>>
It was not a ceiling on the amount of monthly pension that was abolished by a ceiling on monthly pension contributions which in the short term results in more contributions being paid to the pension fund.

<<2310.62;2329.78;en>>
Contrary to the applicant's allegations no maximal amount of pension had been set by law before 2012, the amount of 1,000 euro indicated by the applicant was a calculated amount based on maximum contributions in case of retirement at the age of 62.

<<2329.78;2341.87;en>>
However, retirement well after the pensionable age and a very long service period could result in a pension of more than 2,000 euro already in 2011.

<<2341.87;2365.78;en>>
In the short run the abolition of the ceiling on pension contributions resulted in a significant increase in the revenues of the pension fund and while in the long run it may also contribute to an increase of its expenditures, there are still significant constraints to that development, namely a highly degressive calculation of the amount of the pension.

<<2365.78;2381.31;en>>
Parallel to the measures of social security policy, the government also took action in the field of employment policy with a double aim of reducing public debt and ensuring a fairer system of burden sharing and distribution of public funds.

<<2381.31;2388.66;en>>
In 2012 new provisions were introduced concerning the employment of pensioners in the public sector.

<<2388.66;2409.27;en>>
Compulsory retirement at the statutory pensionable age with a prohibition of re-employment was introduced as a means of facilitating the reduction of the number of public employees and downsizing civil service where appropriate or of reducing unemployment of younger people.

<<2409.27;2432.74;en>>
However, this measure was applicable only to the central government, ministries and their subordinate bodies with the scarce possibility of individual exceptions while local governments were not obliged to dismiss their employees who were already entitled to receive pension benefits including early retirement benefits.

<<2432.74;2450.43;en>>
Local government's employees were given a choice whether to discontinue the employment and continue to receive pension benefits or if it was more favourable to them to continue the employment relationship with the suspension of the disbursement of pension benefits.

<<2450.43;2475.43;en>>
Most early retirement pensioners working in the public sector as well as in the private sector had already been subject to an income ceiling under Section 83B of the Pension Act, a yearly income of 18 times the minimal wage since 2008 with a few exceptions including service pensioners like the applicant.

<<2475.43;2499.43;en>>
The extension of the restriction by way of Section 83C of the Pension Act in the public sector to old age pensioners and all formerly privileged early retirement pensioners in respect of the total sum of the pension was intended to ensure a fairer system of burden sharing and distribution of public funds.

<<2499.43;2512.07;en>>
Actually it was a strong incentive for public servants to retire from office and only continue to work if it was an option more favourable for them than being a pensioner.

<<2512.07;2528.14;en>>
It has thus become part of the status of various categories of public servants that they were expected to stop abusing the pension system and share the burdens of solidarity in exchange for better incomes from the public budget.

<<2528.14;2550.39;en>>
Where shortage of staff made the continued employment of pensioners necessary, such as in the healthcare sector, where salaries were very low, the discretionary payment of a salary supplement was made possible at the expense of the public budget but not from the pension fund.

<<2550.39;2563.23;en>>
Calculating from the increase of the applicant's pension between 2013 and 2016, we can conclude that the applicant must have received similar compensation from his public employer.

<<2563.23;2581.39;en>>
Public employees employed under the Labour Code in a less privileged status than various categories of public servants and usually receiving lower wages remained subject to the income ceiling set by Section 33B of the Pension Act up until reaching the pensionable age.

<<2581.39;2585.99;en>>
Only elected public officials remained exempt from these restrictions.

<<2585.99;2592.47;en>>
The Government notes that some of the measures described above have already been examined by the Court.

<<2592.47;2599.51;en>>
In the cases of Markovic and others v. Hungary concerning the transformation of service pensions,

<<2599.51;2619.11;en>>
the Court accepted in its admissibility decision of 24 June 2014 that the above described general interest of economic and social policies pursued by the measures complained of qualified as a legitimate aim for the purposes of the Convention.

<<2619.11;2656.18;en>>
Although the applicants in that case similarly to the applicants in the present case disputed the adequacy of the measures of the quantitative significance of their effects, the Court argued that, provided that the legislator chose a method that could be regarded as reasonable and suited to achieving the legitimate aim being pursued, it is not for the Court to say whether the legislation represented the best solution for dealing with the problem or whether the legislative discretion should have been exercised in another way.

<<2656.18;2665.95;en>>
It also observed that the contested measure was part of a whole range of measures implemented with the aim of reducing public spending.

<<2665.95;2684.47;en>>
In this context, the Government further recalled that, according to the Court's case law, the margin of appreciation available to the legislator in implementing policies concerning pensions or welfare benefits, as well as employment policies, since they involve economic and social issues, should be a wide one.

<<2684.47;2707.82;en>>
In this context, the Court must respect not only the judgment of constitutional courts on the aims and necessity of the policy measures, but also the assessment of the democratically elected legislator, whose wide margin of discretion in such issues must be respected even by domestic judicial authorities pursuant to the principle of distribution of public powers.

<<2707.82;2730.27;en>>
In response to the applicants' comments challenging the legitimacy of the aims of the above measures on account of the termination of the excessive deficit procedure against Hungary by the European Union, the Government noted that having successfully curtailed an excessive deficit does not mean that a balanced budget has already been achieved or that the balance is sustainable.

<<2730.27;2739.11;en>>
Getting off the excessive deficit procedure doesn't mean that the State can resume spending the public budget in an unsustainable manner.

<<2739.11;2769.99;en>>
In response to the applicants' further comments on some budgetary spending not to his liking, the Government noted that from the perspective of sustainability, smaller but recurrent and long-term expenditures are far more significant than one-time large-scale public projects which, in any event, have far more complex budgetary effects than could be presented here even if they were relevant.

<<2769.99;2774.82;en>>
Mr. President, Honourable Members of the Court, Ladies and Gentlemen,

<<2774.82;2779.39;en>>
The general background of the measure complained of having been explained.

<<2779.39;2785.11;en>>
Next I will attempt to evaluate its effect on the applicant's situation.

<<2785.11;2801.35;en>>
However this exercise is greatly hindered by the fact that the applicant hasn't shared very much relevant information about his individual case but has tried to have this case determined on the general level of an actio popularis.

<<2801.35;2810.51;en>>
The applicant who was born in 1953 reached the statutory retirement age in 2016.

<<2810.51;2824.36;en>>
It is clear, therefore, that at the time of the event's complaint of the applicant was not the recipient of old-age pension as such but the beneficiary of an early retirement pension scheme.

<<2824.36;2830.51;en>>
He has enjoyed these benefits since 2001, since his age of 47.

<<2830.51;2832.78;en>>
He retired after 30 years of service.

<<2832.78;2847.18;en>>
Neither the applicant nor his employer had ever paid any additional pension contribution in order to cover the additional costs of the preferential pension treatment embodied in the longer disbursement period.

<<2847.18;2858.31;en>>
The applicant then continued to work in the public sector and benefited from the possibility of drawing double income from the public budget for more than 12 years.

<<2858.31;2863.95;en>>
Until 2007 he hadn't even had to pay pension contribution.

<<2863.95;2871.62;en>>
His pension alone was higher than average and we must presume he received an even higher salary.

<<2871.62;2888.11;en>>
The applicant's pension in 2013 was approximately 540 euro while the average pension was 320 euro, about the same as the gross minimum wage.

<<2888.11;2891.74;en>>
And the average net income was about 500 euro.

<<2891.74;2906.59;en>>
In 2012 more than 90,000 people received less than one third of the applicant's pension and about 1.3 million, more than half of the 2.2 million pensioners, received no more than

<<2906.59;2909.26;en>>
two thirds of the applicant's pension.

<<2909.26;2916.27;en>>
Only about 2 to 300,000 persons received higher amounts of pension than the applicant.

<<2916.27;2928.66;en>>
The highest pensions were mostly earned by significantly longer service periods by continuing to work well after the retirement age without simultaneously receiving pension benefits.

<<2928.66;2932.77;en>>
In contrast, the applicant retired after 30 years of service.

<<2932.77;2942.99;en>>
Thus the applicant had already had his fair share of solidarity as a recipient in the pension system when the restriction complaint was introduced.

<<2942.99;2953.99;en>>
In light of the above statistical data, the applicant having to make a choice between his two sources of income from the public budget did in no way endanger his subsistence.

<<2953.99;2967.97;en>>
In 2013 the minimum subsistence amount for an active adult was about 290 euro and it was 210 euro per person in an average household.

<<2967.97;2973.87;en>>
In the same period the net minimum wage was 2 to 300 euro depending on tax reliefs.

<<2973.87;2984.03;en>>
Therefore the applicant was in a more favorable position with respect to either of his sources of income than the average person in any group of income recipients.

<<2984.03;2996.47;en>>
It was only after 12 years of enjoying the benefits of solidarity when the applicant was expected to share some of the burdens of that solidarity as a member of a privileged group of public servants.

<<2996.47;3002.55;en>>
He was not deprived of any of his pension benefits by the discretion of the authorities.

<<3002.55;3015.35;en>>
Similarly to the applicant in the Panfila versus Romania case, the applicant in this case was given an option to choose between being employed and being retired.

<<3015.35;3044.26;en>>
The only essential difference was that the Romanian legislation presumed that the persons concerned would choose their pensions and in default of the employee's decision to the contrary provided for dismissal from employment while the Hungarian legislature presumed that the persons concerned would choose to keep their full salary instead of their pensions and adopted rules for the suspension of the disbursement of pensions.

<<3044.26;3058.03;en>>
Thus it was the result of the applicant's own decision that the disbursement of his pension was temporarily suspended in order to enable him to enjoy the greater benefits of being employed in the public service.

<<3058.03;3094.03;en>>
Moreover although the payment of the pecuniary benefits was suspended for the relevant period, the applicant retained his legal status as a pensioner and continued to enjoy an ancillary benefits of an in-kind nature dependent on the status of pensioners which were although not part of the insurance expectations, sufficiently significant to prompt thousands of former service pensioners like the applicants in the case of Markovic and others to complain about their losses to an international tribunal.

<<3094.03;3120.23;en>>
Furthermore in a longer term, suspension of the disbursement of the pension was rewarded with an increase of salary and a corresponding more sufficient increase of the amount of the pension by 0.5% of the average salary earned during the suspension in accordance

<<3120.23;3123.74;en>>
with Article 22A of the Pension Act.

<<3123.74;3137.47;en>>
This measure was first introduced in 2007 on a voluntary basis available at the request of the pensioner which proves that this arrangement can be favourable to pensioners in the long run.

<<3137.47;3151.09;en>>
Therefore the interference complained of similarly to the cases of Markovic and others didn't amount to a deprivation of possessions within the meaning of the second sentence of the paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

<<3151.09;3185.31;en>>
It is rather to be regarded as an interference with the applicant's right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of the first paragraph in light of the effort set the legitimate aim of the interference cannot be called into question and the applicant cannot be considered to have had to bear an excessive individual burden of solidarity in the course of creating a fairer system of public burden sharing and a more sustainable structure of public expenditures.

<<3185.31;3190.07;en>>
Mr. President, Honourable Members of the Court, Ladies and Gentlemen, the next issue we must

<<3190.07;3204.9;en>>
examine is whether the applicant was in a position analogous to any of the groups of persons whom he claims were treated more favourable than himself in breach of the prohibition of discrimination under Article 14.

<<3204.9;3217.47;en>>
The grounds for the prohibited different treatment enumerated in Article 14 in an open-ended manner can be explained in terms of the most basic personal characteristics of an individual.

<<3217.47;3240.95;en>>
Although other status has been interpreted by the Court to include status as a civil servant, it was only to conclude that civil servants were not in analogous position to workers of the private sector for pension purposes or that the difference of treatment was justified by the legal differences of the respective statuses.

<<3240.95;3270.11;en>>
The Government are of the opinion that the legal status as a civil servant can hardly be regarded as a defining element of someone's personality and therefore the option of leaving civil service as a means to avoid any disadvantages attached to that status cannot be compared to changing a person's nationality and thus the Court's finding in the case of Andreeva v Latvia have no relevance to the present case.

<<3270.11;3288.23;en>>
Furthermore, the Government do not claim that the applicant could have avoided discrimination by changing his legal status as a civil servant but that he could have avoided the adverse effects of the measure complained of by changing that status.

<<3288.23;3292.55;en>>
Not all adverse effects of a measure amount to discrimination.

<<3292.55;3314.74;en>>
In the present case, the different treatment based on the nature of an employment relationship resulting in the creation of various categories of civil servants with different legal statuses is a different treatment based on factual differences and characteristics of an objective and reasonable nature.

<<3314.74;3323.43;en>>
In such circumstances, such a difference doesn't amount to discriminatory treatment within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention.

<<3323.43;3357.74;en>>
As regards the difference in treatment between retired persons who were still active in the private sector and those who were in the public sector, like the applicant, the Court clearly saw in the case of Pamfila v Romania that the two categories of persons can hardly be regarded as being in an analogous or relevantly similar situation within the meaning of Article 14, since the essential distinction is that they drew their incomes from different sources, namely a private budget and a state budget respectively.

<<3357.74;3385.47;en>>
It was only in the present case that the Chamber found the two groups to be in analogous position by relying on the single common feature, namely that they didn't need an income substitute since they all had an income from work, which is not relevant from the perspective of the aims pursued by contested measure, but only an aspect to be taken into account in assessing its proportionality.

<<3385.47;3394.2;en>>
From the perspective of the reasons for introducing the restriction, the two groups were in a different position in many essential aspects.

<<3394.2;3417.43;en>>
Another distinctive feature is that in respect of public employees, the State is not only in the position of a regulator in the field of employment policy, but it is in the position of the employer, and thus it can directly execute its employment policy without having to consider implications of interference with private law relationships.

<<3417.43;3444.78;en>>
Further differences, and this will also explain the difference of treatment between certain categories of employees within the public sector itself, that public servants subjected to the restriction complained of have a special duty of loyalty to the State and an obligation to observe certain ethical norms which are not applicable to those who are employed in the private sector or under the rules of the labor code.

<<3444.78;3451.94;en>>
The restriction introduced by the contested legislation corresponds to an ethical obligation not to abuse the law.

<<3451.95;3470.15;en>>
Although enjoying retirement benefits without actual retirement was not illegal, it was unethical in the sense that it maximized personal advantages to the detriment of the community, especially to the detriment of those who were in bigger need of social solidarity.

<<3470.15;3488.59;en>>
As to the alleged discrimination within the public sector itself, which complaint was not raised before the court within the six-month time limit, the government knows that in Hungary there are a number of various categories of civil servants with legal statuses defined by different set of rights and obligations.

<<3488.59;3519.27;en>>
The common denominator is not only that they are paid from the public budget, but they also enjoy special privileges as compared to those employed under the rules of the labor code in terms of job security and protection against dismissal from service, and in turn they are subject to a special duty of loyalty to the state and to the obligation to observe some rules of ethics, both in the professional conduct and private lives.

<<3519.27;3526.55;en>>
All these categories of civil servant are subject to the restriction under Section 83C of the Pension Act.

<<3526.55;3532.66;en>>
Therefore the issue of different treatment between various categories of civil servants doesn't arise.

<<3532.66;3539.62;en>>
Prison prosecutors on administrative leave or in reserve status seem to be the exceptions.

<<3539.62;3557.11;en>>
However, they are not in the same position as all other civil servants since their status is the result of the impossibility to reinstate them in their former positions after then unlawful dismissal, and they do not receive their full salaries.

<<3557.11;3563.78;en>>
Such circumstances justify their different treatment for the purposes of the legislation complained of.

<<3563.78;3571.82;en>>
There are further categories of persons who do receive salaries from the public budget, but are not in the status of public servants.

<<3571.82;3578.9;en>>
Among them are members of Parliament and mayors who are not subject to the restriction complained of.

<<3578.9;3604.31;en>>
However, they are not in the same position as public servants because they are elected public officials and an encouragement of the resignation from office in line with one of the complex purposes of the legislation complained of would constitute an interference with their right to stand for election, as well as the right to free elections of their electorate.

<<3604.31;3610.51;en>>
Contrary to the Chamber's findings, government ministers are not exempted from this role.

<<3610.51;3628.31;en>>
The final category of public employees not subject to the restriction under 83C of the Pension Act is the group of those employees who are employed under the rules of the Labour Code for tasks not related to the exercise of public powers.

<<3628.31;3642.74;en>>
They are, however, not subject to the same legal protection and ethical requirements as various categories of public servants are, and this is not a typical form of employment of pensioners in the public sector.

<<3642.74;3654.95;en>>
Other contracts can also be concluded for atypical, such as part-time work, which is only exceptionally available to civil servants, typically to mothers with small children.

<<3654.95;3667.62;en>>
In sum, when two groups of people are not in comparable situations from all relevant aspects of the aims of the measure complained of, no issue of discrimination between them can arise.

<<3667.62;3674.47;en>>
Mr. President, Honourable Members of the Court, Ladies and Gentlemen, In light of the effort

<<3674.47;3685.14;en>>
cited, I respectfully ask the Court to conclude that, insofar as the application is admissible, there has been no violation of the applicants' rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of

<<3685.14;3700.78;en>>
the Convention, taken alone or in conjunction with Article 14, and to reject the applicants' highly excessive claims for just satisfaction, which cannot be regarded as necessarily incurred or reasonable as to quantum.

<<3700.78;3703.35;en>>
That concludes what I wish to say at this stage.

<<3703.35;3708.39;en>>
May I thank you, Mr. President and Members of the Court, for listening to me so patiently

<<3708.39;3708.39;en>>
and attentively.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<3710.44;3713.64;en>>
Thank you very much Mr. Tallódi.

<<3713.64;3717.8;en>>
I thank both parties for their submissions.

<<3717.8;3727.24;en>>
Now I invite my colleagues, judges of the Grand Chamber, to put to the parties the questions they may have.

<<3727.24;3727.24;en>>
Judge López Guerra please.

[[Judge;Luis López Guerra]]

<<3729.87;3738.87;en>>
Yeah, just two brief questions, mainly to the government concerning the status of civil servants in Hungary.

<<3738.87;3764.19;en>>
The first one, do the professional civil servants are recruited, hired freely by the government or by the authorities, or they must pass some kind of a competitive process of selections by means of examinations or other ways of appraising the merit and value?

<<3764.19;3767.71;en>>
And the second question refers to this missile.

<<3767.71;3772.91;en>>
Do the professional civil servants have tenure?

<<3772.91;3791.71;en>>
That is to say, they have the expectation of employment stability for their active life unless there are specific reasons for this missile, or they are considering this missile in the same circumstances as the employees in the private sector applying the general labor law.

<<3791.71;3792.71;en>>
These are my two questions.

<<3792.71;3793.71;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<3794.07;3798.07;en>>
Thank you very much. Judge Koskelo, please.

[[Judge;Pauliine Koskelo]]

<<3801.11;3803.55;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<3803.55;3807.51;en>>
I would like to ask the following two questions.

<<3807.51;3815.97;en>>
I understand that these questions are addressed to both parties.

<<3815.97;3835.47;en>>
I understand that the applicant was eligible for early retirement because he had, at the age of 47, completed 30 years of service.

<<3835.47;3851.53;en>>
If this was the case, was the same regime of early retirement also applicable to employees in the private sector?

<<3851.53;3857.99;en>>
Or was this only applicable to those who worked in the public sector?

<<3857.99;3880.75;en>>
Or was it perhaps so that certain categories of employees in the private sector only were entitled to the same kind of early retirement on the basis of completion of 30 years of service?

<<3880.75;3887.63;en>>
The second question I would like to ask is the following.

<<3887.63;3910.19;en>>
For the applicant, the disbursements of his pension payments were suspended on the 1st of July 2013 and onwards because of the employment status that he had at that point in time.

<<3910.19;3918.31;en>>
What would have happened if he had subsequently moved to be employed in the private sector?

<<3918.31;3932.87;en>>
Would the pension payments have been resumed if he had began to work in the private sector instead after the 1st of July 2013?

<<3932.87;3932.87;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<3934.0;3935.0;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<3935.0;3936.0;en>>
Dirty Vehabović, please.

<<3936.0;3936.0;en>>
Thank you.

[[Judge;Faris Vehabović]]

<<3939.52;3942.96;en>>
Thank you. Just one simple question.

<<3943.64;3967.56;en>>
If the applicant, as an early retired person, pays additional contribution to the pension fund during his work in civil service, will he at the end receive a higher pension due to that additional contribution to the pension fund?

<<3967.56;3968.92;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<3969.04;3970.64;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<3970.64;3971.64;en>>
Judge O'Leary, please.

[[Judge;Síofra O’Leary]]

<<3973.98;3974.98;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<3974.98;3979.94;en>>
My questions complement those of Judge Koskelo and Judge Vehabović.

<<3979.94;3984.86;en>>
The government has informed us that the applicant was the beneficiary of an early retirement scheme.

<<3984.86;3991.66;en>>
But as such, was he entitled to retire at the age of 47, or was he obliged to do so?

<<3991.66;4004.26;en>>
And if he wasn't obliged to do so, does that mean that he could have continued to work until the statutory retirement age, which I understand was approximately 62 years and six months?

<<4004.26;4007.98;en>>
The next question relates to the question asked by Judge Vehabović.

<<4007.98;4023.74;en>>
I'd like you to clarify, I understood the respondent government's submissions as being that neither the applicant as an employee nor his public sector employer made any additional contributions which led to this entitlement to an early retirement pension.

<<4023.74;4044.66;en>>
If, in response to Judge Koskelo's question, it transpired that private sector employees could also benefit from early retirement, I'd like you to clarify whether a private sector employee or a private sector employer would have to make additional contributions in order to cover the longer disbursement of the pension.

<<4044.66;4052.36;en>>
My third question is purely factual, but as some people have already indicated, there are some factual omissions in the file.

<<4052.36;4064.1;en>>
The applicant retired from his first public sector job in the year 2000, and then we're informed that he began working again in the public sector in 2012, if I'm not mistaken.

<<4064.1;4067.26;en>>
Did he work between 2000 and 2012?

<<4067.26;4069.56;en>>
And if so, in which sector?

<<4069.56;4072.9;en>>
And finally, my fourth question is a more general one.

<<4072.9;4089.7;en>>
In its decision in a case called E.B. against Hungary, decided in 2013, this court has already examined the two mandatory pillars of the Hungarian pension system, which were established in 1998 with the second pillar abolished in 2010.

<<4089.7;4098.54;en>>
My question is, does this reform of the pension system and the change in its structure and organization have any relevance in the present case?

<<4098.54;4098.54;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4099.32;4102.36;en>>
Thank you very much. Now Judge Grozev, please.

[[Judge;Yonko Grozev]]

<<4108.93;4116.53;en>>
My question is with respect to both parties, and it is a follow-up on questions that have already been asked.

<<4116.53;4139.85;en>>
And it is, could you clarify the type of contributions given to the pensions fund by the applicant and his employer prior to 2000, when he became eligible to early retirement, and compare them to someone situated in a similar position in the private sector?

<<4139.85;4139.85;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4140.76;4141.96;en>>
Thank you very much, judge Turković.

[[Judge;Ksenija Turković]]

<<4145.81;4156.93;en>>
I would just like to follow up to the question by Judge Koskelo when she asked what would happen if he would move from the public sector to the private sector.

<<4156.93;4170.01;en>>
And for me it's interesting also what would happen with the person who worked prior to the private sector and then started to work in the private sector after this early retirement and then would move to the public sector.

<<4170.01;4175.53;en>>
Would the person then lose the pension?

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4176.95;4177.61;en>>
Thank you.

<<4177.61;4178.45;en>>
Judge Griţco, please.

[[Judge;Valeriu Griţco]]

<<4180.65;4181.69;en>>
Thank you.

<<4181.69;4184.21;en>>
I have a question to the government.

<<4184.21;4216.01;en>>
So I'd like to know if there is a policy in Hungary in order to assure a fair balance between generations in the public as well as in the private sector, in particular with the aim to promote better access to employment by means of a better distribution of work between the generations, and to regulate the labor market, in particular for the purposes of Urban unemployment.

<<4216.01;4216.01;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4217.32;4220.36;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4220.36;4221.36;en>>
Judge Sajó, please.

[[Judge;András Sajó]]

<<4225.63;4229.23;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4229.23;4252.91;en>>
In order to have very clear information on a matter that was already asked twice, could the applicant inform us what was the basis, the legal basis of early retirement, because there are so many, or there were so many under Hungarian law?

<<4252.91;4277.07;en>>
Second, do I understand correctly the government that there are possibilities to be employed in the public sector on part-time basis, even if someone is pensioner, and to keep the pension benefits at the same time?

<<4277.07;4301.07;en>>
As well as, is it possible to have a legal relationship in the public sector under other forms of, under other laws, namely under the civil code, under mandate, or undertaking?

<<4301.07;4321.71;en>>
And I ask this because the applicant claimed that there is a number of employees whose status is not explained, who receive pension benefit and are employed.

<<4321.71;4339.15;en>>
And we don't know the reason, other than for the health sector, why, what is the legal basis of they being in the public sector, although they are in pension?

<<4339.15;4367.43;en>>
And finally, do I understand correctly that between 2007 and the 2013 June change, the applicant did contribute to the pension fund, or was his salary exempt of pension contribution in that period?

<<4367.43;4367.43;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4367.73;4371.33;en>>
Thank you very much. There are no more questions.

<<4371.33;4388.93;en>>
The court will now rise for, say, 30 minutes, so we will resume at 5 to 11, following which the parties will return for a second round of short pleadings to respond to the submissions in the first round and to the judges' questions.

<<4388.93;4389.93;en>>
The hearing is now suspended.

[[Announcer;UNK]]

<<5973.37;5973.97;fr>>
La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<6016.28;6019.28;en>>
Please be seated.

<<6019.28;6023.36;en>>
The hearing is now resumed.

<<6023.36;6025.68;en>>
And I call Mr. Grád, please.

<<6025.68;6025.68;en>>
Thank you.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<6030.48;6037.48;en>>
Mr. President, Honorable Members of the Court, we tried to do our best to reply to all questions

<<6037.48;6043.08;en>>
that were lodged. However, I am not sure we will have time to answer all of them. I will

<<6043.08;6046.95;en>>
try to do it as briefly as I can.

<<6046.95;6063.88;en>>
As to the questions of Judge López Guerra, there is no compulsory competition as a general rule in Hungary. There are generally interviews instead, which are not the same.

<<6063.88;6090.68;en>>
As to his second question, there was a time when there was reasonable career security for civil servants, but it was changed without giving reasons for which this Court found violating the Convention in judgment KMC versus Hungary. Accordingly, that has been found

<<6090.68;6094.28;en>>
a violation of the Convention.

<<6094.28;6108.52;en>>
As to the questions of Judge Costello, there was a possibility in the private sector for that what she was asking. The second question, if someone moves to the private sector, the

<<6108.52;6116.16;en>>
disbursement of his or her pension automatically resumes.

<<6116.16;6129.91;en>>
As to the questions of Judge O'Leary, first, early retirement is optional, both in public and private sector. Second question, additional contribution is to be paid, both in private

<<6129.91;6132.32;en>>
and public sector.

<<6132.32;6150.64;en>>
In 2003, the applicant worked almost his entire life in the public sector, but between 2000 and 2012. Originally, the applicant worked as a professional police officer. However,

<<6150.64;6169.36;en>>
after early retirement, between 2000 and 2012, he worked in the private sector and he paid also contribution as a private sector employee to the pension fund.

<<6169.36;6186.91;en>>
Question four, there is no relevance whatsoever of the legal reform of 1998 in the present case, and I would note that not even the government themselves has insofar alleged somewhat like that.

<<6186.91;6203.16;en>>
As to the question of Judge Turkovic, yes, his pension would be immediately suspended, I mean the applicant's pension, would be immediately suspended in case of his moving to the private sector.

<<6203.16;6220.72;en>>
As to the questions of Mr. Sajó.

<<6220.72;6230.84;en>>
Thank you.

[[Judge;András Sajó]]

<<6238.52;6256.44;en>>
Do we understand correctly what you said, that in case the person goes to the private sector, his pension will be suspended? Is his pension suspended in case he works in the private sector?

<<6257.48;6263.72;en>>
You said it is suspended in case he returns to the private sector. Is this the case?

<<6263.72;6263.72;en>>
Yes.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<6264.5;6274.54;en>>
Probably that was a misunderstanding. Whenever someone employed in the private sector

<<6274.54;6281.86;en>>
starts working in the public sector, immediately and automatically loses his right to the pension.

<<6281.86;6287.76;en>>
And vice versa is the same if someone from the public sector goes to the private sector.

<<6287.76;6294.76;en>>
He or she has the right again to have his pension and it will not be suspended anymore.

[[Judge;Guido Raimondi]]

<<6297.59;6297.87;en>>
Thank you.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<6300.43;6313.67;en>>
I would also note that, unfortunately, maybe there were some misunderstandings in respect of our submissions.

<<6313.67;6315.75;en>>
I apologize for that.

<<6315.75;6326.51;en>>
And if our submissions concerning the abolishment of the pension ceiling was unclear, I would clarify it.

<<6326.51;6339.07;en>>
To be clear, the ceiling on pension contribution was quashed, but it resulted in the quashing of the de facto ceiling of top amount pensions as well.

<<6339.07;6352.63;en>>
The reason thereof was that before the abolishment of the ceiling, the pension fund did not pay higher amount to the particular persons that could be calculated on the maximum contribution.

<<6352.63;6361.99;en>>
Since the maximum is not capped anymore, logically, the pensions can go higher.

<<6361.99;6375.31;en>>
I would also briefly reflect on what the respected government agent was telling to the court on this hearing.

<<6375.31;6384.43;en>>
First of all, I would note that section 83.3 of the present

<<6384.43;6394.39;en>>
legal regulation at issue was introduced in order to ensure a more fair distribution of funds.

<<6394.39;6396.71;en>>
That was what he told us.

<<6396.71;6400.23;en>>
In fact, it is unfortunately not true at all.

<<6400.23;6413.27;en>>
In fact, this section, 83.3, caused a very strict injustice

<<6413.27;6441.59;en>>
in that respect in distribution of pensions, as insofar the government still has not given any proper reason why, for instance, health care employees should receive their entire pension, whilst other pensioners continuing working in the public sphere are not able to do that.

<<6441.59;6452.99;en>>
So this regulation is anything but fair and anything but serving the fair distribution of the public funds.

<<6452.99;6461.55;en>>
If I understood it correctly, the government stated that only elected persons are concerned.

<<6461.55;6472.19;en>>
However, in their appendix to the report prepared by the Ministry of Justice, it is perfectly clear that not just elected persons are concerned.

<<6472.19;6478.59;en>>
A number of other persons, public officers, and so on, who have never, ever been elected, are also concerned.

<<6478.59;6489.83;en>>
It was mentioned also by the government that Mr. Fabian was an early pension retirement person.

<<6489.83;6494.91;en>>
I think that actually it has nothing to do with the present case.

<<6494.91;6500.35;en>>
He was supposed to be an early pension retiree.

<<6500.35;6505.95;en>>
He was supposed to be a pensioner who had been working in the public sphere for a long time.

<<6505.95;6516.79;en>>
He was supposed to be an early retirement person due to the acts and the legal regulations of Hungary at that relevant time.

<<6516.79;6520.31;en>>
He is not responsible for the legal regulations.

<<6520.31;6524.91;en>>
He was allowed to have an early retirement due to the legal regulations of Hungary.

<<6524.91;6526.83;en>>
It is not his fault.

<<6526.83;6534.79;en>>
And actually, he continued working in the private sphere, paid contributions to the pension fund.

<<6534.79;6544.83;en>>
Accordingly, I don't think that the government could adequately rely on the lack of contributions on behalf of my client in that respect.

<<6549.43;6565.91;en>>
And I do not think that the applicant has ever been in a similar or analogous situation as all other types of public servants mentioned by the government.

<<6565.91;6575.91;en>>
Actually, this problem can be raised between any different individuals.

<<6575.91;6579.87;en>>
There are no two identical individuals as such.

<<6579.87;6589.55;en>>
However, it does not create an objective and reasonable justification of such a distinction.

<<6589.55;6592.63;en>>
Mr. President, honorable members of the court,

<<6592.63;6593.59;en>>
thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<6594.03;6598.03;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Grad. I call Mr. Tallódi, please.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<6599.83;6603.13;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<6603.13;6609.93;en>>
We would like to answer the questions by topics.

<<6609.93;6622.89;en>>
The questions concerning the status of civil servants, we would like to add that there are several categories of civil servants in Hungary, all with different set of rights and obligations.

<<6622.89;6627.99;en>>
As regards recruitment, the practice differs by each employer.

<<6627.99;6635.33;en>>
Generally, there is a public call for competition, but there may be exemptions.

<<6635.33;6653.29;en>>
As regards dismissal, their common feature is that they are less easily dismissed, and they still have a very good chance of winning a court action in case of their dismissal for its unlawfulness.

<<6653.29;6671.49;en>>
Concerning the early retirement schemes, we would like to add that the applicant earned his entitlement to service pension in public service, which was naturally available only in public service.

<<6671.49;6688.85;en>>
There were also grounds for early retirement for certain occupations originating in the communist era when everything was public sector and becoming private sector only after 1990.

<<6688.85;6696.83;en>>
These grounds were abolished in 1997, with the effect from 2001.

<<6696.83;6702.09;en>>
No additional contributions were paid by these groups and the employer either.

<<6702.09;6724.25;en>>
Here, I would also like to refer to my presentation to the effect that employment and social policy intermingled to a great extent in the regulation of pension benefits to the detriment of the contributory nature of the pension system.

<<6724.25;6740.59;en>>
Concerning the aims of the measures in terms of intergenerational justice, I would like to add that the measure complained of had complex aims and purposes.

<<6740.59;6751.25;en>>
One of them was to encourage retirement of old-age pensions from public service and give way to employment of younger generation.

<<6751.25;6770.49;en>>
There has indeed been an increase of employment of younger people in the public sector, but having regard to the complexity of the phenomenon, the government cannot conclude with certainty that it has a strong correlation with the measure complained of.

<<6770.49;6788.85;en>>
I also would like to add that the applicant was not obliged to retire at the age of 47, and the payment of pension contributions after work as a pensioner was not dependent upon the public or private nature of the employer.

<<6788.85;6799.53;en>>
The applicant was not obliged to and didn't pay pension contributions between 2001 and 2007.

<<6799.53;6818.53;en>>
After 2007, he paid preferential rate pension contributions, changing continuously, and received the corresponding increase of his pension in accordance with Section 22A of the Pension Act.

<<6818.53;6831.13;en>>
As to the employment of pensioners in the public sector in part-time employment, I submit that it is not excluded by law, but it is not typical.

<<6831.13;6847.13;en>>
The proportion of employees in public service who can be employed under the rules of the labor code is limited by law to 10% of the staff and to posts not related to the exercise of public powers.

<<6847.13;6859.93;en>>
These employees do not enjoy the same protection in case of dismissal and are not subject to the rules of ethics applicable to civil servants, since they are not civil servants.

<<6859.93;6868.13;en>>
Part-time work is very rare in Hungary, and it is so also in the public sector as well.

<<6868.13;6886.77;en>>
Under the labor code, employees can be lawfully dismissed when they are already entitled to receive pension, and thus the employment policy aims of the measure complained of are not relevant to this group.

<<6886.77;6905.21;en>>
The question concerning what would have happened if the applicant moved to the private sector, the answer is that the disbursement of his pension would have been resumed as soon as he informed the pension authority.

<<6905.21;6926.33;en>>
As old-age pensioner, although underage, but legally qualifying as old-age pensioner for purposes of Section 83B of the Pension Act, he would not be subject to an income ceiling.

<<6926.33;6932.73;en>>
Other early retirement pensioners are subject to that ceiling in both the private and the public sector.

<<6932.73;6939.61;en>>
These distinctions are justified by complex aims of employment and social policy.

<<6942.61;6957.45;en>>
Finally, I note that the abolishment of compulsory private pension element of the pension system examined in AB versus Hungary isn't relevant in the present case.

<<6957.45;6964.77;en>>
It was the case of Markovic and others versus Hungary which raised more similar items.

<<6964.77;6976.65;en>>
Lastly, only one short comment concerning the government report which was submitted by the applicant as evidence.

<<6976.65;6986.45;en>>
And we know that this confidential material doesn't reflect the position of the government because this document wasn't adopted by the government.

<<6986.45;6996.85;en>>
It was prepared for the government reflecting some experts' opinions so none of its statements can be taken on its face value.

<<6996.85;6998.77;en>>
Thank you very much for your kind attention.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<6999.57;7006.57;en>>

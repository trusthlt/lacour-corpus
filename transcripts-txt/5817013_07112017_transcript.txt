La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<76.8;86.72;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the admissibility and merits in the case of Big Brother Watch and others versus the United Kingdom.

<<86.72;112.98;en>>
The three applications were lodged with the court under Article 34 of the Convention by Big Brother Watch and others, Bureau of Investigative Journalism and Alice Ross, and 10 human rights organizations and others on 4 September 2013, 11 September 2014, and 20 May 2015, respectively.

<<112.98;123.22;en>>
The applications were allocated to the first section of the court pursuant to Rule 52, Paragraph 1 of the Rules of Court.

<<123.22;138.02;en>>
The applications were communicated to the government on 7 January 2014, 5 January 2015, and 24 November 2015, respectively.

<<138.02;162.46;en>>
The respondent government are represented by their agent, Mrs. Sagoo, assisted by Mr. Eadie QC and Mr. Milford, Counsel, and my Mrs. Samuel, Mr. Bowden, Mr. Anstee, Mr. Rutherford, Mrs. Morgan, and Mr. Newman, advisors.

<<162.46;187.22;en>>
The applicants are represented by Mrs. Rose QC, Mrs. Mountfield QC, and Mr. Ryder QC, counsel, assisted by Mr. Mehta, Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Wills, Mr. Carey, Mrs. Wilson Palow, and Mr. Williams, advisors.

<<187.22;192.52;en>>
Additional representatives from the applicant organizations are also present.

<<192.52;196.82;en>>
I welcome the representatives in the name of the court.

<<196.82;202.9;en>>
I also welcome the delegation from the Indonesian Constitutional Court.

<<202.9;212.26;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and the representative of the applicants, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<212.26;221.54;en>>
Mr. Eadie for the government will speak first, and then Mrs. Rose and Mrs. Mountfield for the applicants.

<<221.54;222.54;en>>
Mr. Eadie, you have the floor.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<226.4;228.92;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<228.92;236.22;en>>
these applications raise issues of the utmost importance for the United Kingdom.

<<236.22;253.18;en>>
If the applicant's case on the legal requirements for interception and intelligence sharing in this context were to be accepted, the results would be profound damage to the capabilities and work of the UK intelligence services.

<<253.18;275.96;en>>
The nature of the safeguards against unwarranted intrusion on the right to proper respect for privacy need, we say, to take into account the impact on the ability of the government to protect the lives and safety of the public, all the more so in the light of the string of recent and appalling atrocities across Europe.

<<275.96;298.4;en>>
That balance, that sensitivity to the need not unduly to impede contracting states' ability to fulfill their paradigm-protective responsibilities, is inherent in the fundamental structure of the Convention and has been a hallmark of this court's jurisprudence in this area, and rightly so.

<<298.4;305.24;en>>
I will need to examine the true extent of the interference with Article 8 rights in the present context in due course.

<<305.24;314.24;en>>
And I will, of course, examine in some detail the extensive, multilayered systems of safeguarding that exist in the UK.

<<314.24;329.68;en>>
But it is to be noted at the outset, when considering these balances, that whilst privacy rights are, of course, of importance and to be respected, the right to life and, indeed, the safety of citizens is paramount.

<<329.68;336.12;en>>
And in this sphere, as you will be well aware, national security is not an end in itself.

<<336.12;344.76;en>>
The intelligence services exist and operate to seek, as best they can in a dangerous world, to protect the public.

<<344.76;350.36;en>>
The scales in the overall balance are not evenly weighed.

<<350.36;364.92;en>>
The core problem at the heart of the applicants' case is that they seek to conjure up, by reference to what we suggest are grossly inaccurate speculations presented as fact, a specter of vast privacy intrusion.

<<364.92;375.92;en>>
They ignore or seek to downplay the wide-ranging safeguarding built into the domestic regime and then simply ignore the critical need to protect lives.

<<375.92;385.88;en>>
I, therefore, start with the pressing need for and critical importance of the intelligence services capabilities that you are considering today.

<<385.88;419.56;en>>
The importance of those powers has been the subject of detailed and repeated consideration by a series of independent bodies in recent years, by the independent reviewer of terrorism, David Anderson QC, whose report is at tab 50 of your bundle, by the Intelligence and Security Committee in Parliament, whose report, in relevant part, is at tab 47 of your bundle, by the Interception Commissioner, and by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, the IPT.

<<419.56;422.52;en>>
There is unanimity of view.

<<422.52;430.52;en>>
There is, to use Anderson's words, a proven operational case emphasising the importance of the powers.

<<430.52;436.16;en>>
As he put it at paragraph 5.54 of the bulk powers report,

<<436.16;447.84;en>>
bulk interception is proven and is of, quote, vital utility in counterterrorism and in protecting against child exploitation, amongst other fields.

<<447.84;460.52;en>>
It has played, as he put it, an important part in the prevention of bomb attacks and is of very great utility in assessing the intentions and plans of targets in crucial situations.

<<460.52;467.08;en>>
And it has, as he noted, no proper, less intrusive alternative.

<<467.08;480.32;en>>
We have given compelling examples of major threats that were only discovered and repelled by the use of bulk data at paragraphs 23 to 27 of our observations.

<<480.32;496.16;en>>
They include the triggering of a manhunt for a known terrorist linked to previous attacks on the UK at a time when other intelligence sources had gone cold, and the highlighting of links between the terrorist and extremists in the UK.

<<496.16;501.4;en>>
The result was a successful disruption of the terrorist network.

<<501.4;512.28;en>>
The identification of an airline worker with links to al-Qaeda, who had offered to use his airport access to launch a terrorist attack from the United Kingdom.

<<512.28;520.28;en>>
Without access to bulk data and its examination, it is highly unlikely that he would have been identified.

<<520.28;528.32;en>>
The analysis of bulk data to track men overseas who had used the World Wide Web to blackmail hundreds of children across the world.

<<528.32;535.36;en>>
The disruption of an operational terrorist cell in the final hours before a planned attack.

<<535.36;554.2;en>>
Most recently, in a judgment of the 8th of September, 2017, behind tab 21 of your bundles, the IPT, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, has referred a series of questions back to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg post the Watson decision.

<<554.2;567.88;en>>
In relevant part, they questioned whether the sorts of safeguards identified in Watson and Digital Rights Ireland could possibly work in the national security context that we are dealing with here.

<<567.88;579.96;en>>
The IPT was concerned, therefore, to set out as clearly as possible the true factual basis on which those issues arose in the context of the bulk capabilities of the intelligence agencies.

<<579.96;589.96;en>>
They were concerned to do so in part, given inaccurate and overblown assertions made by claimants who were unsighted on the true facts.

<<589.96;605.52;en>>
In part, recognizing that the IPT had the benefit themselves of having seen the full picture, including sensitive material, and in part concerned that the CJU may not fully and clearly have understood the relevant facts.

<<605.52;614.6;en>>
They placed considerable reliance on the independent Anderson report, but they also considered further and updating evidence.

<<614.6;617.76;en>>
They then made three important findings of fact.

<<617.76;631.44;en>>
First, that the use of bulk data capabilities is, quote, critical to the ability of the security and intelligence agencies to secure national security and essential to the protection of that national security.

<<631.44;640.8;en>>
Second, a fundamental feature they found of many of the techniques of interrogating bulk data is that they are non-targeted.

<<640.8;650.4;en>>
As they noted, the capacity to intercept communications in bulk is critical for the discovery of threats and intelligence targets.

<<650.4;663.16;en>>
The intelligence services rely on the use of small pieces of intelligence information obtained through bulk interception in order to find new threats and those responsible for them.

<<663.16;674.48;en>>
As the Intelligence and Security Committee said in their 2014 report, quote, it is essential that the agencies can discover unknown threats.

<<674.48;679.52;en>>
This is not just about identifying individuals who are responsible for threats.

<<679.52;683.32;en>>
It is about finding those threats in the first place.

<<683.32;707.48;en>>
Indeed, often this is the only way to obtain even a small proportion of the communications of known targets overseas in circumstances where they are very likely to use a variety of means of communication and change those means frequently and where electronic communications travel over a variety of different routes to reach their intended destination.

<<707.48;717.52;en>>
As the IPT pointed out, this is very different from the use of data in an investigation of a criminal offence by police.

<<717.52;725.76;en>>
The police may well have identified a suspect who can then be made the subject of a targeted investigation.

<<725.76;735.24;en>>
There is, as the IPT put it, a, and I quote, a need for the haystack in order to find the needle.

<<735.24;757.44;en>>
The IPT gave an example of how it had been possible to use bulk data in this way to establish by applying a number of filters and matches to reduce a pool of some 27,000 candidates so that one person was identified as a suspected al-Qaeda suicide bomber.

<<757.44;771.84;en>>
The IPT thus concluded that bulk communications data, quote, is of particular value in identifying potential threats by persons who are not the target of any investigation.

<<771.84;774.84;en>>
Their third finding was this.

<<774.84;802.84;en>>
If in a national security context such as the present, procedural requirements of the kind referred to by the CJU in Watson were to be applied to measures taken in the bulk data sphere to protect national security, and I quote from the IPT's judgment at paragraph 69, they would frustrate them and put the national security of the UK and it may be other member states at risk.

<<802.84;807.24;en>>
I emphasise that those findings of fact were made two months ago.

<<807.24;815.84;en>>
I do so because the applicants say at paragraphs 9 to 15 of their observations that in this sphere, the world has moved on.

<<815.84;818.8;en>>
In truth, the fundamentals of the section 8.4

<<818.8;821.36;en>>
interception regime have not changed.

<<821.36;828.76;en>>
It was known at the time that the relevant piece of legislation, RIPA, was enacted that a section 8.4 warrant would be used

<<828.76;843.56;en>>
to collect external communications in bulk, that this would require the interception of the entire contents of a bearer and that a certain number of internal communications would necessarily be intercepted as part of that process.

<<843.56;850.64;en>>
All those matters are reflected in debate in Parliament over the bill and in the scheme of the Act.

<<850.64;858.08;en>>
The volume of communications has inevitably increased, but those fundamentals remain exactly the same.

<<858.08;873.16;en>>
The really significant change is that the task of collecting wanted and necessary data is now much more complex, whilst at the same time, the global threat of terrorism has hugely increased.

<<873.16;880.28;en>>
Terrorists and criminals use online methods of communication that are much more difficult today to intercept.

<<880.28;883.24;en>>
They are much more aware of data security.

<<883.24;886.64;en>>
They hide behind multiple and changing identities online.

<<886.64;888.56;en>>
They hide in the dark web.

<<888.56;890.8;en>>
They use encryption.

<<890.8;897.48;en>>
And the number of communication providers has grown, and their levels of cooperation vary significantly.

<<897.48;911.36;en>>
And the amount of online data through which the intelligence services must sift to find the sorts of communications that are vital to enable the public to be protected has multiplied exponentially.

<<911.36;918.88;en>>
So the capabilities that are the subject of this application are absolutely vital.

<<918.88;929.24;en>>
Before turning to the extensive safeguards that are in place, it is important to spend a little time on the true extent of any interference with Article 8 rights.

<<929.24;938.44;en>>
That is important because the applicants bring, in this case, on a premise about what bulk interception entails, which is simply false.

<<938.44;945.04;en>>
The true operation of the bulk interception regime is as follows.

<<945.04;955.28;en>>
First, in order to obtain any wanted communications at all flowing through a communications bearer, it is necessary to intercept its entire contents.

<<955.28;963.08;en>>
Without bulk interception, it would not be technically possible to obtain any information from the bearer in the first place.

<<963.08;970.76;en>>
Secondly, only those bearers that are the subject of an interception warrant can be and are accessed.

<<970.76;982.36;en>>
Under the code that is in place in the United Kingdom, the bearers chosen must be those most likely to carry external communications meeting the descriptions of materials certified by the Secretary of State.

<<982.36;988.64;en>>
For instance, bearers carrying a high proportion of communications from northern Syria.

<<988.64;998.68;en>>
Under the code, highly detailed information is required for any warrant application, explaining why it is necessary and proportionate for statutory purposes.

<<998.68;1002.2;en>>
Those applications are subject to the oversight of the Commissioner.

<<1002.2;1005.0;en>>
He examines the paperwork for a high proportion of these.

<<1005.0;1007.68;en>>
They are not rolling warrants.

<<1007.68;1014.6;en>>
They must be regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain necessary and their renewal must be justified.

<<1014.6;1026.6;en>>
Thirdly, only a tiny proportion of communications so intercepted can be and are ever selected and retained for possible examination.

<<1026.6;1034.8;en>>
They are subjected to automated searches in near real time for strong selectors, for instance, a known terrorist phone number.

<<1034.8;1046.4;en>>
A limited proportion are also subject to more complex queries, for instance, access to known extremist material together with use of particular language associated with terrorism.

<<1046.4;1054.76;en>>
In each case, just the communications so selected are retained and all other communications are discarded.

<<1054.76;1069.2;en>>
In response, therefore, to paragraph 25 of the applicant's obligations, the chance that innocent communications between a group of friends in London arranging a meeting could be selected or retained on this basis is nil.

<<1069.2;1081.84;en>>
Moreover, it is only here when a communication is pulled from the amorphous soup of data collected from a bearer that there is in truth any meaningful interference with an individual's privacy rights.

<<1081.84;1092.0;en>>
The overwhelming majority of communications flowing over a relevant bearer are filtered and discarded before there is any possibility that they could ever be looked at.

<<1092.0;1101.68;en>>
The fact that an individual's data may form part of the discarded soup is not a reason to consider that his article 8 rights have been substantially infringed.

<<1101.68;1116.12;en>>
As the commissioner put it in his 2013 report, in the real world, intrusion in this context into the privacy of innocent persons would require sentient examination of individuals' communications.

<<1116.12;1122.72;en>>
That's tab 35 of your bundles, paragraph 6.63.

<<1122.72;1129.48;en>>
Fourthly, only a tiny proportion even of this retained material is ever examined.

<<1129.48;1134.88;en>>
And when that occurs, it requires a good and sufficient justification for doing so.

<<1134.88;1146.36;en>>
An analyst who wishes to examine any selected communication must record why such examination is necessary and proportionate for the purposes in the Secretary of State's certificate.

<<1146.36;1152.72;en>>
And under the Code, those auditable records are subject to oversight by the commissioner.

<<1152.72;1168.6;en>>
Finally, communications selected for examination and related communications data can only be retained for a limited period, in most cases a maximum of two years, and should, so far as possible, be automatically deleted at the end of that period.

<<1168.6;1173.36;en>>
This, again, is written into the Code and is overseen by the commissioner.

<<1173.36;1185.36;en>>
So the spectre that the applicants seek to create of a mass of untrammelled intrusion is just that, we submit, a spectre.

<<1185.36;1187.96;en>>
What then of the safeguards?

<<1187.96;1203.76;en>>
My submission is that the safeguarding regime is extensive, multilayered, and fully meets the Convention requirements for all of the reasons given by the IPT in their careful judgment in the Liberty Privacy case.

<<1203.76;1206.88;en>>
The judgment is behind tab 14 in your bundles.

<<1206.88;1215.64;en>>
They properly understood the Convention jurisprudence and its relevant requirements for protection against arbitrary or abusive conduct.

<<1215.64;1226.32;en>>
Their conclusion was that the system in its essentials was in accordance with law and proportionate, and in accordance with all of Articles 8, 10, and 14.

<<1226.32;1233.12;en>>
What follows is a summary of the main aspects of the safeguarding regime, and given time, no more than that.

<<1233.12;1237.12;en>>
Perhaps two initial points at the outset of considering safeguards.

<<1237.12;1248.12;en>>
First, the applicants paint these applications as the latest in what they claim is a long line of cases about the UK's failure to give effect to privacy rights.

<<1248.12;1252.8;en>>
That is, with respect, a wholesale mischaracterization.

<<1252.8;1263.16;en>>
The reason why RIPA was enacted in the first place was precisely to ensure that the UK's domestic law complied with Convention rights.

<<1263.16;1276.2;en>>
The interception cases concerning the UK, which the applicants cite at paragraph 19 of their observations, are all cases about the legal regimes predating RIPA.

<<1276.2;1292.32;en>>
That includes the Liberty case from 2009, which concerned the UK's former bulk surveillance regime under the Interception of Communications Act 1985, when there was no code setting out safeguards on the use of statutory interception powers.

<<1292.32;1295.44;en>>
The position, of course, has moved on since.

<<1295.44;1319.8;en>>
Not only is the entirety of the code in the public domain setting out detailed safeguards for every stage of the operation of the Section 8-4 regime, from the application for a warrant all the way through to destruction of records, but the code was also extensively revised in January 2016 to strengthen and update those safeguards.

<<1319.8;1328.96;en>>
In fact, this Court has considered the adequacy of RIPA and the 2002 version of the code, at least, in considerable detail.

<<1328.96;1342.32;en>>
It did so in Kennedy and the United Kingdom, where it confirmed that the regime for targeted interception of communications under Section 8-1 of RIPA was compatible with Article 8.

<<1342.32;1365.88;en>>
It is true, of course, that the regime under consideration in Kennedy did not concern bulk powers, but the Court's observations about the significance of the code and the safeguards provided by the Intelligence and Security Committee in Parliament, the Commissioner, and the IPT, the Tribunal, remain just as important to these applications as they were in Kennedy itself.

<<1365.88;1379.76;en>>
Nor, and this is the second initial point, is it relevant, as the applicants do, to compare the detailed content of the UK's legal regime with the so-called G10 regime at issue in the Weber case.

<<1379.76;1394.72;en>>
In Weber, the Court found that the two-stage process under which wireless communications were intercepted in bulk and then subject to searching using relevant catchwords was compliant with Article 8.

<<1394.72;1400.24;en>>
That two-stage process is also how the Section 8-4 regime operates.

<<1400.24;1413.12;en>>
The test, therefore, is not, we suggest, whether in one or more respects the Section 8-4 regime is less tightly defined than the German strategic monitoring regime at issue in Weber.

<<1413.12;1427.08;en>>
Rather, the question is whether, taken as a whole, the Section 8-4 regime offers adequate safeguards against abuse and meets the general criteria for an interception regime set out at paragraph 95 of Weber.

<<1427.08;1430.76;en>>
And the answer to that question, we submit, is clearly yes.

<<1430.76;1452.4;en>>
The Section 8-4 regime, if I start with that, is contained in a combination of primary legislation, RIPA, published codes, in particular the 2016 code behind tab 33 of your bundle, and internal arrangements overseen by a specially appointed commissioner and ultimately the tribunal.

<<1452.4;1458.68;en>>
The bedrock of those regimes is the convention concepts of necessity and proportionality.

<<1458.68;1474.0;en>>
Those fundamental principles govern all aspects of information and intelligence, from obtaining it in the first place, to examining it, to handling, storing, and disclosing it, and finally to its retention and deletion.

<<1474.0;1480.88;en>>
It involves a requirement, backed in detail by the code, for warrants to be obtained from the Secretary of State.

<<1480.88;1485.52;en>>
Warrants are required to collect any data, including communications data.

<<1485.52;1497.68;en>>
It is, therefore, nonsense to suggest, as the applicants do at paragraph 115 of their observations, that, quote, no protection is offered at all for the collection of communications data.

<<1497.68;1511.56;en>>
The warrant process governs the collection of any data under that regime, and all the same safeguards under Section 15 of RIPA apply to communications data as they do to the content of communications.

<<1511.56;1522.2;en>>
The fact that Section 16 of RIPA does not apply to communications data does not leave the purposes for which it can be used and stored at large.

<<1522.2;1538.16;en>>
Communications data can only be accessed for the intelligence services' statutory purposes in the Security Service Act of 1989 and the Intelligence Services Act of 1994, and only then where necessary and proportionate.

<<1538.16;1549.64;en>>
Those statutory purposes are, to all intents and purposes, no wider than the purposes for which a warrant can be issued under Section 5, sub 3 of RIPA.

<<1549.64;1564.32;en>>
Moreover, it would not be possible for the constraints upon examination of the communications of persons known to be within the British Islands imposed by Section 16 of RIPA to apply to communications data as well as communications themselves.

<<1564.32;1572.96;en>>
In order to assess whether a person is within the British Isles in the first place, the intelligence services need to use communications data.

<<1572.96;1591.4;en>>
More fundamentally, perhaps, such constraints could not sensibly be imposed in the first place, because communications data are used, in particular, to discover as yet unknown threats without knowing who is responsible for them or where they are located.

<<1591.4;1606.24;en>>
The safeguards built into this regime include a comprehensive and effective system of oversight by the ISC, a parliamentary committee, the commissioner, a former law justice of appeal, and a specialist tribunal, the IPT.

<<1606.24;1609.6;en>>
And the IPT is of particular importance here.

<<1609.6;1618.64;en>>
In the liberty proceedings, the judgment is at tab 14 of your bundles, it examined in detail the very issues now raised in these applications.

<<1618.64;1623.72;en>>
It sat as a panel of five distinguished lawyers, including two high court judges.

<<1623.72;1628.32;en>>
It held open hearings, initially over five days.

<<1628.32;1633.0;en>>
It considered a very large quantity of evidence and submissions.

<<1633.0;1638.4;en>>
The applicants were represented by experienced teams of leading and junior counsel.

<<1638.4;1648.36;en>>
The IPT considered and applied articles 8, 10, and 14 of the convention and the convention jurisprudence relating to them.

<<1648.36;1661.12;en>>
It also conducted closed hearings in which it examined the actual systems and the actual practices and policies applied by the agencies in this context.

<<1661.12;1671.6;en>>
It was therefore able to get a complete and accurate picture of the true extent of the safeguarding regime and its operation in practice.

<<1671.6;1683.68;en>>
The IPT, for the purpose of those closed hearings from which necessarily the applicants were excluded, were assisted by leading and junior counsel acting as counsel to the tribunal.

<<1683.68;1688.52;en>>
That enabled a thorough and rigorous examination of matters in closed.

<<1688.52;1700.24;en>>
It included examination of the intelligence services internal arrangements for safeguarding privacy rights, which could not be disclosed for good reasons of national security.

<<1700.24;1705.74;en>>
What the IPT described in their judgment as the below the waterline arrangements.

<<1705.74;1716.92;en>>
The IPT ensured, however, that the disclosure of all those parts of them that it considered could safely be placed in the public domain were placed in the public domain.

<<1716.92;1730.24;en>>
But of course, some part of them unsurprisingly, and some part of the IPT's consideration of the safeguarding regime had to be closed in order to avoid the risk of damage to national security.

<<1730.24;1742.36;en>>
The applicants say that these arrangements are, as they put it at 102 of their observations, analogous to the undisclosed arrangements criticized by the court in Liberty and the UK.

<<1742.36;1748.4;en>>
That complaint, of course, entirely ignores the published code.

<<1748.4;1751.4;en>>
But the two key points are these.

<<1751.4;1765.96;en>>
First, the internal arrangements themselves provide a further and important safeguard against abusive or arbitrary action, as this court itself accepted in its Liberty judgment, C power 67.

<<1765.96;1771.84;en>>
They are the practices and policies that members of the agencies must follow.

<<1771.84;1789.64;en>>
Secondly, it is an equally important part of the safeguarding regime that the IPT is able to consider those arrangements with a view to assessing both their effectiveness as arrangements and how they are operated in practice.

<<1789.64;1795.84;en>>
The IPT did precisely that with counsel to the tribunal's assistance in the Liberty proceedings.

<<1795.84;1808.12;en>>
And that meant that the judgments that they made about the adequacy of the safeguarding regimes could be formed on the basis of a complete and accurate safeguarding picture.

<<1808.12;1818.84;en>>
So the ability to examine those matters necessarily enclosed is, we suggest, an important safeguarding virtue and not a vice.

<<1818.84;1835.12;en>>
The various limitations which the applicants contend should be now superimposed upon bulk interception are, we submit, both unnecessary and in some respects back to the balances I mentioned at the outset, positively and deeply damaging.

<<1835.12;1848.72;en>>
The requirement that they suggest for objective evidence of reasonable suspicion would in practice render bulk interception either impossible or largely ineffective.

<<1848.72;1861.92;en>>
It is unclear at what point they contend that such a requirement should be imposed, but if reasonable suspicion were required in relation to the entire product of interception, then bulk interception itself would be impossible.

<<1861.92;1867.32;en>>
That has never been suggested by this court and is directly contradicted by Weber.

<<1867.32;1885.04;en>>
Even a requirement of reasonable suspicion in relation to access to the intercepted material would emasculate the regime because, as I've explained, a primary purpose of the 8-4 regime is to identify threats and targets in the first place.

<<1885.04;1904.48;en>>
The suggestion that one could not investigate, for example, nuclear proliferation without knowing the identity of persons in the nuclear material supply chain would, we suggest, be extraordinary and highlights precisely the concern with an introduction of a requirement of that kind.

<<1904.48;1913.12;en>>
The requirement for prior judicial authorisation of interception warrants is not a requirement, we submit, of the court's case law.

<<1913.12;1920.52;en>>
This court has deliberately trodden a careful line on this issue and we submit it should continue to do so.

<<1920.52;1930.44;en>>
It has found that proper judicial oversight is required, but that such oversight may be either ex ante or ex post facto.

<<1930.44;1943.16;en>>
Given the strong independent and judicial safeguard provided by the IPT, the ability of any person to complain to the IPT at that ex post facto oversight is, we say, quite sufficient.

<<1943.16;1950.6;en>>
Indeed, its effectiveness is illustrated in the very proceedings from which this application comes.

<<1950.6;1958.96;en>>
Finally, a general requirement for subsequent notification is not required here either and would also be highly damaging.

<<1958.96;1967.96;en>>
The purpose of notification is to enable a person who suspects that his communications have been targeted to have access to an effective remedy.

<<1967.96;1978.72;en>>
That purpose is satisfied by the extremely wide jurisdiction of the IPT to examine a complaint of unlawful interception.

<<1978.72;1985.08;en>>
Whether or not the complainant has any evidence of interception in his case, see Kennedy 167.

<<1985.08;2003.04;en>>
A general requirement of notification would unnecessarily inform criminals or terrorists of the investigative techniques that the agencies use in the context of bulk interception, so would remain operationally damaging even if the particular investigation in question had ended.

<<2003.04;2037.72;en>>
It is in those circumstances unsurprising that in its CJU reference judgment recently, the IPT described any such requirement in a context such as this as being, paragraph 63 of that judgment, very damaging to national security and going on to note in any event at paragraph 64 that it would be, very difficult to know how a requirement to give notification should be interpreted in respect of the acquisition or use of a bulk database and how it could be practically implemented.

<<2037.72;2052.32;en>>
So there are, we submit, for all of those reasons, serious, multi-layered legal protections against arbitrary or abusive or unnecessary interference with the right to respect for privacy.

<<2052.32;2066.12;en>>
In practice, exactly the same safeguards apply equally to intercepted communications shared by the UK's intelligence partners of the type at issue in the other part of these applications.

<<2066.12;2083.12;en>>
The Secretary of State has never requested such material without a RIPA warrant already being in place, but when it is acquired, it must be treated on the same basis and according to the same safeguards applied to communications intercepted by the agencies themselves.

<<2083.12;2089.24;en>>
We see for that purpose chapter 12 of the 2016 code.

<<2089.24;2093.84;en>>
I make three short points about the applicant's case on intelligence sharing.

<<2093.84;2099.88;en>>
First, we submit that the Weber criteria cannot apply unmodified in this context.

<<2099.88;2106.2;en>>
The reason is not to do with the extent to which the sharing of foreign intelligence may interfere with privacy.

<<2106.2;2119.6;en>>
It is because there is no sensible basis upon which to distinguish intercept material from any other types of information that might in principle be obtained by a foreign intelligence agency.

<<2119.6;2130.36;en>>
And because the intelligence services will often not know how material provided to them by that foreign intelligence agency has been obtained, let alone have any control over it.

<<2130.36;2142.0;en>>
The Weber criteria are of course, but only appropriate for a regime in which the state receiving intelligence knows how it has been obtained and is able to control that method.

<<2142.0;2151.2;en>>
That's why they can sensibly be applied to covert surveillance of the kind addressed in RE and the United Kingdom.

<<2151.2;2155.84;en>>
That is not the case for the receipt of intelligence from foreign partners.

<<2155.84;2165.32;en>>
Secondly, the applicants mischaracterize the nature of the intelligence sharing regime because they ignore the existence of chapter 12 of the code.

<<2165.32;2168.52;en>>
That omission, it might be thought is most egregious.

<<2168.52;2170.52;en>>
That's at tab 33 of the code.

<<2170.52;2182.0;en>>
In the paragraphs of their observations headed basis in law, where they rely upon a statement from Anderson that there is quote, no code of practice governing how exchanges should be authorized.

<<2182.0;2191.16;en>>
Of course, that statement was made before the code was revised in January, 2016 to incorporate chapter 12.

<<2191.16;2204.96;en>>
To similar effect, those parts of their observations which focus on and criticize the disclosure, that's the disclosure that was made in the course of the proceedings before the IPT, tab 14, paragraph 47.

<<2204.96;2211.16;en>>
Those criticisms ignore the fact that the disclosure is now incorporated in the code.

<<2211.16;2219.16;en>>
That the code is a statutory document subject to consultation, which can only be amended with the consent of both houses of parliament.

<<2219.16;2226.32;en>>
And that this court has expressly found the provisions of the code can be taken into account in assessing foreseeability.

<<2226.32;2230.28;en>>
B. Kennedy in the United Kingdom at 157.

<<2230.28;2236.52;en>>
Thirdly, the applicants state that the arrangements appear to provide no protection at all for communications data.

<<2236.52;2238.4;en>>
Again, we respectfully disagree.

<<2238.4;2260.32;en>>
Chapter 12 of the code expressly states that where intercepted content or communications data are obtained from a foreign intelligence partner, they must be subject to the same internal rules and safeguards applying to the same categories of content or data obtained directly as a result of RIPA interception.

<<2260.32;2272.16;en>>
In relation to the quality of law, to move to that subject briefly, the applicant's core complaint is to say that the regime is, as they put it, so complex as to be inaccessible.

<<2272.16;2276.28;en>>
But that complaint, we suggest, falls at the first hurdle here.

<<2276.28;2285.04;en>>
There is no dispute between the parties as to what the regime actually is, nor any contention by the applicants that they are unable to understand it.

<<2285.04;2294.36;en>>
The prime criticism made in this regard by independent reviewers has been that the legal framework for surveillance powers is fragmented.

<<2294.36;2301.76;en>>
However, that is a generalized complaint about a range of powers rather than one directed at the eight-four regime.

<<2301.76;2314.24;en>>
And it is a complaint that the government has now addressed by bringing most of the relevant powers together in a single new act, the Investigatory Powers Act 2016.

<<2314.24;2318.6;en>>
Three specific, and it might be thought subsidiary, points need to be picked up.

<<2318.6;2332.04;en>>
First, it is said that there is an absence of legal safeguards on the transfer of data out of the UK or the EU because the intelligence services are exempted from the eighth data protection principle.

<<2332.04;2333.96;en>>
That is simply wrong.

<<2333.96;2341.96;en>>
The Code sets out a number of such safeguards in detail at paragraph 7.3 to 7.5.

<<2341.96;2350.6;en>>
Secondly, the applicants criticized the distinction between external and internal communications in the section eight-four regime is unacceptably vague.

<<2350.6;2352.24;en>>
Again, they are wrong.

<<2352.24;2361.48;en>>
An external communication under section 20 of RIPA is one sent or received outside the British Islands.

<<2361.48;2370.52;en>>
A message from a sender in the British Islands sent to an ultimate recipient outside is treated as internal, irrespective of how it is routed.

<<2370.52;2373.4;en>>
There's nothing unclear about that approach.

<<2373.4;2379.92;en>>
Thirdly, the applicants attack the term national security as the basis for interception.

<<2379.92;2396.16;en>>
This court has recently found in RE and the United Kingdom that the term national security as used in RIPA is sufficiently clear to give citizens an adequate indication of the circumstances in which public authorities may resort to interception.

<<2396.16;2400.6;en>>
We see paragraph 133 of this court's judgment in that case.

<<2400.6;2405.92;en>>
There is no reason we submit to depart from that conclusion.

<<2405.92;2412.24;en>>
I will be much, much shorter in relation to the three remaining topics, which we've dealt with in detail in our observations.

<<2412.24;2429.2;en>>
So far as article six is concerned, in relation to engagement, the court has consistently held that legal challenges to secret surveillance by the state do not engage article six because they involve the exercise of state authority in the public interest.

<<2429.2;2438.28;en>>
See, for example, Klaas and Germany and Echimger and Bulgaria, the latter of which, of course, postdated the Kennedy decision.

<<2438.28;2443.0;en>>
We say that is the correct analysis.

<<2443.0;2452.24;en>>
We also note that the determination of a person's rights under articles eight or 10 does not necessarily involve any determination of civil rights.

<<2452.24;2458.44;en>>
If it did, Klaas and Echimger would have been decided differently.

<<2458.44;2472.12;en>>
As the ground chamber has observed in Marien, France, the fact that a dispute may have repercussions for private life does not suffice to bring the proceedings within the scope of civil rights protected by six one.

<<2472.12;2479.32;en>>
In relation to breach, the findings in Kennedy we submit are powerful against breach of article six.

<<2479.32;2490.88;en>>
The applicant's principal argument under this head concerns a file note, tab 11 of the core bundle, of a meeting between the security service and the IPT.

<<2490.88;2495.76;en>>
They misstate both the content and the effect of the note.

<<2495.76;2506.56;en>>
First, and contrary to the applicant's case, the note does not state that the security service, quote, would only search its records of persons specifically targeted.

<<2506.56;2516.24;en>>
It said it would not search large databases about the general population, for example, an electoral register, and that was a perfectly sensible approach.

<<2516.24;2532.36;en>>
It would be impracticable and pointless for the intelligence services to search through data sets concerning the general population when asked to respond to a complaint of unlawful surveillance if the complainant's data in such data sets was never accessed.

<<2532.36;2536.68;en>>
Nor was this some form of secret agreement as it's presented with the IPT.

<<2536.68;2539.4;en>>
It was not an agreement at all.

<<2539.4;2549.68;en>>
Secondly, there is no reason at all to think that the IPT did anything improper in attending such a meeting, or should have told the applicants about it.

<<2549.68;2561.24;en>>
The IPT is a specialist tribunal, and the nature of its casework means its members need to have a level of background understanding about the intelligence services' practices and procedures.

<<2561.24;2564.12;en>>
The meeting was simply an example of that.

<<2564.12;2570.6;en>>
In any case, the meeting was held in 2007, some six years before this case was brought.

<<2570.6;2583.68;en>>
Thirdly, there is no merit whatsoever in the suggestion that the security services' approach disabled, as it's put by the applicants, the IPT from properly investigating the applicants' complaints.

<<2583.68;2587.96;en>>
One only has to read their judgment to see that.

<<2587.96;2592.76;en>>
So far as Article 14 is concerned, I've said all I wish to say about that.

<<2592.76;2597.24;en>>
The same complaint that is now made was made before the IPT.

<<2597.24;2599.28;en>>
They dealt with it in their judgment.

<<2599.28;2612.84;en>>
They found at base that whatever difference of treatment there might be was fully justified in relation to the regime under Section 16, and I have no more to add in relation to that.

<<2612.84;2617.56;en>>
I finish, perhaps rather unusually finish, with admissibility.

<<2617.56;2622.72;en>>
But it is at least worth making a couple of short points in relation to admissibility to finish.

<<2622.72;2628.16;en>>
My submission is that much of these complaints should be declared inadmissible.

<<2628.16;2638.52;en>>
Indeed, the only complaint that this court should be entertaining is 10HR's application, and then only insofar as it concerns the Section 8.4 regime.

<<2638.52;2639.96;en>>
There are two points.

<<2639.96;2642.32;en>>
The first of them is victim status.

<<2642.32;2659.56;en>>
Neither the Big Brother Watch applicants nor the 10HR applicants who bring complaints about the intelligence-sharing regime have put forward any basis on which they are at realistic risk of having their communications intercepted by the US and shared with the UK.

<<2659.56;2665.12;en>>
Indeed, they assert that none of the statutory conditions for such sharing is met.

<<2665.12;2680.04;en>>
Moreover, the IPT has already found that the 10HR applicants were not victims of unlawful intelligence-sharing, so the conditions for victim status set out by the Grand Chamber in Zakharoff are not satisfied.

<<2680.04;2687.4;en>>
As to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism's complaint about Section 22 of RIPA, the problem is even starker there.

<<2687.4;2699.44;en>>
The BIJ complained to this court that its communications data might have been intercepted under Section 22, but Section 22 of RIPA has nothing whatever to do with interception.

<<2699.44;2705.6;en>>
It concerns notices to service providers requiring the provision of communications data.

<<2705.6;2710.68;en>>
Nothing in the BIJ's application or evidence suggests that such a notice has been issued.

<<2710.68;2723.12;en>>
They do not belong to a group of persons targeted by the Section 22 regime, and if they were concerned that such notice had been issued, they could have applied to the IPT, which would have investigated.

<<2723.12;2728.52;en>>
The second of the points, and the final point, is non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.

<<2728.52;2744.72;en>>
The effectiveness and benefits of the IPT are, we respectfully submit, absolutely clear from the detail of their judgment in the liberty privacy proceedings, and the applicants, all applicants, should be required to use that process.

<<2744.72;2754.96;en>>
In the liberty proceedings, the IPT gave a thorough and comprehensive judgment, which clearly set out all aspects of the interference with the rights of the applicants in those cases.

<<2754.96;2762.8;en>>
It provided appropriate remedies, and where it found the general legal regime unlawful, the government acted to change it.

<<2762.8;2767.56;en>>
That has been the government's universal reaction to IPT rulings.

<<2767.56;2791.0;en>>
This court, of course, has recently found, in Antony, France, and the UK, that the IPT's lack of power to make a declaration of incompatibility under the Human Rights Act did not mean that the applicants had suffered, quote, a significant disadvantage, where the government similarly acted to change the law, following a thorough and comprehensive IPT judgment.

<<2791.0;2806.56;en>>
The court declared their applications inadmissible accordingly, and we submit that the logical corollary of this court's approach in the France application is that the IPT should now be considered an effective remedy that needs to be pursued.

<<2806.56;2809.4;en>>
For those reasons, Mr. President, members of the court,

<<2809.4;2815.52;en>>
the government invites this court to declare the applications inadmissible.

<<2815.52;2819.12;en>>
Alternatively, we ask the court to decide on the merits that there has been no violation of the convention.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<2824.82;2826.58;en>>
Thank you for your submissions.

<<2826.58;2828.74;en>>
I now invite Mrs. Rose QC.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<2831.65;2834.17;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<2834.17;2847.93;en>>
the issues before the court today first came to light as a result of the disclosures of classified information made in 2013 by Edward Snowden, who formerly worked for the CIA and the American National Security Agency.

<<2847.93;2849.93;en>>
Mr. Snowden revealed the existence

<<2849.93;2856.73;en>>
of two previously unknown practices carried out by the UK intelligence agencies.

<<2856.73;2866.81;en>>
First, the extent of their involvement in the bulk interception of telephone and internet communications which traverse the United Kingdom.

<<2866.81;2882.89;en>>
The Snowden revelations made clear for the first time the enormous scale of such collection, and the fact that GCHQ do not simply intercept the communications in bulk, scan them, and keep the data of the persons in whom they have an interest.

<<2882.89;2897.37;en>>
In fact, they retain and store very large volumes of data relating to millions of people, even where those individuals are of no intelligence interest at all.

<<2897.37;2911.81;en>>
This activity is conducted under the authority of general warrants, authorized only by the Secretary of State without any prior approval by a judge or by any independent body.

<<2911.81;2920.43;en>>
The United Kingdom government refuses to confirm or deny whether they keep the content of the communications they collect.

<<2920.43;2926.49;en>>
However, they do accept that they keep all of the communications data.

<<2926.49;2942.05;en>>
In other words, the data that is associated with a communication, which reveals a person's location, the identity of the persons or websites they've contacted, and the occasions when contact has been made.

<<2942.05;2950.53;en>>
Such data enables intrusion into the most intimate aspects of a person's daily life.

<<2950.53;2960.61;en>>
The United Kingdom legislation under which this program is conducted is, of course, the regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, commonly known as RIPA.

<<2960.61;2980.13;en>>
The provisions of RIPA are so complex and opaque that the existence and extent of this activity had not previously been appreciated, even by the expert NGOs operating in this field, including the applicants who are before this court today.

<<2980.13;2994.75;en>>
It is now clear that the degree of interception identified in the case of liberty against the United Kingdom, considered by this court in 2008, represented only the tip of the iceberg.

<<2994.75;3011.57;en>>
This court ruled in the liberty case that the United Kingdom's arrangements under RIPA's predecessor, the Interception of Communications Act 1985, failed the requirement under Article 8 that the arrangements should be in accordance with law.

<<3011.57;3024.29;en>>
The extent of bulk surveillance which is now known is far wider than was appreciated then, and the applicable safeguards are even more clearly defective.

<<3024.29;3027.25;en>>
The second practice that was revealed by Mr. Snowden

<<3027.25;3039.99;en>>
is the fact that the American National Security Agency and other foreign agencies share with the United Kingdom the data that they have themselves intercepted and collected.

<<3039.99;3048.41;en>>
Even the minimal provisions of RIPA do not apply to the use of this material by the UK agencies.

<<3048.41;3075.95;en>>
We say that what has now come to light shows that the UK is interfering with the applicants' rights to respect for their private lives in ways that are not in accordance with the law because of the lack of foreseeability and accessibility of the applicable legal principles, which lack the necessary basic safeguards essential to prevent the risk of abuse or arbitrary or unlawful conduct by the state, and which are disproportionate.

<<3075.95;3089.97;en>>
The activities also breach the applicants' rights to freedom of expression, including the vitally important right for journalists and human rights NGOs freely to impart and receive information in confidence.

<<3089.97;3102.93;en>>
And they discriminate indirectly on the grounds of nationality by treating those who are located outside the United Kingdom less favorably than those inside the United Kingdom without justification.

<<3102.93;3114.57;en>>
Finally, but importantly, we say that the specialist tribunal appointed under RIPA to hear these complaints, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, operates in a way that breaches Article 6.

<<3114.57;3120.61;en>>
It lacks independence from the agencies whose conduct it has been created to supervise.

<<3120.61;3124.17;en>>
Its procedures are flawed and unfair.

<<3124.17;3129.09;en>>
And the remedies it can give are inadequate.

<<3129.09;3136.61;en>>
There are three features of the background against which these applications have been made which deserve emphasis.

<<3136.61;3154.61;en>>
First, we do say that the United Kingdom has a history of persistent and repeated breaches of Article 8 in the field of state surveillance, which its domestic courts have failed properly to restrain.

<<3154.61;3159.45;en>>
We've dealt with this in our observations at paragraphs 4 to 26.

<<3159.45;3165.61;en>>
It is possible that this record reflects the United Kingdom's relative good fortune.

<<3165.61;3184.81;en>>
Unlike some other member states of the Council of Europe, the UK has not so far had to learn the bitter experience of the extent to which secret and unaccountable surveillance by the state can undermine democracy and freedom.

<<3184.81;3191.45;en>>
Secondly, this is an area of very rapid technological change.

<<3191.45;3198.93;en>>
We address this important issue in our observations at paragraphs 9 to 12 and 79 to 89.

<<3198.93;3203.09;en>>
The rapid technological development has two consequences.

<<3203.09;3224.73;en>>
First, the intrusion into the private lives of individuals which is represented by this activity is far greater now than it would have been only a few years ago because so much private and personal material is online and because it can now be easily stored and searched in vast quantities.

<<3224.73;3238.17;en>>
And secondly, features of the domestic legislation which were intended to provide some sort of safeguard for privacy rights have now been overtaken by technological change which renders them ineffective.

<<3238.17;3251.97;en>>
An example of this is the distinction in RIPA between internal and external communications based on whether the sender and the recipient are both in the British islands or one of them is abroad.

<<3251.97;3263.89;en>>
That distinction, which is the foundation for a differential regime of protection under RIPA, is now virtually meaningless for reasons I shall return to.

<<3263.89;3275.61;en>>
Finally, we acknowledge the security threats and the problems posed by serious crime which are relied on by the United Kingdom to justify its activities.

<<3275.61;3283.41;en>>
Nothing that we say today should be taken in any way to seek to minimize or understate the seriousness of these threats.

<<3283.41;3284.97;en>>
They are grave.

<<3284.97;3291.61;en>>
And it is important that the competent authorities have the right tools to be able to address them.

<<3291.61;3302.29;en>>
Combating these threats requires concerted police and intelligence activity, including the use of covert surveillance and the interception of communications.

<<3302.29;3311.13;en>>
However, these operations must be conducted within the framework of the convention and the framework of law.

<<3311.13;3324.09;en>>
Excessive or unaccountable state surveillance puts at risk the very core values of the free and democratic societies that terrorism seeks to undermine.

<<3324.09;3334.09;en>>
The United Kingdom has not sought to derogate from Articles 8 or 10 of the convention because of the severity of the current security threats.

<<3334.09;3347.49;en>>
And crucially, the government does not and could not suggest in this case that proper safeguards cannot be put in place to protect fundamental rights without jeopardizing national security.

<<3347.49;3360.45;en>>
The lack of safeguards in the UK's legislation is out of line with that of other Council of Europe states, such as the German regime that we've examined at paragraph 21 of our observations.

<<3360.45;3368.73;en>>
Moreover, since the events with which this application is concerned, the United Kingdom has, as Mr. Eadie has said,

<<3368.73;3376.37;en>>
produced new legislation which contains additional safeguards, under pressure in particular from the CJEU.

<<3376.37;3382.73;en>>
We addressed that legislation at paragraphs 28 and 129 of our observations.

<<3382.73;3385.69;en>>
We do not accept that the new safeguards are sufficient.

<<3385.69;3387.81;en>>
That's an issue for another day.

<<3387.81;3405.33;en>>
But for today's purposes, it is enough for us to point out that the government's assertion that the opacity of the old RIPA regime was necessary to enable the effective protection of national security is untenable.

<<3405.33;3410.01;en>>
We invite this court to declare the breaches that we've identified.

<<3410.01;3418.57;en>>
It will then, of course, be for the United Kingdom authorities to implement the court's judgment and to remedy the breaches.

<<3418.57;3430.97;en>>
Contrary to the, with respect, hyperbolic suggestion in the United Kingdom government's written observations, such an approach in no way undermines the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.

<<3430.97;3444.93;en>>
It is merely the proper performance of the function of this court, whose jurisdiction the United Kingdom, in exercise of its sovereignty, has voluntarily accepted.

<<3444.93;3450.29;en>>
I now turn to consider the domestic legislation and to identify its key flaws.

<<3450.29;3457.49;en>>
I shall focus on convention breaches arising from the bulk interception, storage, and searching of data by the United Kingdom.

<<3457.49;3471.13;en>>
And Miss Mountfield will consider the question of the United Kingdom's sharing of data intercepted by foreign states, as well as the questions of victim status and the exhaustion of domestic remedies.

<<3471.13;3488.89;en>>
As the court knows, section 1 of RIPA prohibits the interception of the contents of communications in the course of their transmission, save where the interception is authorized by other provisions of the act, which include a warrant under section 5 of RIPA.

<<3488.89;3495.93;en>>
Such a warrant requires no independent prior authorization by a judge or any other body.

<<3495.93;3508.17;en>>
The sole authority to issue the warrant rests with the Secretary of State, who is, of course, an integral part of the executive and the government minister responsible for the agencies.

<<3508.17;3516.53;en>>
The permissible contents of a warrant issued by the Secretary of State are set out at section 8 of RIPA.

<<3516.53;3521.69;en>>
Sections 8.1 and 8.2 appear to limit the circumstances

<<3521.69;3524.29;en>>
in which a warrant may be issued.

<<3524.29;3532.37;en>>
Under those provisions, a warrant must name or describe one person or a single set of premises.

<<3532.37;3546.17;en>>
Schedules must be provided, setting out the addresses, phone numbers, the apparatus, in other words, the individual computers, or other factors to be used to identify the communications that may be intercepted.

<<3546.17;3560.33;en>>
The aim of these provisions is to ensure that the secret authorization by the executive of the interception of the contents of someone's communications is narrowly tailored to an individual suspect.

<<3560.33;3568.85;en>>
The general searching of communications in the hope that something relevant might be discovered is prohibited.

<<3568.85;3574.57;en>>
However, section 8.4 sets out an exception

<<3574.57;3577.85;en>>
where the safeguards laid down by sections 8.1 and 2

<<3577.85;3579.69;en>>
do not apply at all.

<<3579.69;3585.93;en>>
And it is the scope of that exception which is the foundation of our case.

<<3585.93;3589.13;en>>
Under section 8.4, general warrants

<<3589.13;3612.81;en>>
may be issued without any tailoring to individuals where the Secretary of State has issued a certificate certifying that she considers that the examination of material described in the warrant is necessary in the interest of national security, the prevention or detection of serious crime, or safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.

<<3612.81;3622.61;en>>
And where the conduct authorized by the warrant consists first of the interception of external communications.

<<3622.61;3628.97;en>>
And secondly, other conduct identified under section 5.6.

<<3628.97;3633.97;en>>
Crucially, section 5.6 permits the interception

<<3633.97;3644.85;en>>
of communications not identified by the warrant, which is necessary in order to do what the warrant expressly authorizes.

<<3644.85;3648.61;en>>
Although the section 8.4 power is purportedly

<<3648.61;3655.29;en>>
limited to external communications, that limitation is now effectively meaningless.

<<3655.29;3669.49;en>>
Most communications by phone or by internet, even between two individuals who are both in the United Kingdom, pass outside the United Kingdom in the course of their transmission.

<<3669.49;3690.97;en>>
Even if those communications between two individuals in the UK are not in themselves classified as external communications, they will be captured in the bulk collection of external communications because they will be part of the whole of the pipe that is being intercepted.

<<3690.97;3696.37;en>>
This ancillary form of collection is permitted by section 5.6.

<<3696.37;3707.85;en>>
That allows the whole communication link, the whole cable, to be intercepted, whether or not each individual communication in the cable is external.

<<3707.85;3722.77;en>>
The result is that a section 4 warrant can be used, and is used, to intercept a massive volume of communications, including communications between persons who are both in the United Kingdom.

<<3722.77;3739.81;en>>
It is also the case, and the government accepts this, that communications with a server outside the United Kingdom, including Google searches and Facebook posts, are classified as external communications.

<<3739.81;3750.33;en>>
So-called safeguards for these general certificated warrants under section 8.4 are provided under sections 15 and 16.

<<3750.33;3753.69;en>>
In particular, section 16.2.

<<3753.69;3761.89;en>>
That provision is far from clear, but what it seems to mean is that the contents of intercepted communications obtained under a section 8.4

<<3761.89;3770.17;en>>
warrant may not be read, looked at, or listened to, if the person is known to be in the United Kingdom.

<<3770.17;3781.57;en>>
So if a person is or might be outside the UK, the contents of their communications may be examined without any individual warrant or authorization whatsoever.

<<3781.57;3788.57;en>>
Those safeguards apply only to the content of communications.

<<3788.57;3807.85;en>>
Section 16 provides no meaningful safeguard for the storing, searching, and use of communications data, because under section 20, data of that kind does not fall within the definition of intercepted material to which the section 16 safeguards apply.

<<3807.85;3812.41;en>>
We say this is a fatal flaw in the legislative regime.

<<3812.41;3829.89;en>>
Communications data, unlike content, can be used for purposes outside the scope of the purposes for which the original collection was certified by the Secretary of State and may be examined by a state official whether a person is within or outside the UK.

<<3829.89;3847.41;en>>
So for example, if the collection of a pipe was justified on national security grounds, communications data relating to communications between people in the UK could be examined for other reasons, including serious crime or economic well-being.

<<3847.41;3873.73;en>>
The effect is that GCHQ, under the UK legal regime, can keep, search, and use all the communications data they obtain from intercepting an entire communications link, even when that data belongs to people in the UK who are of no legitimate intelligence interest, and even if they relate to communications between two people both inside the UK.

<<3873.73;3878.49;en>>
We say that the use by the UK of Section 8.4 bulk warrants

<<3878.49;3894.25;en>>
involves multiple breaches of Article 8 at every stage of the operation on interception, on storage, on scanning and profiling, and on searching and use of the data.

<<3894.25;3899.17;en>>
And interference with privacy rights must be in accordance with law.

<<3899.17;3903.73;en>>
To satisfy that requirement, it must have a basis in domestic law.

<<3903.73;3906.77;en>>
It must be foreseeable in its scope and application.

<<3906.77;3912.65;en>>
It must include adequate safeguards to protect against arbitrary interference by the state.

<<3912.65;3916.45;en>>
We say this regime fails the test of foreseeability.

<<3916.45;3922.21;en>>
The manner in which these very broad statutory powers is exercised remains largely secret.

<<3922.21;3934.49;en>>
The IPT has concluded that it's sufficient for the foreseeability criterion to be met if there's a secret policy, a secret policy which regulates its operation.

<<3934.49;3940.37;en>>
These are the policies the IPT refers to as below the waterline policies.

<<3940.37;3945.69;en>>
We're told there are such policies in this case, though of course we have not seen them.

<<3945.69;3952.13;en>>
The use of a metaphor in place of legal analysis is often a warning sign.

<<3952.13;3954.17;en>>
And so it is in this case.

<<3954.17;3970.41;en>>
A policy which is secret cannot by definition meet the convention requirement that the legal parameters by which the state may interfere with a fundamental right should be accessible to individuals and foreseeable to them so that they can regulate their conduct accordingly.

<<3970.41;3979.85;en>>
In any event, the issue of a section 8-4 warrant hinges on the Secretary of State's assessment that the warrant is necessary for the protection of national security.

<<3979.85;3989.93;en>>
As explained at paragraph 113 of our submissions, that concept is so broad and vague that it fails to satisfy the Article 8 requirements.

<<3989.93;3997.77;en>>
Secondly, and crucially, the regime lacks the safeguards necessary to protect against arbitrary state interference.

<<3997.77;4006.77;en>>
The minimum safeguards regarded as constituting the necessary minimum by this court so far are those enumerated in Waiver.

<<4006.77;4009.29;en>>
And it was striking to hear Mr. Eadie this morning

<<4009.29;4013.01;en>>
seek to invite the court to water those down.

<<4013.01;4018.01;en>>
The UK argues that the Waiver safeguards apply only to content.

<<4018.01;4026.25;en>>
They're driven to that position because of the lack of any effective safeguards under the domestic regime to cover communications data.

<<4026.25;4028.25;en>>
This argument is misconceived.

<<4028.25;4035.77;en>>
If adopted by this court, it would severely undermine the effective protection of Article 8 rights.

<<4035.77;4043.61;en>>
The relevant question is not whether data is categorized under domestic law as content or as communications data.

<<4043.61;4053.57;en>>
A proper question is how severely the interception, storage, and use of that data interferes with privacy rights.

<<4053.57;4059.05;en>>
The interference in relation to communications data is very severe.

<<4059.05;4066.65;en>>
This data enables the state to build up intrusive personal profiles of the lives of huge numbers of individuals.

<<4066.65;4072.77;en>>
And we've dealt with this at paragraphs 11 to 13 and 116 of our observations.

<<4072.77;4091.61;en>>
We invite this court, as courts in the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom have already done, explicitly to recognize the gravity of the interference with privacy rights that comes from the searching and use of communications data.

<<4091.61;4098.53;en>>
Collection and use of communications data interferes not only with privacy rights, but also the right to freedom of expression.

<<4098.53;4103.45;en>>
And this is in our observations at 148 to 154.

<<4103.45;4118.29;en>>
The state may use communications data to reconstruct the identities of persons with whom a journalist or a human rights NGO has had contact, the occasions and places where they've done so, the websites and the places they visited.

<<4118.29;4133.85;en>>
It is above all the state's access to this data which has the chilling effect on the ability of journalists and NGOs to contact sources and witnesses or whistleblowers and to investigate potential abuses of fundamental rights.

<<4133.85;4150.01;en>>
We therefore submit that the collection and use of communications data is a severe interference with privacy rights and with freedom of expression for which the application of the Weber minimum safeguards is essential to protect against the arbitrary abuse of state power.

<<4150.01;4158.85;en>>
The absence of proper safeguards applicable to communications data is a clear breach of Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention.

<<4158.85;4163.37;en>>
But in fact, the Weber safeguards are not met even in relation to content in this case.

<<4163.37;4171.01;en>>
And we have explained this point at paragraphs 120 to 127 of our consolidated observations.

<<4171.01;4175.93;en>>
And we also say that the Weber safeguards are not the end of this matter.

<<4175.93;4190.29;en>>
As this court noted in Zabo, those safeguards should now be updated in the light of technological change and the vastly increased capabilities of state agencies to store and interrogate private data.

<<4190.29;4202.43;en>>
We submit that there are three enhanced safeguards that should be applied to modern forms of surveillance because without them, there is no practical or effective protection for Article 8 or 10 rights.

<<4202.43;4220.73;en>>
First, we invite this court to make it clear that prior independent judicial authorization is required for the issue of a warrant permitting bulk interception and collection of the content of communications and associated communications data.

<<4220.73;4231.61;en>>
Secondly, that a warrant should be issued only where there's objective evidence of reasonable suspicion of a serious crime or conduct amounting to a specific threat to national security.

<<4231.61;4244.89;en>>
And third, that where possible, there should be provision for the notification of those whose data has been accessed after the event so they have a meaningful opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of the action taken against them.

<<4244.89;4247.97;en>>
The United Kingdom says these safeguards are not necessary.

<<4247.97;4254.77;en>>
It makes much of the existence of the IPT and the various commissioners as providing sufficient oversight.

<<4254.77;4258.61;en>>
Those institutions are not sufficient.

<<4258.61;4269.87;en>>
Given the breadth and the scope of the warrants in question, which do not require any evidence of reasonable suspicion, it is difficult to see what effective action the commissioners could take.

<<4269.87;4274.61;en>>
Any action they do take will, of course, be after the event.

<<4274.61;4279.17;en>>
There is also a serious question of practicality and resources.

<<4279.17;4291.61;en>>
The government accepts at paragraph 70 of its observations that oversight by the commissioners consists of a total of 15 person days per year.

<<4291.61;4299.79;en>>
This is obviously inadequate to enable the conduct of any thorough or detailed audit or oversight of the agencies.

<<4299.79;4308.97;en>>
The GCHQ's website says it employs over 6,000 people, MI5 around 4,000, MI6 at least 2,500.

<<4308.97;4315.25;en>>
It is impossible for the commissioners to provide meaningful control over their activities.

<<4315.25;4324.77;en>>
Only scrutiny of the necessity and proportionality of warrants in advance by a judge can satisfy that requirement.

<<4324.77;4332.97;en>>
I've made the point that people whose communications are intercepted and examined are never notified that this has occurred.

<<4332.97;4340.73;en>>
In the absence of such notification, the right of access to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal is largely futile.

<<4340.73;4354.93;en>>
With no way of knowing that they have been the subject of state surveillance, the vast majority of people have no reason to apply to the IPT to discover whether the surveillance to which they've subjected was or was not lawful.

<<4354.93;4360.69;en>>
The defendant says that notification after the event might jeopardize intelligence operations.

<<4360.69;4371.29;en>>
Even if that were so in some cases, that cannot be an adequate reason for making no provision for such notification in any case.

<<4371.29;4379.35;en>>
Other jurisdictions have been able to make provision for notification after the event, apparently without jeopardizing their intelligence operations.

<<4379.35;4385.61;en>>
They include Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Belgium, and Switzerland.

<<4385.61;4398.89;en>>
This court was right in its judgment in the case of Association for European Integration in 2013 to note that the lack of provision for such notification under Bulgarian law was a missing important safeguard against improper use.

<<4398.89;4401.85;en>>
That was paragraph 91 of that judgment.

<<4401.85;4408.53;en>>
So for all these reasons, we say that the United Kingdom regime under 8.4 fails the test that it

<<4408.53;4415.61;en>>
must be in accordance with law, just as the old regime failed the test in 2008.

<<4415.61;4421.15;en>>
In any event, we say that the practice of the UK is disproportionate.

<<4421.15;4429.41;en>>
It appears that the UK is systematically collecting both communications data and content on a massive scale under cover of section 8.4

<<4429.41;4433.25;en>>
and retaining it for future searching and use.

<<4433.25;4446.85;en>>
Such a blanket approach falls foul of principles established by this court in Ess and Marpa and in MK and France in relation to the mass retention of DNA or fingerprints, even from those who were not charged or been acquitted.

<<4446.85;4462.61;en>>
The fact that it's now possible for the state to retain private information about the population at large, which it was not in the past, and that retaining such information may be operationally useful does not justify the intrusion of doing so.

<<4462.61;4467.25;en>>
Just because the state can do something doesn't mean that it should.

<<4467.25;4472.37;en>>
No doubt it would be possible to take DNA from every person in the United Kingdom and store it.

<<4472.37;4477.53;en>>
It could then be searched to identify the perpetrators of crimes where DNA evidence had been found.

<<4477.53;4480.45;en>>
The UK would say this was target discovery.

<<4480.45;4487.37;en>>
And no doubt this would assist the police in identifying hitherto unsuspected criminals.

<<4487.37;4491.21;en>>
Another word for that is not target discovery, but a fishing expedition.

<<4491.21;4498.81;en>>
And that is not a good enough reason to justify so wide an intrusion into everybody's Article 8 rights.

<<4498.81;4502.21;en>>
The UK seeks to argue that bulk intercept under 8.4

<<4502.21;4504.25;en>>
is a practical necessity.

<<4504.25;4505.81;en>>
They're wrong about that.

<<4505.81;4512.93;en>>
Even if it were necessary to intercept a whole cable, the excess data should then be promptly and automatically discarded.

<<4512.93;4515.61;en>>
But under 8.4, large amounts of data

<<4515.61;4524.05;en>>
belonging to citizens of no intelligence interest is not only being intercepted, it's being kept and subsequently analyzed and examined.

<<4524.05;4528.05;en>>
The UK disputes this as a matter of fact.

<<4528.05;4535.49;en>>
That dispute, of course, first ignores that that's precisely what this legislation permits without any proper formal control.

<<4535.49;4539.49;en>>
Secondly, we say it's factually incorrect.

<<4539.49;4546.29;en>>
It's of the very nature of this case that our knowledge of what the United Kingdom actually does is partial and limited.

<<4546.29;4561.89;en>>
But the Interception of Communications Commissioner himself said in May 2013 that it is GCHQ's practice to keep, and I quote, the entirety of all of the communications data that comes into the building.

<<4561.89;4564.97;en>>
That's at footnote six of our observations.

<<4564.97;4570.81;en>>
There can thus be no doubt that all the communications data is being kept.

<<4570.81;4578.45;en>>
Such information as we have been able to obtain about the UK's keeping of data is at paragraph 81 of our observations.

<<4578.45;4588.25;en>>
We include one example, the Optic Nerve Program, under which GCHQ collected and stored an image from every Yahoo chat user over five minutes.

<<4588.25;4593.05;en>>
That was a mass collection and storage of the content of communications.

<<4593.05;4596.33;en>>
1.8 million users were affected.

<<4596.33;4600.77;en>>
7% of the images were intimate and explicit.

<<4600.77;4609.77;en>>
These operations are now technically feasible, and they cannot be effectively prevented by the UK legislation because of the defects that I've identified.

<<4609.77;4614.05;en>>
The evidence shows they are, in fact, occurring.

<<4614.05;4620.13;en>>
The UK also says that the level of intrusion into privacy rights by bulk collection and searching is minimal.

<<4620.13;4621.25;en>>
That is wrong.

<<4621.25;4629.89;en>>
The true position is that because modern techniques make bulk data analyzable and comprehensible, the extent of the intrusion is potentially very great indeed.

<<4629.89;4636.21;en>>
And we address that point at paragraph 27 of our observations.

<<4636.21;4644.17;en>>
I've addressed Article 10, and I then don't propose to say more about discrimination at this stage, given the shortness of time.

<<4644.17;4648.61;en>>
I would like to say a few words about Article 6.

<<4648.61;4655.25;en>>
The UK says that when the IPT hears these complaints, it's not determining civil rights and obligations.

<<4655.25;4660.21;en>>
That submission is wrong for the reasons given by the IPT itself in Kennedy.

<<4660.21;4668.93;en>>
Whatever violations of Article 8 and 10 may be in other member states, in the United Kingdom, they are civil torts under the Human Rights Act.

<<4668.93;4676.89;en>>
A breach of Article 8 or Article 10 is a civil right in the United Kingdom, and therefore covered by Article 6.

<<4676.89;4681.73;en>>
At the time of the court's decision in Kennedy, the operation of the IPT had barely been tested.

<<4681.73;4687.05;en>>
Now it has been, and it's been shown to be neither independent nor fair.

<<4687.05;4705.65;en>>
We now know that the IPT, at the time it was considering these claims, was operating a secret policy, not to require the agencies to search their actual data holdings, but only requiring them to look at the search terms by reference to which their data holdings had been searched.

<<4705.65;4707.17;en>>
That was a basic flaw.

<<4707.17;4719.89;en>>
It will not uncover potential breaches, such as the situation where somebody's communications data has been retained for an excessive period of time but hasn't actually been accessed.

<<4719.89;4729.97;en>>
That policy was agreed at a secret meeting between MI5 and the IPT, of which the applicants were not informed.

<<4729.97;4731.89;en>>
Contrary to what Mr. Eadie says, that

<<4731.89;4744.45;en>>
was a wholly improper act by the tribunal, to meet in secret with one of the parties that appeared before it and to agree a process as to what disclosure was necessary.

<<4744.45;4747.57;en>>
That shows a fundamental lack of independence.

<<4747.57;4749.93;en>>
It was contrary to Article 6.

<<4749.93;4761.37;en>>
Notice of that meeting should have been given to applicants appearing before the tribunal, and they should have been told what policy had been agreed.

<<4761.37;4780.13;en>>
Secondly, in its conduct of these proceedings, the IPT's finding that Article 8 was complied with hinged in part on a closed secret hearing in which it inspected the so-called below-the-waterline policies and concluded that they contained significant safeguards.

<<4780.13;4784.65;en>>
I've already explained why that type of secret law cannot satisfy Article 8.

<<4784.65;4797.53;en>>
We also say that the procedure that was used by the IPT here is a breach of Article 6, because those secret policies remain unscrutinized, unanalyzed.

<<4797.53;4807.39;en>>
Finally, when making its findings of breach, insufficient details were provided about the unlawful surveillance of the NGOs, amnesty, and the Legal Resources Centre.

<<4807.39;4814.17;en>>
The effect is that details of the agency's unlawful conduct remain concealed.

<<4814.17;4822.29;en>>
There might be legitimate reasons for secrecy over lawful surveillance, but there's no good reason for secrecy to cover up unlawful conduct.

<<4822.29;4832.45;en>>
The failure to give proper reasons for its decision that there had been breaches of Article 8 was itself a breach of Article 6 by the tribunal.

<<4832.45;4838.87;en>>
For all these reasons, we invite the court to find breaches of Articles 8, 10, 14, and 6.

<<4838.87;4840.97;en>>
And I now hand over to Ms. Mountfield

<<4840.97;4842.07;en>>
to deal with the remaining issues.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<4846.13;4848.77;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<4848.77;4851.97;en>>
as well as the TEMPRA program, which Ms. Rose has addressed

<<4851.97;4870.65;en>>
to you, the Snowden disclosures also revealed extensive interception of communications data by the United States National Security Agency, which data are then accessed, retained, and analyzed by the United Kingdom Intelligence Services and other state bodies in the United Kingdom.

<<4870.65;4872.81;en>>
That is what Snowden revealed.

<<4872.81;4884.09;en>>
But this case is about the practice of the UK Intelligence Services, not any particular data interception program by any particular third country state.

<<4884.09;4903.25;en>>
And the United States is by no means necessarily the only non-counsel of Europe security service with which the UK Intelligence Services have a close working relationship, and from which they may obtain and use large quantities of intercepted communications and communications data.

<<4903.25;4919.77;en>>
In relation to this third country intercept data, even the RIPA limits on interception, inadequate as they are, do not apply, because the interception is not conducted by a person who is in or governed by the law of the United Kingdom.

<<4919.77;4937.85;en>>
But the United Kingdom Intelligence Service access to this third country intercept data is no less damaging to privacy of persons inside the Council of Europe than the retention and use of data which has been gathered by the UK Intelligence Services themselves.

<<4937.85;4944.47;en>>
So take, for example, two people, A and B, and they're in next door flats or offices in the United Kingdom.

<<4944.47;4955.29;en>>
And they communicate by email, and their communications or communications data are accessed and analyzed and stored by the UK Intelligence Services.

<<4955.29;4970.21;en>>
If A and B's communication happens to be routed through a computer server which is located in the United Kingdom, then the government accepts that sections 8, 1, and 5, 6, and 16 of RIPA apply.

<<4970.21;4977.97;en>>
In other words, whatever defects there may be to those provisions, they are relatively precise and individually tailored legal safeguards.

<<4977.97;4981.81;en>>
And those are ones that the state considers to be necessary.

<<4981.81;4992.29;en>>
So the questions for the court are, why those protections are not also required if A and B happen to communicate through a server located in the United States?

<<4992.29;4997.21;en>>
That's the question of external communications, which Ms. Rose has addressed.

<<4997.21;5022.63;en>>
And how it can be acceptable that no warrant and no RIPA safeguards at all are required if the actual interception happens to have been conducted by a third country intelligence service, even though the data from that is then accessed and analysed and stored by the United Kingdom Intelligence Services in precisely the same way as if it had conducted the interception itself?

<<5022.63;5026.49;en>>
The route by which that data travels is a matter of chance.

<<5026.49;5032.05;en>>
And so now is the identity of the agency which happens to conduct the interception.

<<5032.05;5048.29;en>>
So the fact that domestic law offers such different protections to the same uses by the same security service of the same data, simply by virtue of the route by which it's travelled or the identity of the agency which has intercepted it, appears quite arbitrary.

<<5048.29;5052.01;en>>
It certainly calls for a rational explanation.

<<5052.01;5055.25;en>>
And none has been provided.

<<5055.25;5084.45;en>>
In the RE and the United Kingdom case, this court established in paragraphs 129 and 30 of its judgment that the decisive factor in deciding what Article 8 safeguards are needed to prevent arbitrary or disproportionate interference with privacy is the extent of the interference with an individual right to respect for a person's private life in a particular context, not the definition of the technological means used to conduct the intrusion.

<<5084.45;5102.61;en>>
By parity of reasoning, nor should the extent of protection which is required or applied depend on whether the state itself operates the technology or relies on a partner outside the Council of Europe to do the intercepting and share the product.

<<5102.61;5125.01;en>>
And the nature of the internet now and the nature of the interception capabilities of security services while data is being transmitted mean that there is no longer, as there once may have been, any obvious difference between what a well-equipped foreign intelligence service can do and what the UK's own security services can do.

<<5125.01;5136.21;en>>
Third-country intercept data is likely to be precisely the same data that the UK intelligence services could gather for themselves if they had the resources and capability.

<<5136.21;5149.97;en>>
And that's particularly true, and obviously true, of US interception because the United States is, as the National Security Agency itself has said, a principal hub in the world's telecommunications system.

<<5149.97;5185.35;en>>
So because the central privacy concern which arises from the Snowden disclosures is the UK intelligence services' extensive and previously secret abilities to access and store and use what may be profoundly private communications, the same safeguards should be applied, whether that is done directly by the UK's intelligence services using their own interception capacity or through data sharing with intelligence agencies located outside the Council of Europe.

<<5185.35;5193.01;en>>
The invasion of privacy is precisely the same if the UK intelligence services access third-country intercept.

<<5193.01;5201.37;en>>
And since the invasion of privacy is the same, the necessary safeguards against arbitrary or disproportionate activities are no less.

<<5201.37;5208.35;en>>
There simply can be no principled justification for a lesser degree of legal protection.

<<5208.35;5211.57;en>>
But contrary to the case that Mr. Eadie presented to you,

<<5211.57;5228.29;en>>
there is indeed no domestic legal framework which adequately specifies the authority upon which and the circumstances in which third-party intercept data can be accessed and stored and used by the United Kingdom intelligence services.

<<5228.29;5235.69;en>>
And the government accepts that there is no express statutory framework analogous to RIPA which governs this.

<<5235.69;5240.25;en>>
And so Mr. Eadie is wrong to say that it is nonsense to suggest

<<5240.25;5243.89;en>>
that there is intercept which is not covered by a warrant.

<<5243.89;5247.85;en>>
There is, and paragraph 12.4 of the Code of Practice

<<5247.85;5249.89;en>>
illustrates that.

<<5249.89;5257.73;en>>
The Code of Practice accepts, sorry, the government instead relies on a patchwork, a very broad enabling provisions.

<<5257.73;5263.09;en>>
They've buried the details of that in footnote 72 of their observations.

<<5263.09;5277.09;en>>
But this is not sufficiently tailored to provide reasonable or sufficient foreseeability as to the circumstances in which third-country interception data is used by the UK intelligence services and other state agencies.

<<5277.09;5290.93;en>>
In particular, it is not the Secretary of State or even a senior official who decides whether it is necessary to obtain or analyze or store the data received for the very broad permitted statutory purposes.

<<5290.93;5300.89;en>>
The legislation provides no concrete guidance to that official or even the public as to how such a decision will be taken or in accordance with what principles.

<<5300.89;5316.69;en>>
So in effect, there is a broad and inadequately constrained statutory discretion to obtain and analyze and store third-country intelligence intercept for any of the purposes which the UK intelligence services may deem it necessary.

<<5316.69;5324.69;en>>
When these applications were brought, there was not even any provision in any Code of Practice which addressed the issue of intelligence sharing at all.

<<5324.69;5330.53;en>>
So this case is on all fours with the Liberty and the UK decision in that respect.

<<5330.53;5334.97;en>>
And that level of opacity was unnecessary and unjustified.

<<5334.97;5343.89;en>>
And that illustrated by the fact that the code was changed in January 2016 so that Chapter 12 did make some mention of this.

<<5343.89;5348.37;en>>
But in fact, Chapter 12 does not answer the applicants' objections in any event.

<<5348.37;5357.93;en>>
It doesn't provide sufficient clarity as to the process by which or the principles upon which third-party intercept data will be used so as to comply with Article 8.

<<5357.93;5362.01;en>>
And I invite your attention in particular to paragraph 12.4

<<5362.01;5369.01;en>>
little Roman 3 to illustrate the breadth of the circumstances in which this data can be used.

<<5369.01;5386.65;en>>
So the respondent is forced to fall back on secret undisclosed arrangements, which it says are sufficient to ensure that data is not used in an arbitrary or disproportionate way, and the application of the REAPER principles to foreign intercept as a matter of policy.

<<5386.65;5394.41;en>>
And that is not enough to comply with the quality of law requirements in Article 8.

<<5394.41;5400.39;en>>
And the uses of technologies and known interception capacities have, as Ms. Rose said, changed radically

<<5400.39;5405.65;en>>
since this court last considered interception by the United Kingdom.

<<5405.65;5420.21;en>>
But the core values and the importance of the individual sphere of private interaction and private correspondence, which the convention is intended to respect, protect, and preserve, have not changed.

<<5420.21;5433.21;en>>
And so their importance has, if anything, been augmented by the pace and scale of the increase in the technological capacity of foreign intelligence services, as this court said in the Schaubo case.

<<5433.21;5443.57;en>>
There is no convincing submission to support the respondent's assertion that the Weber safeguards would in some way be overbroad if applied to third country intercept data.

<<5443.57;5457.09;en>>
The breadth of the potential safeguards requires only reflects the breadth of what foreign intelligence services may now be able to scoop up in states to which the Council of Europe standards do not directly apply.

<<5457.09;5470.29;en>>
And the extent and degree of intrusion here is of a significantly greater order of magnitude, even than the Weber case, which concerned only up to 10% of all communications.

<<5470.29;5488.65;en>>
So we develop our submission about why the Weber safeguards and additional protections highlighted with the rows are not satisfied by the legal regime, which governs access to third party interception data in paragraphs 138 to 145 of our consolidated submissions.

<<5488.65;5497.25;en>>
The consequence of this is that the risk of widespread interferences of communications is very grave and virtually legally unconstrained.

<<5497.25;5514.45;en>>
And this matters a great deal because without a clear and accessible legal framework, there is an obvious danger that domestic protections for private communications can be circumvented by the use of third party interception data from states where Council of Europe standards do not apply.

<<5514.45;5533.61;en>>
And this is a particular concern for journalists and human rights organizations, such as those before the court, because it may have a chilling effect on important political communication, which is not only the heart of a democratic society, but is vital for the protection of such a society.

<<5533.61;5559.49;en>>
And it is no answer to this concern to say simply that access to foreign security services intercept is not in fact used to circumvent the existing legal controls in the United Kingdom, or that it would be a public law wrong if it were, because there is no public or accessible legal framework which can make this assurance good, and because, of course, no one knows the circumstances of an individual case.

<<5559.49;5579.93;en>>
So even if it is in fact the position, and on this the applicants cannot and therefore do not make any submissions, that access is not misused, nonetheless, access to interception by the UK intelligence service still violates Article 8, because it is not clearly and accessibly prescribed by law.

<<5579.93;5584.53;en>>
I turn very briefly in view of the time to the issue of victim status.

<<5584.53;5592.67;en>>
The court's case law on this has been clarified by the judgment in Zakharov, and the Zakharov criteria are clearly satisfied in this case.

<<5592.67;5603.53;en>>
It is in fact known and accepted that two of the parties before the court, that's Amnesty International and the Legal Resources Centre, were victims of interception under bulk interception powers.

<<5603.53;5616.01;en>>
And the other applicants are at a genuine risk of being victims in a similar fashion, given their global public interest activities in the very broad range of persons and organisations with whom they are in contact.

<<5616.01;5625.77;en>>
And as I've explained, the risk of third party intercept data being obtained and used by the UK intelligence services is the same, or possibly broader.

<<5625.77;5630.93;en>>
We are talking about the same data being obtained, but simply by a different route.

<<5630.93;5637.81;en>>
And this is not a case where there are any adequate remedies available under domestic law, for all the reasons which Ms. Rose has mentioned and which are set out

<<5637.81;5645.11;en>>
in our written observations at paragraphs 165 to 71, and 181 to 197.

<<5645.11;5657.65;en>>
That leads me then to the issue of exhaustion of remedies, which is an entirely academic point in this case, because some of the parties before the court did seek to use the inadequate IPT procedures.

<<5657.65;5660.65;en>>
And for those who did not, I say three things.

<<5660.65;5671.69;en>>
They relied on the Kennedy observations, which were the law at the time the application was introduced, set out in 166 of our consolidated submissions.

<<5671.69;5682.81;en>>
It would undermine legal certainty for the court to close its doors at this very late stage to the applicants who came here relying on its clear jurisprudence.

<<5682.81;5694.73;en>>
In any event, given that some parties did go to the IPT, the court can be satisfied that the concerns expressed in Kennedy were well-founded, as illustrated by the procedures in this case.

<<5694.73;5701.57;en>>
And those proceedings also illustrate that we would still be here, even if all the applicants had pursued that remedy first.

<<5701.57;5705.61;en>>
And I therefore invite you to hold that there is no exhaustion issue.

<<5705.61;5708.57;en>>
All the applicants have complied with the court's requirements in that respect.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<5712.39;5714.23;en>>
Thank you for your submissions.

<<5714.23;5720.59;en>>
I now invite the judges of the chamber wishing to do so to put their questions to the parties.

<<5720.59;5725.79;en>>
Judge Koskelo please.

[[Judge;Pauliine Koskelo]]

<<5730.23;5732.71;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<5732.71;5747.15;en>>
I would like to pose three questions or questions on three different aspects of the case.

<<5747.15;5751.43;en>>
The first one relates to interception.

<<5751.43;5781.11;en>>
Now, I understand that in order for this interception to, bulk interception to operate, there must be in place a permanent technical facility or gateway which is installed in the fiber optic cable system, which permits the intelligence services to access transmission flows in a direct manner.

<<5781.11;5789.91;en>>
And of course, we understand that this interception facility may be activated on the basis of a warrant.

<<5789.91;5804.07;en>>
What I would like to ask is who controls the actual, let's say, activation or deactivation of the connection to the interception facility?

<<5804.07;5813.59;en>>
That is to say, who activates and deactivates the actual flow of communications toward interception?

<<5813.59;5824.63;en>>
Are the intelligence services themselves directly in charge of, let's say, turning the interception facility on and off?

<<5824.63;5829.39;en>>
Or is there some other intervening body at this stage?

<<5829.39;5843.03;en>>
The second question regarding the interceptions phase that I would like to pose concerns cloud services.

<<5843.03;5872.59;en>>
So is it correct to assume that documents, photos, et cetera, which are saved in a cloud service that is based outside the UK would be regarded as an external communication for the purposes of the RIPA regime, RIPA 8.4 regime?

<<5876.27;5895.83;en>>
My second line of questions is about the interception and my questions concern the warrant and the certificate that are required for the 8.4, the RIPA 8.4 regime.

<<5895.83;5914.19;en>>
Now, I note that the applicants in their joint submissions, paragraphs 120 to 122, argue that, in fact, there is a rolling program of indefinite authorization in place.

<<5914.19;5917.03;en>>
And this argument is based on two things.

<<5917.03;5925.55;en>>
The first point is that the bulk interception warrant can be renewed without any limits.

<<5925.55;5933.07;en>>
It has a limited duration, but it can be renewed without any definite limits.

<<5933.07;5949.31;en>>
And the second point they make is that the ISC has reported that only a single certificate has ever been issued, a single certificate expressed in very general terms.

<<5952.27;5965.87;en>>
In other words, what the applicants, as I understand, contend is that there is, in fact, sort of a continuous recycling of a standard kind of warrant and a standard kind of certificate.

<<5965.87;5973.63;en>>
Now, I would like to know if the government is able to confirm or refute this or to offer any other comments.

<<5978.35;5994.51;en>>
And the third issue I would like to address are the safeguards that are applicable after the interception.

<<5994.51;6016.67;en>>
Now, we understand that the data which will be included in the index of documents that will be available, potentially available for examination by a human analyst, that data is identified through the application of simple selectors and more complex search terms.

<<6020.39;6048.51;en>>
We also note, however, that in a report from 2015, the Intelligence and Security Committee of the Parliament noted that from the evidence we have taken, it appears that neither ministers nor the commissioners have any significant visibility on the selection and the application of the simple selectors or the search terms that are deployed.

<<6051.23;6075.67;en>>
And I also understand that it is the case that the selection for human examination of the content of communications is carried out by the analysts themselves, who will be in charge of conducting the examination.

<<6075.67;6082.83;en>>
That is to say that the analysts themselves are also in charge of determining the criteria for selection.

<<6085.55;6090.51;en>>
Now, I would like to raise two questions in this context.

<<6090.51;6109.67;en>>
Would it be possible to explain to us which are the safeguards that are in place in relation to the selection and the application of the selectors and the search terms that are applied to the data once it has been intercepted?

<<6113.39;6145.99;en>>
And also, secondly, what are the safeguards in place to ensure that data which is not selected for examination and is due to be discarded, that such data might be subject to analysis with a view to identifying potential communication patterns, which could be of intelligence value?

<<6145.99;6157.03;en>>
So which are safeguards applying to the data which is retained but not selected for human examination?

<<6163.19;6188.11;en>>
In this context, I also note that or assume that as regards the filtering criteria and the selectors, there is a possibility for the commissioner and possibly the other supervisory organs to conduct an exposed review or supervision.

<<6188.11;6213.79;en>>
But is there any body that is empowered to issue any binding instructions or orders regarding the selectors or filtering mechanisms that are used or may not be used?

<<6213.79;6233.35;en>>
So is there any sort of more robust regime for controlling the kind of selectors that are, in fact, applied, given that in the first place, it is a matter for the analysts to determine the selectors?

<<6233.35;6234.75;en>>
So these would be my questions.

<<6234.75;6234.75;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<6236.6;6239.62;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge Harutyunyan.

[[Judge;Armen Harutyunyan]]

<<6246.26;6247.26;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<6247.26;6253.46;en>>
I have one question, which is addressed to the government.

<<6253.46;6284.78;en>>
When considering the general safeguards in relation to the destruction of intercepted material, as soon as it is no longer, I am quoting, necessary for any of the authorized purposes provided by the section 15.3 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, and section 15.4 provides the relevant definition of the term necessary for the authorized purpose.

<<6284.78;6296.34;en>>
This includes the rather broad reference to retention being necessary if, and again I quote, it is likely to become necessary.

<<6296.34;6305.06;en>>
What safeguards, if any, are there to limit and or supervise the application of this criteria?

<<6305.06;6305.1;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<6308.04;6309.34;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<6309.34;6309.34;en>>
Judge Eicke, please.

[[Judge;Tim Eicke]]

<<6311.76;6313.28;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<6313.28;6315.04;en>>
I have three questions.

<<6315.04;6326.88;en>>
The first is turning to the safeguards relating to related communications data intercepted under a Section 8-4 warrant, which Mr. Eadie explained again this morning.

<<6326.88;6335.12;en>>
And we've seen in the written observations that the safeguards provided by Section 16 of the Act don't apply.

<<6335.12;6360.32;en>>
And of course, the submission is, as I understand it, that they don't apply, at least in part, because if they were to apply, it would be more difficult or impossible to make the Section 16 safeguards work for content data, in that it would make it more difficult or impossible to determine whether material was, in fact, referable to an individual known to be in the British Isles.

<<6360.32;6385.64;en>>
If one, however, looks at the definition of communications data set out in Chapter 2 of the 2015 Acquisition and Disclosure of Communications Data Code of Practice, can the government explain to us why any other than the most basic traffic data would be required in order to ensure that the Section 16 safeguards can be applied effectively?

<<6385.64;6392.24;en>>
And secondly, what safeguards are there to ensure that any communications data are not necessary for this purpose?

<<6392.24;6406.68;en>>
And I'm thinking particularly of service use information or subscriber information, insofar as that's captured, is, in fact, discarded and or is only otherwise used in a manner compatible with the requirements of the Convention.

<<6406.68;6419.96;en>>
The second question relates really to a factual clarification, I hope, of the reading of the Interception Code of Practice, the 2016 version.

<<6419.96;6431.56;en>>
Looking at the protection of journalistic sources under Article 10, could you confirm whether paragraphs 4.28 to 4.31 of that code

<<6431.56;6455.64;en>>
are said also to apply to confidential journalistic material, despite the clear distinction drawn in paragraph 4.26 between confidential journalistic material on the one hand and confidential personal information on the other, and the apparent limitation of those paragraphs to, I quote, confidential personal information, end quote, or quote, confidential information, close quote?

<<6455.64;6469.0;en>>
And finally, the applicants made no oral submissions this morning in relation to the complaint under chapter 2, in relation to chapter 2, section 22 of RIPA.

<<6469.0;6473.04;en>>
Could I just ask for confirmation whether that continues to be pursued?

<<6473.04;6473.04;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<6476.7;6478.68;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge Pardalos.

[[Judge;Kristina Pardalos]]

<<6482.02;6484.22;en>>
I have a question for the government.

<<6484.22;6519.22;en>>
Staying briefly with Chapter 12 of the Interception Code, is it the government's case that paragraph 12.5 of the 2016 Code addresses the concern expressed by the IPT in paragraph 53 of its December 2014 judgments, and I quote from the judgment, there ought to be introduced a procedure whereby any such request, a request in absence of a RIPA warrant, if made when referred to the Secretary of State, must address the issue of Section 16.3?

<<6519.22;6519.22;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<6522.07;6524.05;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<6524.05;6524.05;en>>
Judge Turković, please.

[[Judge;Ksenija Turković]]

<<6528.5;6544.38;en>>
I would like to ask a question related to acquisition of communications data that is regulated in Chapter 2 of RIPA, which sets out the framework under which public authorities may acquire communications data from CSPS.

<<6544.38;6549.18;en>>
And I'm asking that question to the government.

<<6549.18;6571.9;en>>
The three questions related to that issue that were not sufficiently dealt with in submissions and are related to how the regime that is envisaged in Chapter 2 is actually satisfying the requirements of being in accordance with the law and or necessity.

<<6571.9;6604.42;en>>
In particular, when we consider the large number of relevant public authorities and or purposes, the lack of independence of the designated person, and the apparent absence of any guidance related to the examination disclosure other than to the third states, acquisition and or destruction of communications data.

<<6604.42;6611.56;en>>
This is the question related to Chapter 2, as I have said.

<<6611.56;6636.98;en>>
Also in terms of the admissibility, the government is proposing that we should deviate from the conclusions that we have taken, that the Court has taken in the Kennedy judgment, suggesting that IPT proceedings now represent sufficient remedy.

<<6636.98;6643.66;en>>
Kennedy judgment was based on burden versus UK.

<<6643.66;6656.42;en>>
Is the government suggesting that IPT is representing better guarantees than the regular courts in the UK?

<<6656.42;6667.18;en>>
Or is the government suggesting that in general we should not adhere to burden versus UK anymore?

<<6667.18;6676.78;en>>
And could government substantiate in more details why we should do that?

<<6676.78;6684.3;en>>
How many times IPT made suggestions to the Parliament and the Parliament followed that?

<<6684.3;6697.04;en>>
And could you explain, is this what you are suggesting in accordance with the sovereignty of the Parliament and is following that doctrine?

<<6697.04;6707.14;en>>
So we have heard the question related to the warrant and for how long the warrant and whether the warrant could be actually extended indefinitely.

<<6707.14;6711.58;en>>
The same question goes for the retention of data.

<<6711.58;6721.6;en>>
There are limits for the retention of data, but it seems that the retention could be prolonged indefinitely.

<<6721.6;6731.22;en>>
So how that could be justified.

<<6731.22;6764.9;en>>
And then, I don't know whether you can say that, but actually all the connections that are going on under the surveillance or we know that some of the connections are not under the surveillance through which internet is going.

<<6764.9;6781.22;en>>
And then, if the warrant is issued for national security purposes, could the data later on be reviewed for other purposes that are identified in law?

<<6781.22;6788.38;en>>
And is the purpose of economic well-being in accordance with the Convention standards?

<<6788.38;6789.38;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<6791.57;6793.05;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<6793.05;6803.05;en>>
I would like to ask also a couple of questions, beginning with a follow-up to what Judge Tukovic has just said about non-exertion.

<<6803.05;6830.05;en>>
We are aware that the court considered in Kennedy, especially in paragraph 109, that, and I quote, the applicant was not required to advance his complaint regarding the general compliance of the RIPA regime for internal communications with Article 8, paragraph 2, before the IPT in order to satisfy the requirement under Article 35, para 1, that he exhaust domestic remedies.

<<6830.05;6832.41;en>>
This has been said in 2010.

<<6832.41;6839.45;en>>
The two first applications concerned were lodged in 2013 and 2014.

<<6839.45;6851.81;en>>
Could the government specify the changes between 2010 and 2013, 2014, that would justify to rule otherwise in the present case?

<<6851.81;6862.65;en>>
My second question concerns, it is addressed to both parties, and it concerns the new legislative framework of 2016.

<<6862.65;6869.81;en>>
And my question is, to what extent can the court take into account the new provisions in this particular case?

<<6869.81;6877.89;en>>
And finally, I have a question to the government in relation to the intelligence sharing issue.

<<6877.89;6890.81;en>>
It appears that chapter 12 of the Interception Code of Practice sets out guidance concerning the requesting and handling unanalyzed intercepted communications from a foreign government.

<<6890.81;6893.45;en>>
This raises two issues.

<<6893.45;6905.65;en>>
Are there any rules or guidelines on when or whether the intelligence services can accept unsolicited material from a foreign government?

<<6905.65;6918.05;en>>
And B, the safeguards in chapter 12 only appear to be connected with material from a foreign government identified as intercepted communication.

<<6918.05;6934.29;en>>
However, the government also appears to have intercepted that, to have accepted that in this context, it is not always possible to distinguish clearly between material that is intercepted material and that which is not.

<<6934.29;6947.89;en>>
What safeguards are there in relation to material received from a foreign government which is not intercepted material and or in relation to which it is unclear?

<<6947.89;6963.01;en>>
So the court will now withdraw for 30 minutes, following which the parties will have 30 minutes each to submit brief observations in reply to each other's submissions and to reply to questions from the judges.

La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<7202.47;7203.41;en>>
Please be seated.

<<7211.91;7214.35;en>>
The hearing is resumed.

<<7214.35;7214.35;en>>
I call Mr. Eadie.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<7218.18;7220.54;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<7220.54;7224.34;en>>
I will try and focus on the numerous questions that have been asked.

<<7224.34;7227.26;en>>
The court is interested, it appears.

<<7227.26;7231.3;en>>
Can I start with Judge Costello's questions?

<<7231.3;7242.9;en>>
The first one related to and asked a technical question about how gateways on cables were activated and deactivated.

<<7242.9;7249.38;en>>
The answer, I think, to that question is that there is no independent body regulating that in the direct sense.

<<7249.38;7255.26;en>>
So the agencies tell the person operating the bearer that they have the warrant.

<<7255.26;7257.26;en>>
And they then turn it on and turn it off.

<<7257.26;7266.5;en>>
But there isn't independent oversight of that particular process, part of the process that's regulated effectively by the breadth and reach of the warrant.

<<7266.5;7272.26;en>>
In relation to cloud services, I'm very far beyond my pay grade in terms of how the technicalities of all this work.

<<7272.26;7277.66;en>>
But the documents held in the cloud are not, of course, communications.

<<7277.66;7286.7;en>>
So the only circumstance in which it would be interesting and live to examine that is in relation to the actual uploading of documentation onto the cloud.

<<7286.7;7295.78;en>>
And so far as that is concerned, the same constraints on selection and examination would apply as they apply to all other communications.

<<7295.78;7307.78;en>>
But it's as well, perhaps, to bear in mind that limit on the extent to which documents actually sitting in the cloud are or are not, as we suggest, communications.

<<7307.78;7316.66;en>>
The second raft of questions related to warrants and or certificates under section 8.4

<<7316.66;7328.1;en>>
and asked us to address more specifically the question of whether or not there is some form of rolling program or indefinite renewal without limits.

<<7328.1;7336.62;en>>
So far as warrants are concerned, those need to be renewed every six months.

<<7336.62;7344.98;en>>
The test, as you know, is a test that doesn't allow them to be renewed unless it's necessary and proportionate to do so.

<<7344.98;7359.78;en>>
And for that purpose, can I refer you to the 2016 code, paragraphs 6.22 to 6.24?

<<7359.78;7364.26;en>>
So that's the first part of the question that you asked on that front, which related to the warrants.

<<7364.26;7370.5;en>>
You also asked a question about certification and whether or not there was a single certificate.

<<7370.5;7375.58;en>>
The answer to that question is there is in a technically there is a single certificate.

<<7375.58;7387.62;en>>
And as you know, the function of the certificate is to describe the particular national security objectives that need to be pursued in relation to this regime.

<<7387.62;7394.62;en>>
But although there is technically a single certificate, it also is kept up to date and regularly reviewed.

<<7399.74;7407.14;en>>
Not surprisingly, it might be thought, because national security concerns and objectives change over time.

<<7407.14;7420.48;en>>
And again, if I can simply give you a reference without going to it, in the code itself, the 2016 code, see if you would, sorry, paragraph 6.14.

<<7420.48;7445.98;en>>
The third roster of questions asked by Judge Cascillo turned on the safeguards, or asked about the safeguards, on the selection and search terms that were used by analysts and referred to the Intelligence and Security Committee report of 2015.

<<7445.98;7451.38;en>>
So far as that is concerned, I think my answer to that is twofold.

<<7451.38;7457.46;en>>
Firstly, by reference to 7.15 of the code,

<<7457.46;7474.22;en>>
analysts who are using the databases and searching them in accordance with the search terms I identify are required to be trained and are required to justify every access, every examination that is made.

<<7477.66;7486.62;en>>
The standard that is there set out and that exists in the legislation anyway is that it's got to be necessary and proportionate for the examination in question to be made.

<<7486.62;7499.66;en>>
And that control and that test would operate to constrain not merely the actual basic access itself, but the manner in which that access was sought.

<<7499.66;7505.3;en>>
In other words, it would operate to control the search terms themselves.

<<7505.3;7509.02;en>>
7.16 of the code also makes clear,

<<7509.02;7522.34;en>>
and this is the second part of the answer, that analysts who do examine material in that way are obliged to create records of how and why they've done it.

<<7522.34;7548.26;en>>
And the purpose of that is the obvious one, which is to create an auditable record, which of course feeds into the oversearch regime and the commissioner's role and his ability to determine whether or not particular selected instances were or were not necessary and proportionate, and to take steps if not and to approve if so, as it were.

<<7548.26;7558.3;en>>
I think Judge Koskelo's questions on search terms broke down, if I understood it correctly, into specific search terms on selected material.

<<7558.3;7562.26;en>>
And then the question was, well, what happens to the remainder of the material?

<<7562.26;7566.02;en>>
And what about pattern searching and matters of that kind?

<<7566.02;7570.26;en>>
I think my answer to that is that the same pretty much applies.

<<7570.26;7571.7;en>>
It is permissible.

<<7571.7;7586.98;en>>
Indeed, it is one of the critical parts of the functioning of this sort of data and its utility that untargeted searches, by which I mean searches not, for example, by reference to particular names, can be run.

<<7586.98;7588.26;en>>
You're looking for patterns.

<<7588.26;7591.34;en>>
You're looking for seed information and to develop.

<<7591.34;7598.54;en>>
That is the very purpose of the use of these sorts of this sort of material.

<<7598.54;7600.14;en>>
So those patterns can be run.

<<7600.14;7606.62;en>>
But in the same way, if you're going to run pattern searches, they have to be justified as necessary and proportionate.

<<7606.62;7614.46;en>>
And in the same way, a record would have to be created so as to facilitate and enable proper oversight by the commissioner.

<<7622.82;7638.26;en>>
And I think that also answers the final part of that question, which is, is there any independent body who can issue, as it were, some binding instruction about filtering or search terms?

<<7638.26;7641.1;en>>
Are there any set criteria?

<<7641.1;7646.62;en>>
Does the safeguarding, as it were, have that degree of fixed or set architecture in it?

<<7646.62;7648.46;en>>
Does it have that skeleton of safeguarding?

<<7648.46;7654.74;en>>
And the answer to that is that there aren't any set rules of that kind that apply to analysts.

<<7654.74;7676.74;en>>
But that, in my respectful submission, is not necessarily or at all a vice of the system or a necessary part of it if one recognizes, as one must, that whatever search terms they use have to be justified as necessary and proportionate and have to be the subject of a record so that they can be overseen.

<<7676.74;7699.86;en>>
And so although there aren't, as it were, set structural limitations on the nature of search terms, in particular because the flexibility is truly necessary to enable the interrogation to perform its useful function, they still have to justify against that standard, the convention standard, and they still have to create records so that others can oversee.

<<7699.86;7733.38;en>>
And of course, to come to the final bit of it, if commissioners, in conducting their auditing function, were to come across, for example, regular use that they considered was inappropriate of particular types of search term or examination, the mechanisms by which that was done, if they were to consider that to be inappropriate in a general sense, for example, then the commissioner has all the constitutional mechanisms that exist to enable them to draw matters to the attention, for example, of the prime minister.

<<7733.38;7745.1;en>>
And you know that under the legislative regime, commissioners are obliged to and can report to the prime minister about any of the findings that they make.

<<7745.1;7756.54;en>>
And so in the hypothetical example that I've given where they're not satisfied with the way in which searching is done, for example, there are mechanisms for elevating that.

<<7756.54;7759.18;en>>
And if appropriate, change would then need to be made.

<<7759.18;7767.58;en>>
And of course, those sorts of concerns, this is where the mechanisms for oversight overlap.

<<7767.58;7776.22;en>>
If that example were to occur, the commissioner could report to the prime minister or could draw it to the attention of the agency in question.

<<7776.22;7779.58;en>>
And if they didn't react, report to the prime minister at the next stage.

<<7779.58;7783.82;en>>
That sort of formal report wouldn't only be known to the prime minister.

<<7783.82;7797.14;en>>
If you had the sort of challenge in a general sense, which is permissible to be made to the IPT, the IPT is very well aware of the nature of the commissioner reports that are made from time to time.

<<7797.14;7806.74;en>>
And so as it were, there is an additional and possible remedial route to control an additional safeguarding element building in.

<<7806.74;7815.54;en>>
That's why I described these protections, including oversight, as multilayered in my initial submissions.

<<7815.54;7824.18;en>>
Judge Harutyunyan asked questions about destruction of data when no longer necessary.

<<7824.18;7837.74;en>>
And specifically, I think if I understood the question correctly, zoomed in on the words likely to become necessary in section 15.4 of RIPA

<<7837.74;7840.58;en>>
and asked about safeguarding in relation to that.

<<7840.58;7861.42;en>>
So far as that is concerned, again, sorry to give you references into the code time and again, but the code deals with retention periods, including in particular default retention periods in paragraph 7.8 and 7.9.

<<7861.42;7868.26;en>>
Difficult, of course, and sets out default retention periods after which the thing must be destroyed.

<<7868.26;7879.9;en>>
Difficult to see how one could retain unselected material on the basis that it would be likely to become necessary, because that phraseology inevitably requires a judgment.

<<7879.9;7883.14;en>>
And the judgment is perhaps the obvious one.

<<7883.14;7897.5;en>>
Parliament evidently envisaged that certain material, in relation to certain material, it might be possible to say it is necessary to retain this, because it corresponds to or meets a particular national security need.

<<7897.5;7913.38;en>>
But no doubt the draftsman of RIPA then thought, well, hang on a second, what happens if we end up in a situation where the material in question, there may be a difficulty with demonstrating current necessity, but at any minute now it's likely to be.

<<7913.38;7934.14;en>>
Perhaps the critical safeguard in relation to all of this again comes back to that combination of IPT and particularly commissioner, because if there is a judgment call made about likelihood, and I think the specter that you were positing was an unacceptable judgment too far out in terms of likelihood.

<<7934.14;7936.98;en>>
That's what prompted, I think, the safeguarding question.

<<7936.98;7945.98;en>>
The answer to that, commissioner can review, and if interested in that area, would no doubt make his views known.

<<7945.98;7957.3;en>>
But the statutory test that is required is one of likelihood to become necessary, subject, of course, as I say, to the default periods in the code and all the description of how that destruction works.

<<7957.3;7967.58;en>>
But I don't think there's anything more in terms of actual written down code or safeguarding than features in the wording of the legislation itself.

<<7967.58;7968.78;en>>
So that's that question.

<<7968.78;7974.7;en>>
Then Judge Aiki, who mercifully, whose third question is directed to the applicant, so I can leave that on one side.

<<7974.7;7978.18;en>>
But the first two appear to be directed at us.

<<7978.18;7988.78;en>>
And the first of them related to the safeguards relating to related communications data, section 16 not applying.

<<7988.78;7996.58;en>>
And the question was, why not, as it were, restrict it to a basic type of traffic data?

<<7996.58;7999.5;en>>
And what about service and subscriber data?

<<7999.5;8016.82;en>>
I think the short answer to that, leaving aside the difficulties in relation to modern communications of trying to categorize data as traffic data, at least as a category of basic or complex, by and large, that's quite a difficult distinction and would be quite a difficult distinction to operate.

<<8016.82;8028.94;en>>
But the core, I think, answer to that question is that the only related communications data that would be obtained through intercept is traffic data.

<<8028.94;8034.98;en>>
You don't get service user or subscriber data through interception.

<<8034.98;8037.3;en>>
So that's the answer to that first question.

<<8037.3;8052.9;en>>
The second question asked, focused on the 2016 code that I've been giving you lots of references to, and focused in particular on paragraphs 4.28 to 4.31,

<<8052.9;8065.62;en>>
drawing attention to the difference between confidential personal information and confidential journalistic information, a difference that appeared, I think, from 4.26.

<<8065.62;8072.94;en>>
And going back to it, I confess I hadn't spotted that or thought about it before, mea culpa, mea culpa.

<<8072.94;8087.86;en>>
But I think the position is, as far as we can tell, that that, although it's entirely right to draw attention to the linguistic oddity, it would be a surprising construction of a document which, of course, isn't to be construed as a statute, but is to be construed as a code.

<<8087.86;8101.9;en>>
It would be an odd thing, indeed, if the particular safeguarding mechanisms, which I think concerned the provision or the writing down or the recording of reasons in 4.28, I think it was,

<<8101.9;8107.94;en>>
those didn't apply broadly to include confidential journalistic material.

<<8107.94;8114.18;en>>
So it's no part of my case to say that it doesn't include that, despite the odd, and I shall accept odd, difference of language.

<<8119.38;8131.86;en>>
Judge Pardalos asked a question about chapter 12 and asked the question whether paragraph 12.5

<<8131.86;8141.94;en>>
of the code was intended to address the concern of the investigatory powers tribunal recorded at paragraph 53 of their judgment.

<<8141.94;8144.18;en>>
And my answer to that can be mercifully short.

<<8144.18;8144.7;en>>
It is yes.

<<8147.5;8171.02;en>>
Judge Turkovich then asked questions in relation to a rather different and complex set of issues arising out of communications data and chapter 2 and asked a series of questions about the potential adequacy or otherwise of the safeguarding regime under that chapter.

<<8171.02;8177.14;en>>
With the greatest respect, that is a big topic to start trying to address in the context of this hearing.

<<8177.14;8188.7;en>>
It does not apply, we respectfully submit in our, in relation to these applications, which are about 8-4 interception and foreign liaison sharing regimes.

<<8188.7;8201.82;en>>
Chapter 2 is about the possible access that other public authorities or that public authorities might have to obtain information from CSPs direct, as it were.

<<8201.82;8205.58;en>>
It's a wholly different set of issues, a wholly different subject matter.

<<8205.58;8212.66;en>>
It's been considered again and again in the context of the Davis and Watson or the Watson litigation in front of the CJU.

<<8212.66;8214.54;en>>
But it isn't our situation.

<<8214.54;8225.06;en>>
Public authorities of the kind identified in the question don't have access to intercepted material or foreign liaison shared material held by the agencies.

<<8225.06;8227.5;en>>
It's just a fundamentally different regime.

<<8227.5;8242.46;en>>
And as I say, if you genuinely are interested in that set of issues, even though they don't arise in relation to these applications, then we'd have to do more than me trying to re-argue Watson on my feet in the five or so minutes that remain.

<<8242.46;8255.58;en>>
And that would need to be the subject of, no doubt, an intense debate of the kind that we will also, no doubt, need to have on the re-referred questions back to the Luxembourg court following the IPT's latest judgment.

<<8255.58;8261.78;en>>
But my short answer to Judge Turkovitz's first question is, careful, careful.

<<8261.78;8263.86;en>>
It's a fundamentally different regime.

<<8263.86;8266.34;en>>
And it's not this application.

<<8266.34;8278.34;en>>
A question was then asked, and I think the president also asked a question about, well, what's changed in relation to admissibility in relation to Kennedy and Burden and all of that?

<<8278.34;8290.66;en>>
Burden was, of course, principally focused on the question of Section 4 of the Human Rights Act and declarations of incompatibility and how all of that works.

<<8290.66;8303.74;en>>
And we drew attention in our opening submissions to the France and the United Kingdom case, which is the latest word from the section of the court dealing with the IPT and its utility.

<<8303.74;8327.74;en>>
But my submission is that the IPT has shown itself to be an effective remedy, a body that should, under the subsidiarity principle, be turned to in order for the domestic authorities to have the opportunity to sort an argued or alleged convention violation so as not to need to trouble this court.

<<8327.74;8335.3;en>>
And when it came to this court, you would have the benefit, as you do in this case, of a considered domestic judgment having thought through, at least initially.

<<8335.3;8342.46;en>>
You may or may not agree with them ultimately, but you would have the benefit of their judgment on the very convention issues.

<<8342.46;8347.14;en>>
So we do respectfully submit that the IPT has shown itself to be effective.

<<8347.14;8354.78;en>>
And in part, that is because of the work that it does and its jurisdiction and the nature of the judgments that it has produced.

<<8354.78;8372.3;en>>
And in part, it is because the government has shown itself to be uniformly and universally responsive to adverse judgments or to suggestions, indeed, from the IPT.

<<8372.3;8382.7;en>>
Parliament, of course, hasn't yet needed to get involved in the sense of producing revised primary legislation in answer to a ruling by the IPT.

<<8382.7;8384.9;en>>
So to that extent, I entirely accept.

<<8384.9;8388.58;en>>
One doesn't have, as it were, the primary legislative track record.

<<8388.58;8396.94;en>>
But what one does have is, as I say, a uniform and universally responsive reaction from government.

<<8396.94;8402.98;en>>
And to the extent that Parliament has needed to be involved, for example, in approving codes and so on, it has been.

<<8402.98;8427.06;en>>
And as good an example as any, it might be thought, is chapter 12 of the 2016 code itself, which, as you will have seen, was a, as it were, a statutory codification of the disclosure that is quoted at paragraph 47 of the IPT's first judgment in these proceedings.

<<8427.06;8439.94;en>>
Judge Turkovic, sorry to revert to her questions, asked a question about warrants and how long they can be extended and asked the same question in relation to the retention of data.

<<8439.94;8442.94;en>>
Could it be a prolonged or an indefinite retention?

<<8442.94;8450.34;en>>
Again, I think I've given the answer to that, which is see paragraph 7.8 and 7.9 of the code, which

<<8450.34;8460.46;en>>
make it plain that this is not in any shape or form and could not properly be characterized as an indefinite retention of data regime.

<<8460.46;8464.18;en>>
She then asked a question about whether we are dealing here with all connections.

<<8464.18;8469.06;en>>
Are all connections under surveillance or are some not?

<<8469.06;8471.7;en>>
And the answer to that is some not.

<<8471.7;8478.5;en>>
Only a small proportion are available and only a small proportion are visible.

<<8478.5;8500.3;en>>
Perhaps the best reference I can give you in relation to that, which deals directly with this question of the limit on the access, which is why I said in my examination of the nature of the interference, you've got to take it in stages, a bit like the reverse pyramid, to actually get down to the real substantive interference in these sorts of cases.

<<8500.3;8513.32;en>>
But the best reference I can give you to explain that bit of it, how many connections are available, is in the Anderson Bulk Powers Review, which you have in your bundle behind tab something.

<<8513.32;8515.18;en>>
Give you the tab number in a moment.

<<8515.18;8518.46;en>>
Paragraph 2.5.

<<8518.46;8520.22;en>>
Let me just double check.

<<8520.22;8521.98;en>>
2.15, I think.

<<8521.98;8526.58;en>>
2.15.

<<8526.58;8527.38;en>>
Yeah.

<<8527.38;8528.1;en>>
So it's tab 50.

<<8528.1;8528.6;en>>
Yeah.

<<8528.6;8530.12;en>>
Tab 50 in your bundles.

<<8530.12;8537.68;en>>
And the relevant paragraph is 2.15.

<<8537.68;8549.38;en>>
Judge Turkovich's final question related to whether or not if a warrant was issued for national security purposes, the data could be reviewed for other purposes.

<<8549.38;8551.34;en>>
I'll come to economic well-being in a moment.

<<8551.34;8558.34;en>>
Answer to the first part of that question is, yes, there is specific permission to do it, for example, in relation to serious crime.

<<8558.34;8568.36;en>>
There are a variety of different legislative provisions that allow that to be done, including, I think, a bespoke provision in the Counterterrorism Act, Section 19.5, but also the base provisions that

<<8568.36;8577.52;en>>
govern, the base legislative provisions that govern what the agencies can and cannot do and the purposes for which they can and cannot act.

<<8577.52;8590.38;en>>
But the answer to the first basic part of the question, can they do it for one, get it for one purpose, look at it for another, answer yes, but still limited to the statutory purposes which they're allowed to operate under.

<<8590.38;8598.48;en>>
The second part of that little question was to do with the potential breadth of economic well-being.

<<8598.48;8611.42;en>>
And the short answer to that is that in relation to that concept, you will have seen and no doubt recognized its derivation in paragraph 2 of Article 8.

<<8611.42;8626.14;en>>
But in relation to the domestic regime, so far as relevant, it is even more limited than that, because the concept of economic well-being for present purposes is economic well-being that are related to national security.

<<8626.14;8630.3;en>>
So there's that combination, that combined concept that is used.

<<8630.3;8638.82;en>>
And you get that from the code, 2016 code at paragraph 3.5.

<<8638.82;8648.9;en>>
And you also get it from RIPA itself in section, give me one moment, I'll get you the section.

<<8648.9;8650.14;en>>
I'll get you the section, but it's in there.

<<8650.14;8658.26;en>>
We'll have to make sure you've got the right version of RIPA because it was the subject of an amendment to make exactly that link so that the concept was composite.

<<8658.26;8667.02;en>>
It's in section 5.3 of the primary legislation itself.

<<8667.02;8677.34;en>>
The president then asked a series of questions.

<<8677.34;8684.06;en>>
The first one was related to admissibility, and I don't want to go back on any answers I've given in relation to that.

<<8684.06;8687.38;en>>
The second one related to the new legislative framework.

<<8687.38;8696.18;en>>
I mentioned it in my submission, as you recall, the 2016 Act and the relevance of that for the purpose of these proceedings.

<<8696.18;8704.62;en>>
My submission is that that new legislative framework is not relevant for the purpose of your consideration.

<<8704.62;8710.62;en>>
To some extent, it's always jolly tempting, and my friend Ms. Rose was unable to resist the temptation,

<<8710.62;8716.1;en>>
to say, well, if you can do it that way in a later piece of legislation, that must demonstrate that you could have done it that way earlier.

<<8716.1;8725.62;en>>
But the answer to that, it might be thought, if that is truly the relevance, reliance that is placed upon it, is careful, careful, because her submission was also that the world has changed.

<<8725.62;8743.26;en>>
And it is entirely appropriate in a world which changes as rapidly in terms of the technological advances as R1 does, for Parliament to have a review of the subject matter more generally, to devise a set of different and bespoke rules.

<<8743.26;8755.46;en>>
That does not lead, and couldn't possibly lead, in a context as complex as this, to, as it were, the binary conclusion that because you now do it that way, it must have been deficient beforehand.

<<8755.46;8776.46;en>>
The critical question, I respectfully submit, which doesn't turn on the nature or detailed provisions of that new Act, is whether or not the safeguards that my learned friend sought to identify as being, as having been forever necessary in order to comply with Article 8, are truly such.

<<8776.46;8780.34;en>>
Are they really necessary for the purpose of ensuring adequate safeguarding?

<<8780.34;8788.46;en>>
In other words, the ones that were not in the old regime are under RIPA and following, and the code, and all the below-the-waterline arrangements, and all of that.

<<8788.46;8798.02;en>>
And if, and to the extent that she was saying that others were, like ex post facto notification, would that cause a drama?

<<8798.02;8811.66;en>>
Would that cut across the paradigm need, as we submit it to be, for the agencies to conduct their work to seek to protect the public against an ever-increasing national security and terrorist threat?

<<8811.66;8812.86;en>>
So that's the question.

<<8812.86;8825.66;en>>
So one can see why reference is made to it, but we respectfully submit that it would be almost impossible for this court to try to get, as it were, that sort of comparative exercise going in a legitimate and useful way.

<<8825.66;8830.02;en>>
I fully accept that sometimes that places the government in a jolly difficult position.

<<8830.02;8835.1;en>>
If it's a single, short, little issue, and you've changed it, and there's no reason why you couldn't have done it before.

<<8835.1;8843.74;en>>
When you're dealing with something this big, my respectful submission is that it's irrelevant.

<<8843.74;8846.06;en>>
So that is that.

<<8846.06;8863.1;en>>
Then in relation to intelligence sharing and the chapter 12 guidance, the first of the sub-questions, I think in relation to that from the president, were whether or not there were rules or guidance on unsolicited material.

<<8863.1;8876.62;en>>
And so far as that is concerned, again, my first answer is to urge a little bit of caution, because we are dealing here with material which is in the nature of intercept material from the foreign government.

<<8876.62;8895.02;en>>
And it might be thought to be implausible and extraordinarily rare, if it ever occurred, for such material to be provided on any basis which was not solicited, or at least the subject of an initial request from the foreign liaison partner saying, are you interested in this?

<<8895.02;8913.62;en>>
So we are cautious about seeking to get into, and we haven't addressed in any great detail in our observations, the sorts of rules and guidelines that might apply in that different context, if ever unsolicited material of a more general kind were to be provided.

<<8913.62;8930.02;en>>
I think the base answer, if one goes there, just so that it doesn't sound as though we have no answer, the base answer, I suspect, would very much focus on the constraints that exist in the base domestic legislation governing the activities of these agencies.

<<8930.02;8933.5;en>>
You know that the Intelligence Services Act of 1994 exists.

<<8933.5;8937.46;en>>
You know that the Security Service Act of 1998, or whenever it was, exists.

<<8937.46;8947.62;en>>
And those constrain both the obtaining and the disclosure of material, save for limited purposes and save unless necessary and proportionate.

<<8947.62;8954.3;en>>
So those base statutory safeguards are already built into the legislative regime.

<<8954.3;8959.86;en>>
Beyond that, in relation to pure unsolicited material, I'm afraid I'm not able to assist without more.

<<8959.86;8966.74;en>>
But it may well be that there are other provisions that I would wish to refer to where I want to get into that area.

<<8966.74;8971.82;en>>
But caution, caution, we respectfully urge in relation to that.

<<8971.82;8987.3;en>>
Then the final question was what safeguards there were, or were there safeguards only in relation to intercepted material, and what safeguards there were in relation to other material.

<<8987.3;8990.74;en>>
Again, I think the same answer, I would give the same answer.

<<8990.74;8998.78;en>>
Not really this case, but if and to the extent necessary, the base governing pieces of legislation govern.

<<9001.86;9005.38;en>>
That, I hope, I'm sorry, it's been a bit of a whistle stop tour.

<<9005.38;9007.14;en>>
But there have been a large number of questions.

<<9007.14;9012.54;en>>
My only friend was out sipping her coffee with her feet on the table.

<<9012.54;9017.46;en>>
But can I very briefly make a couple of points in relation to reply?

<<9017.46;9020.62;en>>
Firstly, my only friend, Ms. Rose,

<<9020.62;9029.46;en>>
acknowledges, as she says in rigging terms, the security threat, doesn't seek to minimize it, and then moved on.

<<9029.46;9033.02;en>>
That, we respectfully submit, is not good enough.

<<9033.02;9039.1;en>>
You can't turn up and simply assert that you are not minimizing the security threat.

<<9039.1;9055.02;en>>
There was no attempt to grapple with the very specific problems that we sought to identify with the specific safeguards that they assert need to be in place in order for their regime to be properly protective and safeguarded against Article 8.

<<9055.02;9062.26;en>>
And unless you are able to grapple with that, it isn't good enough simply to turn up and say, well, I acknowledge the security threat.

<<9062.26;9064.16;en>>
Anyone can do that.

<<9064.16;9068.1;en>>
Some bodies, however, actually have to deliver that.

<<9068.1;9086.9;en>>
And if safeguarding cuts across their ability to do that, or has the potential in a serious way to do that, then that at least calls into the most serious question whether this convention would require, with its overall balances I indicated, would require those safeguards to be imposed.

<<9086.9;9096.86;en>>
So far as the next thrust of her submissions is concerned, they were principally directed to communications data.

<<9096.86;9104.3;en>>
And what she asserted was the lack of safeguarding in relation to communications data.

<<9104.3;9112.66;en>>
So far as that is concerned, we do not accept that the position is as she asserts.

<<9112.66;9127.7;en>>
We have referred in relation to the basic test to be applied in our observations at paragraph 160 to the Malone case and to the other cases under this court's jurisprudence, which acknowledge that safeguarding is a context-specific issue.

<<9127.7;9133.18;en>>
You don't simply apply a uniform set of tests and then say, well, there it is.

<<9133.18;9135.18;en>>
That's what's required in all contexts.

<<9135.18;9149.94;en>>
And communications data are different in terms of the broad degree of their intrusion and the interference that they entail, if any, with Article 8 rights to, for example, content.

<<9149.94;9161.9;en>>
They're also very different because, as is evident, they lie, to some extent, at the heart of the ability of agencies to conduct non-targeted searching.

<<9161.9;9175.62;en>>
And we would refer in relation to that and to the importance of that sort of material and to the inability to know which, as it were, individuals you are needing to select or to examine for that purpose.

<<9175.62;9182.02;en>>
By definition, you don't know that when you're dealing with bulk data and its interrogation of this kind.

<<9182.02;9190.38;en>>
And we refer you, if we may, to two paragraphs only in the IPT's judgment referring matters back to the CJEU.

<<9190.38;9205.94;en>>
And those are paragraphs 15, 15, and 16, which refer to specific evidence on this very issue and the difficulties of seeking to devise some different regime that the IPT fully and clearly acknowledge.

<<9205.94;9217.1;en>>
But we, as a base point, do not accept, indeed, we deny the suggestion that there is insufficient protection of related communications data.

<<9217.1;9226.38;en>>
There are safeguards that apply at the point of obtaining, see our observations, paragraphs 174 to 176, only for narrow purposes.

<<9226.38;9231.34;en>>
Got to be national security in our context, only if necessary and proportionate.

<<9231.34;9238.86;en>>
There is safeguarding at the point of access, again, only if necessary, only if proportionate, only for specified purposes.

<<9238.86;9249.58;en>>
And one derives those from the combination of the base statutes governing the agency's activity, the Security Service Act and the Intelligence Services Act.

<<9249.58;9252.38;en>>
One derives it from section 6 of the Human Rights Act.

<<9252.38;9257.22;en>>
And one derives it from section 15 of RIPRA and chapter 7 of the code.

<<9257.22;9261.26;en>>
So there are serious limits at that point also.

<<9261.26;9269.9;en>>
Considerable emphasis was placed, if I'm an only friend, on the disparity in terms of safeguarding between section 16 and section 15.

<<9269.9;9285.42;en>>
But the reality is that in relation to CD, the safeguards that already exist are more than sufficient, we respectfully submit, to conform to the requirements of the convention.

<<9285.42;9289.34;en>>
Finally, on the 8.4 Amos Rose's submissions,

<<9289.34;9303.18;en>>
there was a sustained attack, both in the observations and orally, on the effectiveness of the actual oversight provided by the commissioners, and particularly in relation to the inspection regime that they operate.

<<9303.18;9307.54;en>>
That, we respectfully submit, is both an unfair and an unfounded criticism.

<<9307.54;9316.42;en>>
And we would invite you to consider just two documents in that respect for the detail, the thoroughness, and the effectiveness of that regime.

<<9316.42;9322.38;en>>
The first is the general report that is at tab 35 of your bundles from Sir Anthony May.

<<9322.38;9339.9;en>>
And secondly, and specifically to do with the inspection regime, describing what is done, describing how the process is undertaken, describing the detail which is applied, see the 2015 report from Sir Anthony, tab 36 of your bundle, paragraph 6.46,

<<9339.9;9341.9;en>>
and following.

<<9341.9;9342.98;en>>
So that's the commissioner.

<<9342.98;9363.5;en>>
So far as the IPT itself is concerned, there appears to be a surprising, and we respectfully submit, thoroughly unworthy attack on the independence of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, chaired as it was by two high court judges and three other distinguished lawyers in our case.

<<9363.5;9380.78;en>>
The idea that on reading the three liberty privacy judgments, anyone could sensibly say that this tribunal had not conducted a thorough and independent examination of the relevant safeguarding regime, we respectfully submit is untenable.

<<9380.78;9394.7;en>>
Finally, in relation to Miss Mountfield's side of the case, intelligence sharing, her basic submission was in terms that there are, as she put it, no safeguards in relation to that regime.

<<9394.7;9398.62;en>>
That is, with the greatest respect to her, simply wrong.

<<9398.62;9407.14;en>>
It ignores the disclosure, with a capital D, that you've seen recorded in paragraph 47 of the IPT's December judgment.

<<9407.14;9410.5;en>>
It ignores the code that that became in chapter 12.

<<9410.5;9417.1;en>>
It ignores the Padfield principle, the public law controlling principle, that is referred to in that code.

<<9417.1;9440.34;en>>
And it ignores the fact that the basic section 15 safeguards, in fact, apply in that situation, bringing with it, alongside the base statutes that control the agency's activities and the HRA itself, the necessity and proportionality standards that lie absolutely at the core of this protective regime.

<<9440.34;9441.98;en>>
For all of those reasons, Mr. President,

<<9441.98;9449.98;en>>
we repeat our invitation at the end of my opening to declare these applications inadmissible, or to find in our favor on the merits.

<<9449.98;9456.3;en>>
I'm sorry I've taken a little time, but I suspect that the vast majority of questions were directed in my direction.

<<9456.3;9457.46;en>>
So I hope you'll forgive me.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<9459.05;9460.57;en>>
Thank you very much. I call now Mrs. Rose and Mrs. Mountfield please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<9465.58;9491.14;en>>
Mr President, members of the court, it's been apparent, having heard Mr Eadie's submissions and in particular having heard his responses to the questions posed by the members of this court, that essentially the Government's case amounts to saying this, trust us and we'll keep you safe.

<<9491.14;9515.7;en>>
It is clear that what my learned friend refers to as safeguards are simply provisions that say that the officials of the agencies must themselves make a judgement when they're deciding what material to collect, what material to keep, what material to search and what material to examine.

<<9515.7;9524.06;en>>
That they must make the judgement as to what search terms are appropriate, how long it should be kept, what is proportionate for them to do.

<<9524.06;9533.18;en>>
The reality is that there is no independent mechanism which can hold them accountable for that judgement.

<<9533.18;9542.54;en>>
And that in the context of what we now know to be this enormous database of private material.

<<9542.54;9574.92;en>>
It is as if we had a situation in which the DNA database that was the subject of SNMARPA or the fingerprint database were being held in secret by the police forces of the United Kingdom or France and the police officers were saying, well we will judge what material we need to hold and when it's proportionate for us to search it without any external controls.

<<9574.92;9577.88;en>>
And the problem is obvious.

<<9577.88;9586.0;en>>
One doesn't have to suggest, and I don't suggest that officials of the intelligence services are acting in bad faith.

<<9586.0;9606.1;en>>
But the difficulty is that institutions have a culture and have a natural predisposition to consider that things that they want to do and things that they can do are things that it is necessary and proportionate for them to do.

<<9606.1;9623.84;en>>
And that is why in order for there to be any real and effective protection for rights under Article 8 and Article 10, there must be some proper, rigorous, independent form of external control to hold these officials to account.

<<9623.84;9638.92;en>>
And we say that all of the answers that you've just been listening to in a range of different contexts such as communications data, periods of retention and so on, take you back to that central floor.

<<9638.92;9642.96;en>>
So their cases trust us to keep you safe.

<<9642.96;9661.28;en>>
Our cases have a legal framework to ensure that when carrying out their important functions, these public authorities are doing no more than is truly proportionate and are only using these very intrusive powers when they're necessary.

<<9661.28;9665.84;en>>
My learned friend says, oh well, Ms Rose mentioned the threat, but then she moved on.

<<9665.84;9668.64;en>>
With respect, I really didn't.

<<9668.64;9680.56;en>>
What I said was the threat is important, but the threat does not render the United Kingdom immune from the standards that apply under the convention.

<<9680.56;9692.94;en>>
One of the important ways in which our democracies resist the threats that they encounter is to reaffirm and to continue to protect our fundamental rights, including the right to privacy.

<<9692.94;9705.84;en>>
If we simply surrender all of that to the judgment of individual officials inside these secret agencies, then we have already lost the important battle that we are fighting.

<<9705.84;9727.56;en>>
To come to some more specific points in relation to the question of the cloud and whether material uploaded to the cloud would constitute an external communication, the answer given by Mr Eadie was a fascinating one, not least because of its lack of clarity and its evasiveness.

<<9727.56;9744.2;en>>
As far as I understood him, he said, well, we think material that's held on the cloud would not be a communication, but that it might be or would be a communication when it was uploaded to the cloud.

<<9744.2;9755.0;en>>
Now we find that a very strange answer in the light of the provisions of section 2, subsection 7 of RIPA, which is the definition section.

<<9755.0;9761.28;en>>
And section 2.7 says that for the purposes of this section, the times while a communication

<<9761.28;9781.4;en>>
is being transmitted by means of a telecommunications system shall be taken to include any time when the system by means of which the communication is being or has been transmitted is used for storing it in a manner that enables the intended recipient to collect it or otherwise have access to it.

<<9781.4;9791.6;en>>
And on that basis, it is strange to see why my learned friend seeks to distinguish between uploading material to the cloud and material being stored on the cloud.

<<9791.6;9799.78;en>>
Now we don't know the answer to that question because we don't know how the agencies actually interpret these provisions.

<<9799.78;9815.12;en>>
But that, we say, is an excellent example of the opacity and the difficulty of even understanding what powers the agencies claim to arrogate to themselves under this legislation.

<<9815.12;9824.36;en>>
And in relation to the question of rolling warrants, my learned friend refers to the fact that each warrant must be limited to six months.

<<9824.36;9829.84;en>>
But he doesn't dispute that after the six months, the warrants can simply be renewed.

<<9829.84;9844.96;en>>
So the reality is that there is no dispute to our allegation that there can be, and we would say there are, under this legislation, simply rolling warrants that are renewed at regular six-month periods.

<<9844.96;9856.0;en>>
Then in terms of the, in relation to the question of search terms, and here we have a classic example of my learned friend's trust us and we will keep you safe analysis.

<<9856.0;9865.76;en>>
We know that the commissioners do not have visibility of the search terms that are used.

<<9865.76;9869.28;en>>
That is not a criticism of the commissioners.

<<9869.28;9875.44;en>>
My learned friend says, oh, it's quite improper for Miss Rose to seek to criticize these wonderful commissioners.

<<9875.44;9887.12;en>>
The problem is that they cannot possibly, they cannot possibly supervise the activities of the agencies because there is simply such a vast amount going on and their resources are so limited.

<<9887.12;9903.06;en>>
As the court will recall, I said in my submissions this morning, and you see it in paragraph 71 of the government's own submissions, a total of 15 person days per year devoted by the commissioners to inspection and audit.

<<9903.06;9907.6;en>>
When you are looking at these vast databases of material, simply impossible.

<<9907.6;9912.24;en>>
We know as a matter of fact that they don't have visibility of the search terms.

<<9912.24;9919.08;en>>
We also know, of course, that the terms of the certificate are extremely broad and general.

<<9919.08;9929.6;en>>
In reality, there is no constraint on the breadth of the search terms that may be being used except the judgment of the individual analyst selecting the search term.

<<9929.6;9934.38;en>>
That is the central problem with this regime.

<<9934.38;9938.4;en>>
The same problems occur in relation to the length of retention.

<<9938.4;9946.8;en>>
Now my learned friend points to some provisions in the 2016 Code, in particular paragraph 7.8 and 7.9 of the Code.

<<9946.8;9952.36;en>>
Now we have a difficulty with him relying on the 2016 Code at all, which I'll come back to.

<<9952.36;9959.84;en>>
But leaving that point aside, when you read the provisions of 7.8 and 7.9 together, and

<<9959.84;9965.52;en>>
read those provisions together with what is said in section 15.4 of RIPA that says you

<<9965.52;9973.64;en>>
can keep material that's likely to be useful in the future, the reality is there is no constraint.

<<9973.64;9987.08;en>>
Two years' retention is simply the normal period of retention, but there is no external scrutiny and there is no binding provision that forces destruction at any time.

<<9987.08;10002.36;en>>
Everything always loops back to the same question, the judgment of the analyst who thinks the data is necessary to keep.

<<10002.36;10014.32;en>>
Journalistic material, tab 33 again, this is the Code again and it's paragraphs 4.28

<<10014.32;10018.3;en>>
to 4.31.

<<10018.3;10031.36;en>>
I just want to make this point, which is that it is not clear from the Code whether the definition of journalistic material covers the confidential sources who approach human rights NGOs at all.

<<10031.36;10038.36;en>>
And of course in many cases these will be potential whistleblowers or potential victims of human rights violations.

<<10038.36;10055.64;en>>
The confidentiality of their approaches is absolutely critical, but it's not clear whether they are even covered by the safeguards such as they are in the 2016 Code.

<<10055.64;10058.52;en>>
We were asked some specific questions.

<<10058.52;10063.24;en>>
We were asked the question whether we maintain the case under section 22.

<<10063.24;10065.2;en>>
The answer is that we do.

<<10065.2;10083.62;en>>
I don't seek to add to what we say about it in our written observations, but all of the submissions in our written observations are maintained in relation to section 22, that is paragraphs 146 to 160 of those observations.

<<10083.62;10092.56;en>>
We were also asked by the President about the relevance of the new legislation and I would add to that the 2016 Code.

<<10092.56;10096.32;en>>
Now my learned friend's position on this is entirely contradictory.

<<10096.32;10112.32;en>>
He says the 2016 Act is irrelevant, but then he says we want to try to cure the obvious defects in the regime as it was when these claims were brought by relying on the later Code that was introduced in 2016.

<<10112.32;10114.48;en>>
We say he can't do that.

<<10114.48;10134.76;en>>
We say that the correct position is that this Court is being asked to rule on the compliance of the United Kingdom's arrangements with the relevant articles of the Convention as at the date that the applications were brought and on the facts and the state of national law as it was at that time.

<<10134.76;10163.38;en>>
The relevance of subsequent provisions is only in the sense that I've used them, which is a different sense, not to say whether or not the UK can now rely on them to show compliance ex post facto, but to show that in fact it can't be said that the defective forms of protection with which this application is concerned were the maximum that could potentially be provided because the United Kingdom has itself sought to go further subsequently.

<<10163.38;10181.28;en>>
Now we also say of course that the Code is clearly defective and I've just pointed out some of the reasons why, but we say that my learned friend cannot maintain in the same breath that the 2016 Act is irrelevant and then base his case fundamentally on the Code.

<<10181.28;10191.76;en>>
In relation to the question of the threat, my learned friend says, well, we haven't grappled with the damage that the safeguards we seek to apply would do to national security.

<<10191.76;10193.0;en>>
We absolutely have.

<<10193.0;10210.76;en>>
I specifically made the point in relation to notification ex post facto that it might not be possible in many cases, but the problem with the United Kingdom's legislation is it's not permissible in any case, even where there's no conceivable harm to national security.

<<10210.76;10220.3;en>>
And it's in that context that the IPT cannot provide an effective remedy because nobody has any idea that there's been any breach of their rights.

<<10220.3;10236.44;en>>
So far as the crucial safeguard of prior independent judicial authorization is concerned, it is not even contended by the United Kingdom that that safeguard would cause any harm to national security.

<<10236.44;10240.76;en>>
It's not suggested it would harm national security.

<<10240.76;10251.2;en>>
Finally in relation to the IPT, my learned friend says, oh, how outrageous of Miss Rose to suggest that these very eminent judges lack independence.

<<10251.2;10257.48;en>>
My Lord, it's nothing to do with the quality of the judgments that they have produced.

<<10257.48;10266.24;en>>
The question is simply whether in fact they operate in a way that is institutionally independent of the agencies.

<<10266.24;10294.36;en>>
And for a court to hold a secret meeting with one of the parties to the claims that it is due to here, and in the course of that meeting to agree with that party a protocol for disclosure which is to the advantage of that party, and which is not then disclosed to the other parties, that we say shows a lack of independence.

<<10294.36;10300.5;en>>
Unless I can be of any further assistance, those are our submissions in reply.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<10302.03;10318.57;en>>
Just in relation to Judge Koskelo's questions on the IPT, what has changed about the IPT's powers between Kennedy and the hearings in this case in 2013 and 2014?

<<10318.57;10320.29;en>>
Nothing.

<<10320.29;10331.49;en>>
Is the IPT a more effective remedy than national courts in relation to applications for declaratory relief concerning violations of the convention?

<<10331.49;10332.73;en>>
No.

<<10332.73;10343.81;en>>
Is the government's case that the IPT in this case constituted an effective remedy an attack on this court's decision in burden?

<<10343.81;10343.85;en>>
Yes.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<10349.67;10351.23;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<10351.23;10353.91;en>>
We have now come to the end of the hearing.

<<10353.91;10359.07;en>>
I thank the parties for their submissions and answers to the Court's questions.

<<10359.07;10363.39;en>>
The Court will now deliberate on the admissibility and merits.

<<10363.39;10366.55;en>>
The judgment will be delivered later.

<<10366.55;10370.33;en>>
The parties will be informed of the date of delivery.

<<10370.33;10370.33;en>>
I declare the hearing closed.

La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<67.88;68.78;en>>
Please be seated.

<<81.97;90.29;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of Selahattin Demirtaş versus Turkey, number two.

<<90.29;102.63;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on 20 February, 2017, under Article 34 of the convention by a Turkish national, Mr. Selahattin Demirtaş.

<<102.63;112.33;en>>
The application was allocated to the second section of the court pursuant to Rule 52, paragraph 1 of the rules of court.

<<112.33;119.45;en>>
A chamber of the second section delivered its judgment on 20 November, 2018.

<<119.45;146.13;en>>
It unanimously declared admissible the applicant's complaints concerning Article 5, paragraph 1, as to the alleged lack of reasonable suspicion, Article 5, paragraph 3, Article 5, paragraph 4, as to the alleged lack of a speedy review before the constitutional court, Article 18 of the convention, and Article 3 of Protocol Number 1.

<<146.13;154.49;en>>
It declared further complaints under Article 5, paragraphs 1 and 4 inadmissible by a majority.

<<154.49;172.49;en>>
The chamber found unanimously that there had been no violation of Article 5, paragraph 1, and of Article 5, paragraph 4 of the convention, and that there had been a violation of Article 5, paragraph 3 of the convention, and of Article 3 of Protocol 1.

<<172.49;182.89;en>>
It held by six votes to one that there had been a violation of Article 18 of the convention in conjunction with Article 5, paragraph 3.

<<182.89;194.37;en>>
It also found unanimously that there was no need to examine separately the admissibility and merits of the applicant's complaint under Article 10 of the convention.

<<194.37;212.05;en>>
Finally, the chamber held unanimously that the respondent state had not failed to comply with its obligations under Article 34 of the convention, and that it was to take all necessary measures to put an end to the applicant's pretrial detention.

<<212.05;231.97;en>>
On 19 February 2019, both the government and the applicant requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the convention, and the panel of the Grand Chamber accepted the request on 18 March 2019.

<<231.97;248.03;en>>
The Council of Europe Commission of Human Rights exercised her right under Article 36, paragraph 3 of the convention, and Rule 44, paragraph 2 of the rules of court, to intervene in the proceedings and submitted written comments.

<<248.03;254.81;en>>
On 20 August 2019, she informed the court that she would take part in the hearing.

<<254.81;268.77;en>>
Moreover, written comments were submitted to the court by the Inter-Parliamentary Union and jointly by the non-governmental organization Article 19 and Human Rights Watch.

<<268.77;280.89;en>>

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<418.27;421.59;en>>
Dear Mr. President, dear members of the court,

<<421.59;425.03;en>>
today we provided you with a number of visual aids.

<<425.03;432.47;en>>
My colleagues will indicate their relevance throughout the submission.

<<432.47;435.87;en>>
Dear Mr. President, dear members of the court,

<<435.87;440.37;en>>
the legal question before you today is a simple one.

<<440.37;445.75;en>>
Has the Republic of Turkey, when it deprived Mr. Demirtas of his liberty

<<445.75;456.23;en>>
on the 4th of November 2016, and every single day after that, violated the European Convention on Human Rights.

<<456.23;459.93;en>>
Mr. Demirtas is a human rights lawyer by profession.

<<459.93;468.03;en>>
He dedicated much of his legal career to fighting impunity for gross human rights violations in Turkey.

<<468.03;474.71;en>>
But today it is he who needs defending from a violation of his rights.

<<474.71;477.97;en>>
The case of Mr. Demirtas is before you today

<<477.97;486.49;en>>
because he is a Kurdish left-wing politician who stands in strong opposition to the government of Turkey.

<<486.49;492.93;en>>
This case, therefore, is not merely about the deprivation of liberty of Mr. Demirtas.

<<492.93;501.33;en>>
It's not merely about the violations of his rights to political speech and political representation.

<<501.33;515.71;en>>
This case is also about how the European Court of Human Rights detects and responds to the use of judiciary to silence and punish political opposition in Turkey.

<<515.71;519.15;en>>
Mr. President, at the heart of this case

<<519.15;521.39;en>>
is the fact that Mr. Demirtas has been deprived

<<521.39;528.69;en>>
of his liberty for political purposes and that the judiciary has been used to serve these purposes.

<<528.69;541.27;en>>
It is, therefore, necessary that we lay out the context with respect to the case file before you and how the 31 separate investigations have been included in this case file.

<<541.27;546.17;en>>
For that, I must start in 2015.

<<546.17;554.45;en>>
Before 2015, no pro-Kurdish political party in Turkey had ever exceeded the 10 percent election threshold.

<<554.45;558.15;en>>
This is the highest election threshold in Europe.

<<558.15;561.05;en>>
Things started to change when Mr. Demirtas became

<<561.05;566.47;en>>
the co-president of the HDP in 2014.

<<566.47;569.49;en>>
Mr. Demirtas and his politics were inclusive,

<<569.49;577.21;en>>
democratic and rights-based, and strongly committed to the peaceful resolution of the Kurdish question.

<<577.21;585.39;en>>
From 2013, he was also a central mediator in the peace talks that the government initiated.

<<585.39;588.39;en>>
When the Turkish electorate welcomed Mr. Demirtas

<<588.39;600.07;en>>
in the June 2015 general elections, HDP well exceeded the 10 percent election threshold by receiving 13.1 percent of the votes,

<<600.07;607.73;en>>
winning 80 seats in the Turkish parliament, and becoming the second largest opposition party in Turkey.

<<607.73;622.65;en>>
This was the first time in the 92-year history of the Turkish Republic that a political party with predominantly Kurdish left-wing politicians achieved representation at the capital.

<<622.65;639.17;en>>
Significantly, and due to this, dear members of the court, the AKP, the ruling party, lost its majority to establish a government in the parliament for the first time since 2002.

<<639.17;646.95;en>>
In the aftermath of the June 2015 elections, two significant events took place.

<<646.95;655.69;en>>
First, the peace talks that celebrated the climate of democratic debate in Turkey collapsed.

<<655.69;662.99;en>>
Second, President Erdogan started to target the HDP in general, and Mr. Demirtas in particular,

<<662.99;667.93;en>>
directly and openly as terrorists.

<<667.93;675.57;en>>
On 28 July 2015, President Erdogan stated, and I quote, we don't approve closing down political parties.

<<675.57;682.05;en>>
However, the deputies of the HDP should pay the price one by one.

<<682.05;690.39;en>>
Immediately after the speech, Turkish public prosecutors opened six investigations against Mr. Demirtas.

<<690.39;700.73;en>>
What is significant about these six investigations is the huge discrepancy between the alleged crimes, these are speeches of Mr. Demirtas,

<<700.73;704.17;en>>
and the dates of action of the prosecutors.

<<704.17;714.01;en>>
In some cases, these speeches go back to 1,000 days and more before the action of the prosecutors.

<<714.01;726.95;en>>
Despite this, the HDP passed the 10% threshold once again in the general elections of November 2015, sending 59 representatives to parliament.

<<726.95;729.67;en>>
The response to this was clear.

<<729.67;742.17;en>>
In a speech on 2 January 2016, President Erdogan demanded, and I quote, HDP MPs should go to prison.

<<742.17;752.71;en>>
Following this speech, 14 new criminal files were prepared against Mr. Demirtas in 10 different cities

<<752.71;757.29;en>>
in less than three months.

<<757.29;778.01;en>>
All in all, prosecutors succeeded to make 20 separate charges against the applicant, the leader of the second largest opposition party, based on what he said in and outside of parliament after the June 2015 election, after the speeches of Mr. President of the Republic,

<<778.01;781.75;en>>
and after the collapse of the peace process.

<<781.75;790.29;en>>
These 20 charges constitute 65% of the case file right in front of you today.

<<790.29;800.43;en>>
Now, you could ask, 31 minus 20, that leaves us with 11 other files in front of you.

<<800.43;810.27;en>>
Out of these 11 files, nine of these that were prepared before the elections were prepared by one prosecutor in Diyarbakir.

<<810.27;819.65;en>>
He's currently in pretrial detention himself for being a member of the Fetullahist terrorist organization.

<<819.65;831.43;en>>
Dear President, dear members of the court, let me now turn to the immediate facts surrounding our critical date, the 4th of November, 2016.

<<831.43;835.17;en>>
Only four days before Mr. Demirtas was arrested,

<<835.17;845.11;en>>
different prosecutors across Turkey, seemingly upon their own initiative, started to pass their criminal files about the applicant to Diyarbakir.

<<845.11;858.81;en>>
There is no plausible way to explain how nine different prosecutors transferred their files to Diyarbakir within the space of 96 hours without central instructions.

<<858.81;862.69;en>>
The Diyarbakir prosecutor then proceeded in a manifestly irregular way.

<<862.69;866.93;en>>
He joined 31 investigations.

<<866.93;873.93;en>>
We don't know why those 31 in any precise terms, into a single mega file.

<<873.93;878.13;en>>
That is the file that is right in front of you today.

<<878.13;886.91;en>>
These investigations also included files that do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Diyarbakir prosecutor.

<<886.91;898.43;en>>
In the early hours of the 4th of November, 2016, police raided the homes of HDP members of parliament, including the applicant, in four different cities.

<<898.43;915.65;en>>
Given that there was never an organized crime investigation, the only rational explanation for simultaneous multiple raids into homes of members of parliament is that these two were done under central instructions.

<<915.65;920.85;en>>
To sum up, Mr. President, the political success of the HDP

<<920.85;923.75;en>>
under the leadership of Mr. Demirtas

<<923.75;938.13;en>>
across the Republic of Turkey led to him being targeted openly as a terrorist by President Erdogan in his speeches after 2015 and after the collapse of the peace process.

<<938.13;945.03;en>>
Following this, 20 separate investigations were opened using political speeches of Mr. Demirtas

<<945.03;949.75;en>>
going back to four and three years in the past.

<<949.75;958.15;en>>
On 4th November, 2016, Diyarbakir judge detained Mr. Demirtas on grounds that he was a member

<<958.15;965.05;en>>
of a terrorist organization and that he incited to commit crimes.

<<965.05;1002.03;en>>
But on 11th of January, 2017, Diyarbakir prosecutor accused, and I must emphasize, Diyarbakir prosecutor accused the leader of the second largest opposition party in the country, the leader of a political party that had received over 10% of the votes in the last general elections with establishing or running a terrorist organization, a charge for which he was never investigated and a charge for which he was never detained.

<<1002.03;1004.99;en>>
Dear Mr. President, Mr. Altaparmak

<<1004.99;1008.31;en>>
will now respond to the preliminary objections of the government.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<1011.02;1012.74;en>>
I call Mr. Altıparmak.

[[Applicant;AP4]]

<<1017.7;1021.24;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<1021.24;1029.6;en>>
the first objection is that the IPU Human Rights Committee is an international dispute settlement mechanism under the convention.

<<1029.6;1044.6;en>>
This is the first time in the history of this court that an organization that was granted permission to intervene before the court as a third party intervener is put forward as an international dispute settlement body.

<<1044.6;1058.44;en>>
Esteemed members of the court, firstly, the procedure before the IPU is not based on an international treaty that engages the legal responsibility of the Republic of Turkey.

<<1058.44;1070.26;en>>
Turkey can never be a state party to the inter-parliamentary union, because quite simply, it is parliaments and not states that are its members.

<<1070.26;1079.7;en>>
Secondly, the activities of the IPU Human Rights Committee are neither judicial nor quasi-judicial in nature.

<<1079.7;1088.68;en>>
The committee, as laid out by its own rules, is there to defend parliamentarians and raise awareness to their plights.

<<1088.68;1096.62;en>>
Thirdly, the Human Rights Committee is a simple subcommittee of the inter-parliamentary union, not a quasi-judicial body.

<<1096.62;1108.66;en>>
Members of this committee are not appointed from outside the IPU and do not require any particular expertise in international human rights law.

<<1108.66;1114.42;en>>
Fourthly, this committee does not deliver final decisions on complaints.

<<1114.42;1120.98;en>>
Its work is simply that of ongoing examination.

<<1120.98;1129.9;en>>
This committee's decisions are not capable of legal effect, but merely and only political pressure.

<<1129.9;1142.86;en>>
Finally, the applicants made by the HDP to the IPU does not relate essentially to the same person, the same facts, and the same complaints of this current case.

<<1142.86;1155.1;en>>
When a simple email sent in June 2016 to initiate this complaint, none of the 55 deputies was detained, including the applicant.

<<1155.1;1162.34;en>>
Dear members of the court, the second set of objections concern exhaustion of domestic remedies.

<<1162.34;1168.62;en>>
The Turkish Constitutional Court delivered its judgment declaring detention of Mr. Demirtas lawful

<<1168.62;1172.94;en>>
on 21 December 2017.

<<1172.94;1181.94;en>>
In its judgment, the Constitutional Court addressed four primary issues essential to the merits of the case before you.

<<1181.94;1191.62;en>>
First, the Constitutional Court held that detention of Mr. Demirtas on 4 November 2016 was lawful.

<<1191.62;1202.28;en>>
It held that there was reasonable suspicion to detain him on grounds that he may have committed crimes and that there was a flight risk.

<<1202.28;1209.3;en>>
Second, the court did not address the claim of the applicant that the detention has a political purpose.

<<1209.3;1220.76;en>>
Third, the Constitutional Court did not find it necessary to examine the applicant's claim that his detention violated his freedom of speech as a politician.

<<1220.76;1233.48;en>>
Four, the Constitutional Court chose not to examine the applicant's claim that his right to take in parliamentary activities due to his detention had been violated.

<<1233.48;1242.64;en>>
These four issues are precisely the issues of merit that the applicant would like the Grand Chamber to decide.

<<1242.64;1245.12;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<1245.12;1252.08;en>>
this third set of objections are relating to developments after the delivery of the chamber judgment.

<<1252.08;1255.72;en>>
On 4 December 2018, Mr. Demirtas was

<<1255.72;1263.92;en>>
convicted from a separate charge of terrorist propaganda to four years and eight months of imprisonment.

<<1263.92;1280.8;en>>
On 2 September 2019, the trial court, which rejected all requests for the release of applicants for more than 2 and 1 1⁄2 years, decided that applicants could be released if not convicted of another crime.

<<1280.8;1290.28;en>>
The government now argues that these new developments are preliminary objections before you on two grounds.

<<1290.28;1296.96;en>>
The first is that the applicant no longer is a victim under Article 5.1c.

<<1296.96;1303.92;en>>
Second, as a released person, more domestic remedies are now available for him to exhaust.

<<1303.92;1305.96;en>>
We take this in turn.

<<1305.96;1318.3;en>>
First, the conviction of the applicant in a separate trial is not relevant to the fact that our applicant has been subject to an Article 5.10 Protocol 1, Article 3

<<1318.3;1323.64;en>>
violations for which all remedies have been exhausted.

<<1323.64;1334.74;en>>
This conviction is there because only one out of 19 prosecutors did not send its file to Diyarbakir prior to his arrest.

<<1334.74;1338.48;en>>
In one and only one charge, Mr. Demirtas

<<1338.48;1344.48;en>>
received the heaviest sentence ever passed for the spread of terrorist propaganda.

<<1344.48;1356.24;en>>
On the other hand, no single court until today has found that the detention of the applicant on 4 November 2016 was unlawful.

<<1356.24;1366.76;en>>
Second, the government argues that the applicant must bring a compensation claim under the Criminal Procedural Court to challenge his detention.

<<1366.76;1377.28;en>>
An assessment of whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is carried out with reference to the date on which the applicant was lodged with the court.

<<1377.28;1386.56;en>>
The compensation claim became available not on the date of the application, but almost a year after the chamber judgment.

<<1386.56;1397.52;en>>
In addition, when will the applicant be able to lodge his complaint to the court if the government's argument is accepted, dear members of the court?

<<1397.52;1403.84;en>>
Roughly 10 years after his detention in 2016?

<<1403.84;1406.68;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<1406.68;1423.36;en>>
the government also submits that remedies with respect to Article 5, Paragraph 3 have not been exhausted as there is a separate case pending before the Constitutional Court concerning the length of unlawful detention.

<<1423.36;1426.48;en>>
This is completely misleading.

<<1426.48;1437.72;en>>
In Buzacci versus Moldova, the Grand Chamber held that the condition of persistence of reasonable suspicion under Article 5.1c

<<1437.72;1447.04;en>>
should be synchronized with the requirement on the judicial officer to give relevant and sufficient reasons for detention.

<<1447.04;1459.44;en>>
If there are not relevant and sufficient reasons to detain a person at the initial detention, every day following it will be lengthy detention.

<<1459.44;1463.32;en>>
Mr. Demirtas, in his application to the Constitutional Court,

<<1463.32;1464.88;en>>
claimed that.

<<1464.88;1470.72;en>>
First, his detention was not based on a reasonable suspicion.

<<1470.72;1485.72;en>>
Second, relevant and sufficient reasons to justify his initial and continued pretrial detention did not exist on 4 November 2016 and every day after that.

<<1485.72;1491.32;en>>
And the Constitutional Court clearly responded one year after the initial detention.

<<1491.32;1494.88;en>>
It considered that there was a flight risk.

<<1494.88;1502.36;en>>
More petitions to the Constitutional Court in the court of his detention do not change this fact.

<<1502.36;1512.0;en>>
Dear members of the court, the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of a person is a continuing violation of the convention.

<<1512.0;1529.32;en>>
When detention is ongoing, this court has no option but to examine all legal issues concerning Article 5, including Paragraph 3, with a view to establish a breach, as it did in Nedim Şener and Ahmet Şık cases.

<<1529.32;1547.96;en>>
If the government's preliminary objection as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies is accepted by you, any future judicial oversight of an unlawful detention in Turkey by this court becomes effectively impossible.

<<1547.96;1568.56;en>>
Future governments will be able to freely detain any opposition member for as long as they wish, convict them for another crime, release them, and demand applicants to either apply for compensation or to lodge new constitutional complaints to the Constitutional Court.

<<1568.56;1582.84;en>>
This will not only be a very dangerous assault on the right to individual petition, but also an assault on the substantive convention safeguards against arbitration deprivation of liberty.

<<1582.84;1595.44;en>>
Dear President, dear members of the court, the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies cannot be interpreted as a trap for victims of convention violations.

<<1595.44;1618.04;en>>
The court must denounce the government's strategy of using the exhaustion of domestic remedies as a trap, in particular when the domestic courts, including the Constitutional Court, had an opportunity to offer effective remedies to the applicant on 70 separate occasions.

<<1618.04;1622.24;en>>
Now, Mr. Demir will deliver our observations

<<1622.24;1625.28;en>>
on the unlawful deprivation of liberty of the applicant.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<1627.84;1628.72;en>>
Mr. Demir.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<1633.47;1640.83;en>>
Dear President and distinguished members of the court, the detention of Mr. Demirtas has no legal basis.

<<1640.83;1656.12;en>>
A blanket and retroactive constitutional amendment to lift parliamentary immunities on 20 May 2016 has no precedent in the history of Turkish Parliament and under its constitutional law.

<<1656.12;1660.91;en>>
This amendment has not been reviewed by the constitutional court either.

<<1660.91;1671.97;en>>
The unlawfulness of this amendment has also been identified by the Venice Commission and the third party interveners, Article 19 and Human Rights Watch.

<<1671.97;1692.36;en>>
Dear members of the court, on 4 November 2016, the Arbacel judge put forward nine concrete grounds to form the basis of reasonable suspicion to detain applicant on account of two crimes, membership of a terrorist organization and incitement to commit a crime.

<<1692.36;1699.63;en>>
The first six grounds listed in the judgment cite political speech made by Mr. Demirtas.

<<1699.63;1713.79;en>>
Nowhere in the Arbacel judge's decision is there a single concrete, relevant, and sufficient reason as to how this speech advocated hatred, intolerance, and violence.

<<1713.79;1723.31;en>>
Until today, no court explained how speech of Mr. Demirtas were met clear and present danger test.

<<1723.31;1729.67;en>>
The seventh ground is the attendance of Mr. Demirtas at a public and lawful meeting in the Arbacel.

<<1729.67;1739.51;en>>
Attending a lawful meeting of a lawful organization cannot be the ground of reasonable suspicion in any rule of law legal order.

<<1739.51;1744.71;en>>
The eighth reason is a tweet that not tweeted by Mr. Demirtas.

<<1744.71;1747.59;en>>
It is used to allege that Mr. Demirtas incited

<<1747.59;1756.19;en>>
to commit crimes during the violence on the streets on 6 to 8 October 2014.

<<1756.19;1767.83;en>>
The tweet was sent by the Twitter account of the HDP executive council around 10 PM on 6 October 2014.

<<1767.83;1785.09;en>>
It called for peaceful protests in response to assault on the Syrian town of Kobane by the so-called Islamic State and attack on civilian population that qualified crimes against humanity by UN.

<<1785.09;1789.25;en>>
In this period, Mr. Demirtas spoke countless times

<<1789.25;1792.49;en>>
concerning the violence on the streets.

<<1792.49;1804.71;en>>
His conduct was consistently peaceful, warning the public with respect to possible provocation and bringing perpetrators to justice.

<<1804.71;1810.67;en>>
For example, on 9 October 2014, Mr. Demirtas stated, I quote,

<<1810.67;1814.95;en>>
I would like to openly underline that we condemn violence.

<<1814.95;1821.75;en>>
We and our people have full respect for the values, the flag, and the leader of this country.

<<1821.75;1825.91;en>>
Those who commit these ugly acts have nothing to do with us.

<<1825.91;1828.13;en>>
Everyone must know this.

<<1828.13;1830.71;en>>
However, Mr. President, no weight

<<1830.71;1837.11;en>>
was given to his peaceful and responsible conduct detaining him two years later.

<<1837.11;1844.47;en>>
Dear members of the court, the ninth reason is the number of investigations against the applicant.

<<1844.47;1854.47;en>>
A blanket reference to thousands of pages of political speech made by the applicant cannot satisfy safeguards under Article 5.

<<1854.47;1860.15;en>>
It makes what reasonable suspicion to commit crimes absolutely unforeseeable.

<<1860.15;1871.29;en>>
In the 68 decisions of the domestic court that follow, the discussion of reasonable suspicion to commit crimes become more and more abstract.

<<1871.29;1879.84;en>>
Courts did not offer any concrete reasons in addition to those provided in the judgment of 4 November 2016.

<<1879.84;1887.31;en>>
The chamber found, the chamber judgment found an Article 5.3 violation concerning this.

<<1887.31;1891.55;en>>
Mr. President, let me now turn to the review carried out

<<1891.55;1896.03;en>>
by the Constitutional Court and the assessment of the chamber.

<<1896.03;1908.88;en>>
In its judgment of 21 December 2017, the Constitutional Court introduced completely new range of reasons for the reasonable suspicion to detain Mr. Demirtas.

<<1908.88;1911.99;en>>
The chamber also follows suit.

<<1911.99;1922.91;en>>
One of these is a speech made in 2012 saying that those who bring peace deserve to have their status erected.

<<1922.91;1928.95;en>>
This is a political speech that falls clearly under the protection of Article 10.

<<1928.95;1936.59;en>>
It is used as a ground both by Constitutional Court and the chamber to justify detention.

<<1936.59;1941.51;en>>
One other so-called speech relies on the audio surveillance.

<<1941.51;1948.67;en>>
Until today, until this day, no verification of the surveillance took place.

<<1948.67;1957.59;en>>
I must emphasize, not one of these reasons listed above were part of the concrete reasons of initial detention.

<<1957.59;1967.99;en>>
If Constitutional Courts are permitted to introduce new grounds for the reasonable suspicion as basis for detention, they start acting as first instance courts.

<<1967.99;1971.49;en>>
And this is obviously not their role.

<<1971.49;1975.71;en>>
It is also against Article 5.1c of the convention

<<1975.71;1981.27;en>>
as recently underlined by Alparslan Altan versus Turkey.

<<1981.27;1984.79;en>>
Mr. President, the Constitutional Court judgment

<<1984.79;1988.39;en>>
has also huge omissions as to facts.

<<1988.39;1993.03;en>>
The peaceful conduct of Mr. Demirtas in October 2014,

<<1993.03;2009.84;en>>
and indeed in his whole political career, his central role in the peace talks between the government and the PKK from 2013 to 2015 are entirely omitted from the judgment.

<<2009.84;2016.31;en>>
We must underline that the chamber has also omitted these crucial facts.

<<2016.31;2033.36;en>>
Dear President, the list of nine points provided by the Diyarbakir judge for the detention of the applicant do not meet the threshold of information or facts that could satisfy an objective observer of a reasonable suspicion.

<<2033.36;2044.31;en>>
This detention order not only undermined Article 5 safeguards, but also his protections of political speech and political representation.

<<2044.31;2047.67;en>>
I now hand over Ms. Molloh to present Article 18.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<2049.71;2051.07;en>>
I call Mrs. Molu.

[[Applicant;AP3]]

<<2054.42;2066.38;en>>
Dear President, as we have shown, the actions of the Turkish public persecutors in indicting Mr. Demirtas and the actions of the judges detaining and trying him are based solely

<<2066.38;2072.3;en>>
on his political speech, political activities, and political identity.

<<2072.3;2078.0;en>>
Dear members of the court, Mr. Demirtas was not able to sit in Parliament as a representative

<<2078.0;2085.22;en>>
of the Turkish Republic between 4 November 2016 and 24 June 2018.

<<2085.22;2092.94;en>>
For 40% of his term as a member of Parliament, Mr. Demirtas was incarcerated.

<<2092.94;2107.08;en>>
He was not able to vote on any of the major legislative activities, hold the government to account, and was not able to take part in activities in particular during the constitutional change referendum and presidential election campaign.

<<2107.08;2114.72;en>>
His detention intervened simultaneously with his right to political speech and his right to political representation.

<<2114.72;2124.14;en>>
Neither of these violations was reviewed or taken into account by the Turkish Constitutional Court judgment with the exception of one dissenting judge.

<<2124.14;2132.48;en>>
In closing, we turn back to Article 18, without which none of these violations can be understood in their entirety.

<<2132.48;2146.16;en>>
According to the Grand Chamber, the proof of ulterior purpose under Article 18 follows from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear, and concordant inference or similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.

<<2146.16;2151.84;en>>
In the context of immediate facts surrounding the case, the Court assesses 1.

<<2151.84;2153.48;en>>
Temporal links, 2.

<<2153.48;2156.56;en>>
Fabrication of evidence, and 3.

<<2156.56;2160.84;en>>
Manifest irregularities as laid out by Mervaş Vili v. Georgia.

<<2160.84;2168.84;en>>
In the context of general state of affairs in the country, the Court asks whether the facts are part of a broader pattern.

<<2168.84;2172.76;en>>
Let us follow the Court's evidentiary standards step by step.

<<2172.76;2175.24;en>>
First, temporal inference.

<<2175.24;2180.24;en>>
In Mamadov v. Azerbaijan, the Court held that there was not any available explanation as

<<2180.24;2187.64;en>>
to the timing of the applicant's detention other than speeches by the government and the subsequent actions of the judicial authorities.

<<2187.64;2192.6;en>>
In the case of Mr. Demirtas, the Chamber did not follow this temporal link standard.

<<2192.6;2202.52;en>>
It found a violation of Article 18 in conjunction with Article 5, Paragraph 3, meaning that the ulterior purpose sometime after his initial detention.

<<2202.52;2212.56;en>>
However, the evidence we put before you clearly indicates to a crystallization of the political purpose having an influence on judicial actions in 2015.

<<2212.56;2218.7;en>>
In the aftermath of the HDP's election success in June, Mr. Demirtas was politically framed

<<2218.7;2220.44;en>>
as a terrorist.

<<2220.44;2230.6;en>>
As we have shown when we started, the temporal link between the speeches of President Erdogan calling for the criminalization of Mr. Demirtas and the exponential increase in indictments

<<2230.6;2235.36;en>>
against him leading up to his detention is clear proof of this.

<<2235.36;2238.4;en>>
Second, fabrication of evidence.

<<2238.4;2250.4;en>>
As we outlined in our written submission, all the evidence in the applicant's file, such as witnesses and the allegation that he took instructions from the PKK, is fabricated.

<<2250.4;2253.48;en>>
And the trial court confirmed that.

<<2253.48;2260.5;en>>
Mr. Demirtas is accused of running a terrorist organization without a single piece of direct

<<2260.5;2266.36;en>>
evidence being provided to prove how he is running such an organization.

<<2266.36;2269.12;en>>
Third, manifest irregularities.

<<2269.12;2288.14;en>>
Turkish judges, including the Turkish Constitutional Court, held that anyone who belongs to the HDP is potentially a terrorist and that meetings between the HDP representatives can be admitted as evidence of reasonable suspicion of terrorist activities.

<<2288.14;2295.84;en>>
We have provided you the list of names and titles of the HDP politicians who have labeled as terrorists by judicial authorities.

<<2295.84;2304.4;en>>
The trial court continues to refuse to verify whether the audio surveillance used to incriminate our applicant is real.

<<2304.4;2321.64;en>>
Dear members of the court, nine of the criminal files prepared between February 2011 to January 2013 were issued by persecutors who later were dismissed and charged with serious crimes such as being a member of a terrorist organization.

<<2321.64;2333.68;en>>
Yet, even the fabricated evidence and illegal phone taps that these dismissed persecutors have put into Mr. Demirtas' file remain to this day part of his trial against him.

<<2333.68;2338.24;en>>
This evidence was also used as reasons to detain Mr. Demirtas.

<<2338.24;2343.88;en>>
The Turkish Constitutional Court has paid no attention to this either.

<<2343.88;2352.14;en>>
Dear President, dear members of the court, let us conclude by manifest judicial irregularities shaped under political influence since the chamber judgment.

<<2352.14;2357.8;en>>
When the chamber decided on 20 November 2018 that the prolonged detention of Mr. Demirtas

<<2357.8;2364.6;en>>
was unlawful, the President of the Republic responded, I quote, it does not bind us.

<<2364.6;2368.64;en>>
We will make our counter move and finish the job.

<<2368.64;2374.68;en>>
He also labeled the European Court of Human Rights as a terrorist lover in his subsequent speech.

<<2374.68;2383.0;en>>
During this speech on 4 December 2018, Mr. Demirtas received the highest possible sentence,

<<2383.0;2392.28;en>>
four years and eight months, for terrorist propaganda relating to a speech he made five years ago in an appeal that was fast-tracked.

<<2392.28;2401.64;en>>
In none of the 88 terrorist propaganda cases you had decided against Turkey, you will see such a hefty imprisonment for terrorist propaganda.

<<2401.64;2408.12;en>>
Mr. President, dear distinguished members of the court, on 2 September 2019, the trial

<<2408.12;2411.9;en>>
court decided to release Mr. Demirtas.

<<2411.9;2418.4;en>>
Any decision to release any person from unlawful detention is a positive decision, of course.

<<2418.4;2434.52;en>>
However, here no objective observer can explain why this has happened now, only 16 days before his grand chamber hearing and after previous requests were refused 68 times.

<<2434.52;2441.2;en>>
The second part of Article 18 evidence concerns whether the violations form part of a broader pattern.

<<2441.2;2450.32;en>>
Dear members of the court, the applicant's case is part of a pattern curbing the rights of members of opposition and human rights defenders in Turkey.

<<2450.32;2460.84;en>>
Dear members, you can only be too aware of the case docket of the European Court of Human Rights as a significant number of pending judicial harassment cases coming from Turkey.

<<2460.84;2468.94;en>>
These come from members of opposition parties, academics, journalists and human rights defenders who oppose the government.

<<2468.94;2481.56;en>>
They too have been indicted or in detention relating to terrorism or other serious charges based on fabricated evidence or solely for their professional or political activities.

<<2481.56;2489.12;en>>
The president continues to target political opposition of all walks and judiciary continues to respond.

<<2489.12;2497.0;en>>
Just this summer, Istanbul mayor elections were renewed by the judiciary following the demands of the president and his party.

<<2497.0;2505.76;en>>
Three democratically elected and priority vetted mayors have been removed from their offices on terrorism charges only a month ago.

<<2505.76;2511.06;en>>
Charging opposition politicians with terrorism crimes has become the currency of the day in Turkey.

<<2511.06;2515.96;en>>
What happened to Mr. Demirtas happened to Ms. Kaftancioğlu who is the head of Istanbul

<<2515.96;2520.26;en>>
of the largest opposition party.

<<2520.26;2526.08;en>>
She won Istanbul and she was punished for terrorist propaganda just two weeks ago.

<<2526.08;2532.84;en>>
So the pattern continues at the huge expense of rule of law, democracy and human rights in Turkey.

<<2532.84;2537.88;en>>
In conclusion, dear president, dear members of the court, the unlawful detention of Mr.

<<2537.88;2543.68;en>>
Demirtas pursued a political purpose that has crystallized in 2015.

<<2543.68;2555.32;en>>
Even if he is released tomorrow, the volume of politically motivated cases pending, in investigations pending against Mr. Demirtas condemned him to live a life where he is under

<<2555.32;2558.36;en>>
constant risk of imprisonment.

<<2558.36;2572.68;en>>
The only way to vitiate this labyrinthine use of the judiciary for political ends is to recognize it and to call it out and to demand that an end is put to it.

<<2572.68;2577.56;en>>
This court was created to do just this.

<<2577.56;2592.76;en>>
Therefore we ask the court to dismiss the preliminary objections of the government and declare that Articles 5, 10, Protocol 1, Article 3 were violated and that Articles 5 and 10 were violated in conjunction with Article 18.

<<2592.76;2592.76;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<2597.28;2598.44;en>>
Thank you.

<<2598.44;2600.04;en>>
I call Mr. Açikgül.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<2606.41;2609.22;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<2609.22;2615.74;en>>
it is an honor to appear before you and to do so on behalf of the government of Turkey.

<<2615.74;2619.32;en>>
The government presentation is divided in two parts.

<<2619.32;2625.16;en>>
In the first part, I will offer some general comments on the applicants' written and oral submissions.

<<2625.16;2630.84;en>>
In the second part, Professor Talman will address the admissibility and the merits of the application.

<<2630.84;2635.82;en>>
Mr. President, having listened to counsel for the applicant,

<<2635.82;2643.01;en>>
you might have got the impression that this case is all about Turkish politics and not about the convention.

<<2643.01;2656.86;en>>
The applicants tried to portray this case as the ruling AK Party using the prosecutorial and judicial authorities of the state to stifle the political activities of the applicant and the HDP.

<<2656.86;2667.14;en>>
I would like to remind the court that the first investigation file concerning the applicant was submitted to Parliament in November 2007.

<<2667.14;2676.86;en>>
In fact, 45 investigation files had been submitted to Parliament before the end of the solution process in July 2015.

<<2676.86;2681.14;en>>
12 of them is subject matter of this application.

<<2681.14;2691.01;en>>
Thus, there is no connection between the criminal investigation of the applicant and the constitutional referendum or the presidential elections.

<<2691.01;2699.97;en>>
The lifting of immunity in May 2016 was by no means used by the AK Party against the applicant or the HDP.

<<2699.97;2710.01;en>>
In fact, the lifting of immunity was approved not just by the members of the AK Party, but had cross-party support.

<<2710.01;2720.05;en>>
Indeed, the HDP members of the Parliament themselves had asked for the lifting of their immunities in July 2015.

<<2720.05;2730.89;en>>
At the time when there were already 45 investigation reports against the applicant before Parliament, but the applicant did not mention about it.

<<2730.89;2749.22;en>>
The lifting of immunity was also not specifically aimed at 55 HDP members of Parliament, but affected 154 MPs, including 29 members of the ruling AK Party and 59 members of the main opposition party, CHP.

<<2749.22;2756.86;en>>
The chairs of both CHP and National Movement Party were among them as well.

<<2756.86;2771.6;en>>
The lifting of immunity did not just lead to the criminal conviction of HDP members, but also to the criminal conviction of 15 CHP members and five members of the ruling AK Party.

<<2771.6;2778.62;en>>
The number of investigation files with regard to the HDP also does not say anything about the judicial process.

<<2778.62;2798.86;en>>
The 518 investigation files with regard to HDP members resulted in 322 criminal cases, of which 180 cases were closed either because the accused was acquitted or because there was no ground to impose a sentence.

<<2798.86;2802.82;en>>
The figures with regard to applicants are also revealing.

<<2802.82;2812.76;en>>
Of the 17 criminal cases brought against him, he was acquitted in four cases, and in five cases, the criminal proceedings were suspended.

<<2812.76;2824.57;en>>
To date, there has been only one criminal conviction, and four cases are still pending before the court, including the case subject matter of this application.

<<2824.57;2827.49;en>>
Mr. President, the applicants also

<<2827.49;2832.62;en>>
call into question the independence and impartiality of the Turkish judiciary.

<<2832.62;2844.38;en>>
The government would like to bring to court's attention, for example, the case of two other HDP MPs who were investigated for some of the same offenses as the applicant.

<<2844.38;2853.1;en>>
In these two cases, the Constitutional Court ruled that the pretrial detention was unlawful for lack of strong suspicions.

<<2853.1;2871.53;en>>
In addition, in March of this year, the Constitutional Court found that the applicant's freedom of expression had been infringed on the ground that while he was in pretrial detention, he could not receive periodicals and awarded him non-pecuniary damages.

<<2871.53;2874.66;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<2874.66;2882.89;en>>
it is difficult for any party to argue a case where the other side misrepresents and distorts the facts.

<<2882.89;2889.82;en>>
The government does not accept any of the factual allegations made by the applicant in these proceedings.

<<2889.82;2892.93;en>>
There are too many issues to be raised in the short time available.

<<2892.93;2896.66;en>>
Let me just highlight two examples.

<<2896.66;2902.45;en>>
First, the applicant misrepresented the figures with regard to the Constitutional Court case law.

<<2902.45;2916.22;en>>
Initially, there were only 2,665 cases in 2016 and 7,191 cases in 2017.

<<2916.22;2926.34;en>>
Actually, these figures represent the number of the cases from these two years that were still open at the end of 2018.

<<2926.34;2934.26;en>>
In fact, in 2016, there were more than 101,000 cases before the Constitutional Court.

<<2934.26;2943.3;en>>
Similarly, in 2017, the overall case load was over 126,000.

<<2943.3;2950.89;en>>
Second, the applicant tries to create the impression of having condemned violence.

<<2950.89;2966.22;en>>
Of course, the applicant has paid lip service to nonviolence, while at the same time, he's calling for resistance, revolt, and protest by all means possible.

<<2966.22;2978.66;en>>
If I just may read out one of the applicant's interviews quoted by the Constitutional Court, of course, I don't mean violence by that.

<<2978.66;2987.57;en>>
We did not encourage, promote, or organize acts of violence, such as the use of weapons, incinerations, looting.

<<2987.57;2995.01;en>>
Yet, we made a call to transform the people's anger into street protest by all means possible.

<<2995.01;2997.82;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<2997.82;3008.26;en>>
the applicant's euphemism, all means possible, resulted in 45 people's death and 769 injured.

<<3008.26;3011.38;en>>
Mr. President, let me briefly address the question

<<3011.38;3019.78;en>>
why the applicant was kept in detention for two years and 10 months before his spirit trial detention was lifted on 2nd September.

<<3019.78;3027.49;en>>
During this period, 23 hearings were held in the criminal trial.

<<3027.49;3032.62;en>>
From the outset, the applicant tried to obstruct and delay the proceedings.

<<3032.62;3037.78;en>>
In particular, he refused to attend two hearings.

<<3037.78;3043.78;en>>
At six hearings, the applicant refused to make his defense submissions.

<<3043.78;3051.38;en>>
Then, at the hearing on 2nd September, none of the applicant's lawyers, more than 100, attended the hearing.

<<3051.38;3055.18;en>>
The court presumed that his defense has been completed.

<<3055.18;3063.53;en>>
Upon completion of his defense, the court no longer saw any reason for the applicant's spirit trial detention and ordered his release.

<<3063.53;3072.78;en>>
Accordingly, there is no need for the court to order the release of applicants from spirit trial detention under Article 46 of the Convention.

<<3072.78;3075.53;en>>
Mr. President, this ends my presentation.

<<3075.53;3079.76;en>>
May I now invite you to give the floor to Professor Talman.

<<3079.76;3080.86;en>>
Thanks for your attention.

I'll see you next time.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<3083.21;3084.71;en>>
Thank you. I call Mr. Talmon.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<3092.55;3097.03;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<3097.03;3100.83;en>>
it is always a privilege and honor to appear before you.

<<3103.75;3107.43;en>>
Mr. President, the government submits

<<3107.43;3124.91;en>>
that five of the applicants' six complaints are inadmissible because they are currently investigated by the Human Rights Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union the IPU Human Rights Committee.

<<3127.31;3147.99;en>>
Article 35, paragraph 2B of the convention provides that the court shall not deal with an application that is substantially the same as a matter that has already been submitted to another procedure of international investigation or settlement.

<<3147.99;3155.71;en>>
The government submits that the IPU Human Rights Committee qualifies as such a procedure.

<<3158.23;3165.95;en>>
It provides for quasi-judicial proceedings similar to those set up by the convention.

<<3168.35;3189.19;en>>
The committee is an effective procedure, and according to the IPU Human Rights Committee, according to the IPU itself, I quote, has a solid track record of providing concrete help for those who suffer abuse.

<<3193.27;3206.03;en>>
The present application is substantially the same as the complaint submitted to the IPU Human Rights Committee.

<<3206.03;3221.35;en>>
Only the length of the proceedings before the constitutional court, the Article 5, paragraph 4 complaint, is not currently before the IPU Human Rights Committee.

<<3225.11;3228.19;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<3228.19;3238.99;en>>
the applicant objects to the status of the IPU Human Rights Committee as another procedure on six grounds.

<<3238.99;3243.43;en>>
I will deal with these one by one.

<<3243.43;3284.27;en>>
But before doing so, let me recall that in terms of the nature of the supervisory body, the procedure it follows, and the effect of its decisions, the committee has many similarities with the Working Group on Arbitrary Retention of the UN Human Rights Council and the Committee on Freedom of Association of the International Labor Organization, which the court has recognized as other procedures of international investigation.

<<3284.27;3288.81;en>>
Let me turn to the applicant's first objection.

<<3288.81;3294.53;en>>
The procedure must allegedly be based on an international treaty.

<<3297.65;3315.49;en>>
Neither the Working Group nor the Committee on Freedom of Association is based on a treaty, but has been established by a decision of the respective institutions.

<<3315.49;3323.77;en>>
It is membership of the institution rather than a treaty that is the basis of jurisdiction of these bodies.

<<3327.65;3337.91;en>>
Second, the applicant claims that the procedure must be directly accessible to the applicant.

<<3337.91;3344.17;en>>
Again, the two other bodies show that this is not the case.

<<3344.17;3363.63;en>>
The fact that individuals cannot be complainants before the Freedom of Association Committee did not prevent this court in POA and others versus United Kingdom from holding that the matter had been submitted to another procedure of international investigation.

<<3363.63;3376.61;en>>
Third, the applicant claims that the procedure must make a judicial determination of violation of rights.

<<3376.61;3387.73;en>>
However, the term another procedure refers to both judicial and quasi-judicial procedures.

<<3387.73;3394.17;en>>
None of the two other bodies make judicial determinations.

<<3394.17;3405.69;en>>
Fourth, the applicant maintains that there must be a final decision.

<<3405.69;3415.93;en>>
Again, the other two bodies do not issue decisions, but non-binding opinions or conclusions.

<<3415.93;3424.73;en>>
It is also not necessary that the other procedure has been concluded.

<<3424.73;3447.89;en>>
As the court held in Karisiotis versus Portugal, it cannot deal with any application which has already been investigated or, I emphasize, is being investigated by an international body.

<<3447.89;3458.69;en>>
Fifth, the applicant argues that the procedure must offer effective remedies that remove the violation in question.

<<3459.41;3488.13;en>>
In the past, the IPU Human Rights Committee has determined that there were violations of human rights and has issued calls for release from detention and the payment of compensation, measures which could effectively remedy the alleged violations in the present case.

<<3488.13;3499.57;en>>
Finally, the applicant asserts that the procedure must provide a mechanism monitoring the implementation of the remedies proposed.

<<3502.05;3513.73;en>>
It is submitted that such a mechanism may be found in Rule 13, paragraph 2 of the IPU Committee's Rules and Decisions.

<<3513.73;3525.17;en>>
In addition, the committee follows up each case until a satisfactory settlement is reached and the case is closed.

<<3528.17;3531.69;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<3531.69;3540.25;en>>
as the applicant's case is currently under investigation, I would like to ask you to consider the following questions.

<<3540.25;3555.77;en>>
As the applicant's case is currently under investigation by the IPU Human Rights Committee, the application, with the sole exception of Article 5, paragraph 4, must be rejected.

<<3565.33;3568.11;en>>
Mr. President, let me now turn to the government's

<<3568.11;3576.85;en>>
second objection to the admissibility of the application, the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.

<<3579.51;3596.05;en>>
The applicant has neither exhausted the remedy of individual application to the constitutional court, nor has he exhausted the compensation remedy under the Code of Criminal Procedure.

<<3596.05;3600.81;en>>
I will deal with these two remedies in turn.

<<3600.81;3606.21;en>>
But before doing so, let me raise a question of general principle.

<<3609.57;3624.41;en>>
As a consequence of the subsidiarity principle, the applicant must exhaust domestic remedies before lodging an application with the court.

<<3624.41;3632.25;en>>
The relevant date is the date of filing of the application.

<<3632.25;3639.01;en>>
Only in special circumstances, a departure from that rule may be justified.

<<3643.33;3664.45;en>>
The applicant argues that, I quote, if the court started to examine an application made under Article 5, paragraph 1c, only after a final decision, this would render the right to individual petition before this court ineffective.

<<3668.57;3671.37;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<3671.37;3675.29;en>>
the applicant's argument is flawed for two reasons.

<<3675.29;3683.25;en>>
First, the applicant does not have to wait for a final decision in the criminal case.

<<3683.25;3688.53;en>>
He can always challenge the decisions on pretrial detention separately.

<<3691.13;3699.73;en>>
Second, the argument shows a basic misunderstanding of the domestic remedy requirement.

<<3699.73;3711.01;en>>
This court is not to act as a domestic court reviewing decisions on pretrial detention.

<<3711.01;3718.33;en>>
But it is to supervise the implementation of the convention by contracting states and their courts.

<<3721.93;3731.81;en>>
The present application was submitted to the court on the 20th of February, 2017.

<<3731.81;3741.17;en>>
At that time, the remedies before the constitutional court had not been exhausted.

<<3741.17;3752.81;en>>
In fact, the first of three individual applications with regard to pretrial detention had only just be filed.

<<3752.81;3765.65;en>>
The other two applications were filed with the constitutional court only after the present case was instituted, and both applications are still pending.

<<3768.97;3787.89;en>>
The applicant has used the present application as an alternative remedy rather than as a substitution as an alternative remedy rather than as a subsidiary one in order to put pressure on the domestic courts.

<<3791.65;3794.13;en>>
Mr. President, the applicant has not

<<3794.13;3811.17;en>>
identified any special circumstances justifying a departure from the rule that the domestic remedies had to be exhausted on the 20th of February, 2017.

<<3811.17;3818.25;en>>
For that reason alone, the application must be considered premature and must be rejected.

<<3827.61;3829.97;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<3829.97;3836.33;en>>
let me now take a closer look at the domestic remedies available to the applicant.

<<3836.33;3844.53;en>>
First, there is a right to bring individual applications to the constitutional court.

<<3844.53;3852.81;en>>
The parties are in agreement that the present application concerns six separate complaints.

<<3852.81;3869.69;en>>
The applicant has alleged a violation of Articles 5, Paragraph 1C, 3, and 4, Articles 10 and 18, and Article 3 of Protocol Number 1 of the Convention.

<<3874.35;3889.73;en>>
Domestic remedies must be exhausted with regard to each individual claim and in compliance with the formal requirements and time limits laid down in domestic law.

<<3889.73;3905.81;en>>
The applicant did not validly raise the complaints with regard to Articles 5, Paragraph 3, and 18 of the Convention in his first individual application to the constitutional court.

<<3905.81;3929.85;en>>
Contrary to the applicant's assertion, the complaints concerning Article 5, Paragraph 3, and 18, as well as Article 3 of Protocol 1, were validly raised only in November 2017 and May 2018, respectively.

<<3933.37;3942.83;en>>
The second and third application are still pending before the constitutional court.

<<3942.83;3956.25;en>>
The complaints under Article 5, Paragraph 3, and 18, as well as Article 3 of Protocol 1, must therefore be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies.

<<3961.81;3964.53;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<3964.53;3970.39;en>>
let me now turn to the second remedy which has not been exhausted.

<<3970.39;3997.93;en>>
The claim for compensation under Article 141, Paragraphs 1A and D of the CCP, the Code of Criminal Procedure, which allows anyone who was illegally detained or who was not tried within a reasonable time to claim pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages.

<<4000.81;4017.33;en>>
This court has held in AS versus Turkey that in case of the deprivation of liberty, the receipt of compensation is an adequate remedy once pretrial detention has ended.

<<4020.33;4034.65;en>>
The applicant's pretrial detention ended at the latest on 2nd September 2019 when the domestic court ordered his release from pretrial detention.

<<4038.25;4063.49;en>>
Considering its subsidiary role, the court has held, for example, in the cases of AS, Yildiz, Demir, and Yalcin, all against Turkey, that the compensation remedy must be exhausted even if it becomes available after the application was made to the court.

<<4067.09;4086.93;en>>
There is ample authority that a compensation claim under Article 141, Paragraph 1D, is an effective remedy in respect of claims concerning the unreasableness of the duration of pretrial detention.

<<4086.93;4091.45;en>>
The applicant does not call this into question.

<<4091.45;4124.29;en>>
The applicant, however, claims, and I quote, that Article 141 is not an effective remedy concerning the legality of arrest and asserts that Article 141 of the CCP has never been accepted as an effective remedy for complaints about the legality of arrest under the case law of this court.

<<4124.29;4130.85;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court, this is not correct.

<<4130.85;4138.17;en>>
The applicant relies on the case of Lutfi Zengin and others versus Turkey.

<<4138.17;4146.37;en>>
But this case was concerned with the compensation claim under Article 141, Paragraph 1D.

<<4149.37;4191.89;en>>
Claims for unlawful deprivation of liberty, including the question of whether there are sufficient reasons to justify detention, can be brought under Article 141, Paragraph 1A, which provides, and I quote, compensation for damage may be claimed from the state by anyone who has been arrested or taken or kept in detention under conditions or in circumstances not complying with the law.

<<4191.89;4210.69;en>>
The law provides in Article 100, Paragraph 1 of the CCP that any detention requires that there exists a strong suspicion of a crime and a ground for detention.

<<4210.69;4216.11;en>>
In addition, the detention must be proportionate.

<<4216.11;4221.09;en>>
The same is true for any continuation of detention.

<<4221.09;4232.57;en>>
If any of these conditions is not fulfilled, a claim for compensation may be brought under Article 141, Paragraph 1A.

<<4236.01;4267.43;en>>
This was confirmed by the Constitutional Court, which stated in Paragraphs 99 and 100 of its decision of the 21st of December, 2017, and I quote, the first paragraph of Article 141 envisages that those who were unlawfully arrested or placed in pretrial detention may file an action for compensation.

<<4267.43;4277.71;en>>
The remedy of claim for compensation envisaged in Article 141 is an effective remedy that must be exhausted.

<<4280.51;4288.51;en>>
The compensation remedy is thus not limited to claims concerning the duration of detention.

<<4288.51;4302.19;en>>
But in Article 141, Paragraph 1A, also covers claims concerning a lack of reasonable suspicion or the absence of a ground for detention.

<<4304.75;4308.59;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<4308.59;4332.15;en>>
the court itself has accepted in Mustafa Avci versus Turkey and in Yalcin versus Turkey that a compensation claim under Article 141, Paragraph 1A, is an effective remedy with regard to the legality of arrest and detention.

<<4332.15;4347.51;en>>
The 12th Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation, for example, in its decision of 22nd June, 2016, awarded compensation because the deprivation of liberty was found to be grave.

<<4347.51;4353.19;en>>
And the deprivation of liberty was found to be contrary to the law.

<<4356.23;4377.87;en>>
In the case of Pasha by Raqqa and Aydin Kaya versus Turkey, the court held that it was apparent from the decisions of the 12th Criminal Division that some of the complainants had obtained compensation which they said was contrary to the law.

<<4387.03;4391.03;en>>
Mr. President, is this correct that the government cannot

<<4391.03;4404.55;en>>
produce any example where Article 141, Paragraph 1A, has successfully been invoked in a case identical to that of the applicant?

<<4404.55;4439.63;en>>
But as the court has held in other cases concerning Article 141, for example, in Demir, Mustafa Avci, Guccez, and Balca, there is no indication that the review that will be exercised by the domestic courts on this occasion will be limited in any way so as to be able to doubt from the outset the effectiveness of such an appeal and affirm that such a remedy would be obviously doomed to failure.

<<4443.07;4448.35;en>>
There is no ground to depart from this line of reasoning in the present case.

<<4448.35;4457.07;en>>
The question is not whether there is a precedent, but whether an action for compensation can be brought under the law.

<<4457.07;4462.07;en>>
Mr. President, let me finally address the applicant's

<<4462.07;4480.15;en>>
argument that his detention has been reviewed 61 times by the criminal courts, and that, I quote, an Article 141 case, which is a civil case, cannot overrule these consistent criminal court findings.

<<4480.15;4492.15;en>>
If that were correct, there could never be a successful compensation claim under Article 141, paragraph 1.

<<4492.15;4502.99;en>>
A successful compensation claim is by definition based on the finding that the criminal courts got it wrong.

<<4502.99;4513.23;en>>
The applicant's argument is also based on the fact the applicant's argument is also not in line with the law.

<<4513.23;4538.27;en>>
Both Article 142, paragraph 6 of the CCP, and Article 74 of the Code of Obligations show that in compensation proceedings, judges are not bound by the criminal court findings.

<<4538.27;4541.67;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<4541.67;4560.67;en>>
the applicant has a remedy by which he can obtain compensation in respect of his complaints under Article 5, paragraph 1 and 3 of the Convention with regard to both the legality and the duration of his pretrial detention.

<<4560.67;4567.19;en>>
It follows that these complaints are inadmissible and must be rejected.

<<4577.91;4582.51;en>>
Mr. President, let me now turn briefly

<<4582.51;4586.11;en>>
to the merits of the application.

<<4586.11;4600.71;en>>
As I've just demonstrated, the only admissible complaint in the present case concerns the alleged violation of Article 5, paragraph 4.

<<4600.71;4629.95;en>>
The government has shown in its observations that in light of the constitutional court's exceptional caseload and the complexity of the application, a period of 13 months and four days cannot be considered a violation of Article 5, paragraph 4, especially if that period concerns proceedings before a constitutional court.

<<4629.95;4632.63;en>>
As Dr. Archigl has shown,

<<4632.63;4639.51;en>>
the case numbers presented by the applicant have no bearing on reality.

<<4639.51;4655.79;en>>
The same is true for the assertions that the applicant's case was not a complex one and that the detention of a member of parliament was not a new issue for the constitutional court.

<<4655.79;4657.95;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<4657.95;4679.71;en>>
the constitutional court, in its decision of the 21st of December 2017, saw this differently, as can be seen in paragraphs 166 to 169 of its judgment.

<<4679.71;4683.75;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<4683.75;4697.75;en>>
for the government's position on the merits of the other inadmissible complaints, I would respectfully direct you to the written observations.

<<4697.75;4712.27;en>>
Let me just use this opportunity to address two of the applicant's arguments with regard to Articles 5, paragraph 1, and 10 of the Convention.

<<4712.27;4731.87;en>>
The applicant asserts that his detention and criminal prosecution were not prescribed by law because they allegedly were not foreseeable because of his immunity as a member of parliament.

<<4731.87;4736.39;en>>
Mr. President, it suffices to point out

<<4736.39;4745.27;en>>
that the offenses the applicant has been prosecuted for could always be found in the criminal code.

<<4745.27;4765.27;en>>
His arrest and detention were always governed by the CCP, and the possibility for lifting of his immunity was always present in Article 83, paragraph 2 of the Turkish Constitution.

<<4765.27;4771.59;en>>
Immunity does not preclude detention and prosecution.

<<4771.59;4779.03;en>>
It is only a temporary bar which may be lifted at any time.

<<4779.03;4804.23;en>>
With regard to the question of foreseeability and the lawfulness of detention and prosecution, it does not make any difference whether immunity is lifted at any one time by an individual or general decision or by a constitutional amendment adopted by parliament.

<<4804.23;4813.39;en>>
The applicant's other argument with regard to Article 5, paragraph 1C, is also unconvincing.

<<4813.39;4839.43;en>>
The applicant asserts that the detention decision did not establish any reasonable suspicion of the applicant having committed a crime, and that the constitutional court, at its own initiative, had put forward new reasons as grounds for reasonable suspicion.

<<4839.43;4846.91;en>>
This argument is based on a misreading of the detention decision.

<<4846.91;4869.63;en>>
The applicant identifies, I quote, the number of prosecutorial files prepared with respect to the applicant as one of the reasons allegedly put forward by the magistrate's court to establish reasonable suspicion of a crime.

<<4869.63;4874.23;en>>
Mr. President, it is not the number of these files,

<<4874.23;4879.59;en>>
but their content which the magistrate's court was referring to.

<<4879.59;4907.83;en>>
The decision shows that the magistrate's court based its decision on the applicant's acts and statements expressly set out in the decision, and in addition, on the content of 18 individual prosecutorial files which were identified in the decision by file number and content.

<<4907.83;4917.79;en>>
The constitutional court, like the magistrate's court, relied on the content of these files when reviewing the latter's decision.

<<4917.79;4926.71;en>>
There is thus no question of the constitutional court putting forward new reasons for reasonable suspicion.

<<4926.71;4935.99;en>>
All these reasons can be found in the 18 identified prosecutorial files.

<<4935.99;4948.63;en>>
The government would respectfully invite the court to examine the decision of the magistrate's court for itself.

<<4948.63;4967.47;en>>
In conclusion, the government respectfully requests the court to declare the complaints, with the exception of Article 5, Paragraph 4 of the Convention, inadmissible, and the latter claim to be unfounded.

<<4967.47;4977.23;en>>
Alternatively, the government requests the court to reject the complaints on the merits.

<<4977.23;4980.43;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<4980.43;4983.43;en>>
on behalf of the delegation of Turkey, I thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<4987.91;4988.47;en>>
Thank you.

<<4988.47;4990.31;en>>
I call Mrs. Mijatović.

[[ThirdParty;TP1]]

<<4999.14;5003.22;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<5003.22;5020.66;en>>
I have decided to take part in this hearing because of the importance of this case for a number of human rights issues my office has been following very closely in Turkey, in particular the use of pretrial detention in the Turkish justice system.

<<5020.66;5032.4;en>>
At the outset, let me stress that I fully subscribe to the original written submission that my predecessor, Nils Muzniacs, made in the present case in November 2017.

<<5032.4;5038.9;en>>
But I would like to take this occasion to complement that submission based on my recent work.

<<5038.9;5046.42;en>>
I hope that this will help to put in context numerous cases pending before this court, including this one.

<<5046.42;5055.26;en>>
Since the beginning of my mandate in April 2018, questions relevant to this case have featured prominently on my agenda.

<<5055.26;5068.98;en>>
In January this year, I made a written submission in the case of Kavala versus Turkey and shared with this court my concerns about the use of pretrial detention in Turkey and criminal proceedings in general.

<<5068.98;5083.98;en>>
More recently, at the beginning of July, I conducted a country visit to Turkey, focusing on the judiciary, among other issues, paying particular attention to the functioning of the criminal justice system and the independence of the judiciary.

<<5083.98;5092.1;en>>
The present case, which concerns allegedly unlawful arrest and detention, it is far from being isolated.

<<5092.1;5104.02;en>>
My office also intervened as a third party before this court concerning the detention of many other members of parliament, journalists, and, as just mentioned, a human rights defender.

<<5104.02;5112.74;en>>
These cases are representative of a widespread pattern raising fundamental human rights concern.

<<5112.74;5126.06;en>>
Among my main concerns regarding these cases is the systematic failure by Turkish courts to meet the requirements of Article 5 for arrest, initial, and continued detention.

<<5126.06;5141.74;en>>
Decisions ordering initial detention and its continuation, and in particular, the decisions of magistrates, also known as criminal judgeships of the peace, continue to be stereotypical and abstract in nature.

<<5141.74;5154.5;en>>
They often fail to reference credible evidence to establish a reasonable suspicion and to address the factual grounds of the case and the individual circumstances of the suspect.

<<5154.5;5164.66;en>>
Likewise, courts often fail to demonstrate other grounds to justify deprivation of liberty, such as necessity and proportionality.

<<5164.66;5179.74;en>>
It is also increasingly common that the evidence used to justify detention is exclusively limited to statements and acts which are clearly nonviolent and should a priori be protected under the convention, in particular, under Article 10.

<<5179.74;5205.9;en>>
Turkish prosecutors and courts systematically are subject to a large body of case law finding violations of the right to freedom of expression in Turkey spanning for more than two decades.

<<5205.9;5212.42;en>>
Furthermore, the suspect's ability to challenge their detention is limited.

<<5212.42;5218.42;en>>
A significant problem is the closed circuit system in which magistrates operate.

<<5218.42;5225.54;en>>
Another one is the denial of access to the investigation file without proper justification.

<<5225.54;5231.98;en>>
Now, such access restrictions has become almost automatic in the Turkish legal system.

<<5231.98;5241.9;en>>
I think that in such case, it should be up to the authorities to prove why such a restriction was absolutely necessary in the circumstances.

<<5241.9;5262.94;en>>
Now, as regard the questions of a speedy judicial review, I already argued before this court that systematic delays affecting the review of detention cases by the Turkish Constitutional Court caused serious doubts on the effectiveness of the individual application procedure.

<<5262.94;5281.76;en>>
I consider that a constitutional court has neither the capacity nor should it have the role to act as an appeal court for all detention cases, while lower courts continue to ignore the principles contained in the constitutional court's case law.

<<5281.76;5291.72;en>>
The combination of these and other factors results in a situation where detention on remand become de facto, an instrument of punishment.

<<5291.72;5307.02;en>>
In the case of members of parliament, including the applicant, lengthy detention also had the obvious result of depriving a significant portion of the Turkish population from democratic representation.

<<5307.02;5323.28;en>>
Regarding the issue whether detention is being used for purposes other than those prescribed by convention, my predecessor put to this court that laws and criminal proceedings in Turkey were being used to silent dissenting voices.

<<5323.28;5330.84;en>>
The chamber gave significant weight to these observations in its judgments finding a violation of Article 18.

<<5330.84;5345.96;en>>
This problem is still ongoing in Turkey, affecting not only opposition parliamentarians, but also human rights defenders, journalists, academics, and other critical voices in the society.

<<5345.96;5357.14;en>>
They are regularly subjected to the judicial actions based on their supposed intentions, often with no proof of criminal activity other than nonviolent statements.

<<5357.14;5364.56;en>>
To be clear, the problem goes far beyond detention and affects criminal proceedings as a whole.

<<5364.56;5373.68;en>>
Indeed, many people were convicted in this manner for very serious offenses in recent years, including life sentences.

<<5373.68;5394.34;en>>
This led me to state after my recent visit to Turkey that this longstanding problem, which results from an overbroad definition of terrorism in statutes and the judiciary's tendency to stretch it even further, has now reached unprecedented levels.

<<5394.34;5408.1;en>>
During this visit, I also observed that what is used as evidence is sometimes so inconsistent that it has become virtually impossible to foresee in good faith the legal consequences of actions.

<<5408.1;5418.22;en>>
The crucial problem in this connection is the fact that whether an investigation is initiated or not appears to be heavily determined by prevailing political circumstances.

<<5418.22;5423.98;en>>
This uncertainty discourages legitimate dissent and criticism.

<<5423.98;5444.94;en>>
I would also like to add that since my predecessor's written submission in this case, the independence and impartiality of the Turkish judiciary continued to deteriorate as a direct result of certain measures taken during the two-year state of emergency following the attempted coup in Turkey in July 2016.

<<5444.94;5465.48;en>>
These measures included changes to the Turkish Council of Judges and Prosecutors in clear contradiction with the Council of Europe standards and a suspension of ordinary safeguards and procedures for the dismissal, recruitment, and appointment of judges and prosecutors.

<<5465.48;5473.28;en>>
Around 3,900 judges and prosecutors were thus dismissed and 10,000 appointed.

<<5473.28;5485.98;en>>
This may explain why the Turkish judiciary appears today less able and willing than before to uphold the rights set out in the convention when confronted with sensitive cases.

<<5485.98;5502.5;en>>
In the specific case of the parliamentarians, my predecessors put to this court that the detention of HDP MPs formed part of a more general pattern of repression against different groups in Turkey who are critical of official policy.

<<5502.5;5512.42;en>>
He gave the example of the removal of mayors from office and their replacement by non-elected officials using criminal investigations against them as a pretext.

<<5512.42;5528.14;en>>
This practice is still ongoing, despite criticism from many bodies of the Council of Europe, Venice Commission, Parliamentary Assembly, Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, and my own office.

<<5528.14;5537.9;en>>
Such measures are symptomatic of the continuing repressive climate affecting the democratic opposition in Turkey, especially the applicants' party.

<<5537.9;5549.68;en>>
It is against this background that I see the interplay between judicial, political, and legislative processes that led to the eventual detention of the applicant and other MPs.

<<5549.68;5562.18;en>>
Crucially, this included the lifting of their parliamentary immunity in what was considered a misuse of the constitutional amendment procedure by the Venice Commission and by the Parliamentary Assembly.

<<5562.18;5586.42;en>>
The resulting criminal proceedings affected almost all MPs of HDP and some MPs of CHP, since the prosecutors has been disproportionately active in initiating investigation against them, mainly targeting their statements for supposed terrorist propaganda, incitement to hatred, or insulting the president.

<<5586.42;5603.24;en>>
The preamble of the constitutional amendment itself stated that its purpose was to address public indignation about the, I quote, statements of certain deputies constituting emotional and moral support to terrorism, end of quote.

<<5603.24;5618.1;en>>
For an objective observer, this situation would create a strong impression that these criminal proceedings were seriously flawed from the very outset and sought to silence them as parliamentarians.

<<5618.1;5632.22;en>>
It bears repeating that these proceedings also systematically disregarded Turkey's obligation under Article 10 of the Convention, as articulated by this court in numerous judgments, many of which against Turkey.

<<5632.22;5655.98;en>>
In these circumstances, it is difficult to discredit the argument that criminal proceedings have been and are being used selectively and ab initio, starting with criminal investigations, arrests, and initial detention decisions with the express purpose to silence dissenting voices and to discourage criticism in the society.

<<5655.98;5664.58;en>>
The chilling effect caused by this state of affairs is very palpable in all segments of Turkish society today.

<<5664.58;5675.46;en>>
And I think that Turkey and Turkish courts at all levels need the guidance of this court more than ever to change this course.

<<5675.46;5678.6;en>>
I hope my comments will be helpful to the court.

<<5678.6;5680.5;en>>
And I thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<5684.53;5687.73;en>>
Thank you for your submissions.

<<5687.73;5694.45;en>>
I now invite the judges of the Grand Chamber wishing to do so to put their questions to the partners, Judge Felici.

[[Judge;Gilberto Felici]]

<<5698.64;5701.76;en>>
Thank you so much, Mr. President.

<<5701.76;5704.32;en>>
I have just three questions.

<<5704.32;5711.8;en>>
First of all, I'm coming back on a subject touched in the hearing, just to resume definitively.

<<5711.8;5717.7;en>>
It appears from the party's submission that they disagree on a factual aspect of the case.

<<5717.7;5742.68;en>>
According to the applicant in paragraph 144 of its observation, following and after the lifting of the parliamentary immunities, no criminal investigation was initiated against the deputy belonging to the AKP or to the MHP, although the parliamentary immunities were also listed.

<<5742.68;5761.16;en>>
The government submit in paragraph 90 of its observation that five AKP deputies and one MHP deputy were also convicted or sentenced after the lifting of their parliamentary immunity.

<<5761.16;5767.32;en>>
I will invite the government to clarify the court on this matter.

<<5767.32;5777.76;en>>
In particular, are there any AKP and or MHP deputies who have been sentenced after the lifting of their parliamentary immunity?

<<5777.76;5783.32;en>>
Where appropriate, the applicant may also answer this question.

<<5783.32;5805.6;en>>
Second, the judgment issued by the chamber exactly at paragraph 275 has established that due to the conclusion already reached, it is not necessary to pronounce specifically on the alleged violation of Article 10, either from the point of view of admissibility or from that of the ground.

<<5805.6;5814.78;en>>
I would like to know from both parties what their opinion is in this respect, having regard to the court's jurisprudence on this subject.

<<5814.78;5825.28;en>>
Third, in the Turkish legal system, is it possible for a deputy placed in pretrial detention to propose drafting law?

<<5825.28;5830.68;en>>
Where appropriate, the parties are invited to produce relevant legislation in this area.

<<5830.68;5830.68;en>>
Thank you so much.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<5833.66;5835.38;en>>
Thank you. Judge Yüksel, please.

[[Judge;Saadet Yüksel]]

<<5837.15;5838.19;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<5838.19;5842.91;en>>
I have two questions, and the first is directed to both parties.

<<5842.91;5846.19;en>>
The second is directed to the applicant.

<<5846.19;5862.43;en>>
So, the applicant's lawyers have submitted to the court a document issued on 11th of December, 2018, according to which the applicant started to serve his sentence of four years and eight months as of 7th of September, 2018.

<<5862.43;5879.87;en>>
So, in light of this evidence, as of this date, can the applicant still be considered in pretrial detention or in detention because of his conviction and be deprived of his liberty for the purposes of Article 5.1A of the Convention?

<<5879.87;5883.19;en>>
And my second question is directed to the applicant.

<<5883.19;5896.11;en>>
In your observations, you pointed out in particular that Turkish law did not allow detained members of Parliament to vote by proxy, since they are required to be physically present in order to vote.

<<5896.11;5904.83;en>>
So, in this respect, I wonder if you are aware of any European state that allows a detained member of Parliament to vote by proxy.

<<5904.83;5911.63;en>>
I ask, as it may be relevant if the court were to determine the existence of a European consensus on this issue.

<<5911.63;5911.63;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<5913.55;5915.19;en>>
Thank you, Judge Nußberger.

[[Judge;Angelika Nußberger]]

<<5917.36;5918.96;en>>
Thank you, President.

<<5918.96;5923.64;en>>
I'm interested in the status of parliamentarians in Turkey.

<<5923.64;5929.76;en>>
And so let me just quote Article 83, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution.

<<5929.76;5953.68;en>>
Members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly shall not be liable for their votes and statements in the course of the Assembly's work, for the views they express before the Assembly, or unless the Assembly decides otherwise on the proposal of the Bureau for a particular sitting, for repeating or disseminating such views outside the Assembly.

<<5953.68;5960.28;en>>
So this is a clear rule on parliamentary non-liability.

<<5960.28;5981.2;en>>
The intention is, as stated in the judgment of the Turkish Constitutional Court of 21st March 1994, I quote, to allow those responsible for legislative duties to carry them out in the knowledge that they were safely sheltered, and rightly so, from all worry and pressure.

<<5981.2;5983.2;en>>
So this was not changed.

<<5983.2;5989.96;en>>
It was Article 83, Paragraph 2 that was changed, not this rule on non-liability.

<<5989.96;5995.92;en>>
So my question is now how to interpret or how this rule is interpreted in Turkey.

<<5995.92;6002.36;en>>
First, is there a specific procedure if statements are made outside Parliament?

<<6002.36;6008.46;en>>
It's written that on the proposal of the Bureau, a decision of the Assembly for a particular sitting.

<<6008.46;6017.44;en>>
So is there always a specific decision if speeches outside Parliament are not under this protection?

<<6017.44;6022.88;en>>
And were there such decisions taken in the case of the applicant?

<<6022.88;6030.56;en>>
And how is it interpreted to say for repeating and disseminating views outside?

<<6030.56;6034.84;en>>
Must it be a literal repetition, or can it be general?

<<6034.84;6036.56;en>>
How is that interpreted?

<<6036.56;6047.48;en>>
And if the article talks about speeches, does it also apply to tweets or other forums in the social media?

<<6047.48;6050.4;en>>
This is my first question.

<<6050.4;6064.36;en>>
And my second question, I have closely followed what the government's representative said about foreseeability under Article 83.2

<<6064.36;6066.24;en>>
and the change in the Constitution.

<<6066.24;6076.68;en>>
And I just want to ask, if I understand you correctly, that you don't include the aspect of procedural guarantees in foreseeability.

<<6076.68;6083.48;en>>
And the last question concerns evidence.

<<6083.48;6095.32;en>>
I understand that there were two criminal different crimes, membership of a terrorist organization and incitement to hatred.

<<6095.32;6106.86;en>>
And on the second crime, membership of a terrorist organization, I wonder what were the concrete elements on which this suspicion was based on.

<<6106.86;6124.8;en>>
The applicant argues in observations paragraph 32 that this was based only, I quote now the applicant, on the similarity of a tweet by the HDP party and a tweet by Murat Karayilan of the PKK.

<<6124.8;6127.96;en>>
But this was proved to be a fake account.

<<6127.96;6129.4;en>>
So I wonder, is that true?

<<6129.4;6131.68;en>>
Was it really a fake account?

<<6131.68;6134.96;en>>
And what were the elements the suspicion was based on?

<<6134.96;6134.96;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<6137.72;6140.32;en>>
Judge Eicke.

[[Judge;Tim Eicke]]

<<6142.53;6144.03;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<6144.03;6153.31;en>>
Just one quick follow-up question, in a sense, to the questions asked by my colleague, Judge Nußberger.

<<6153.31;6167.07;en>>
She's asked a question about the relevance of the procedural guarantees before the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in relation to individual cases of the seeking and lifting of the immunity.

<<6167.07;6169.75;en>>
And I would equally be interested in that.

<<6169.75;6177.55;en>>
The second question for me comes from her last question about evidence in relation to membership of a terrorist organization.

<<6177.55;6181.31;en>>
I'm not so much concerned about that.

<<6181.31;6182.47;en>>
She's asked that question.

<<6182.47;6188.07;en>>
My concern is more in terms of foreseeability.

<<6188.07;6198.97;en>>
On what basis can it be said, or is it said, that the definition applied by the Turkish courts of what is a terrorist organization was, in fact, foreseeable?

<<6198.97;6202.23;en>>
And what is that definition based on?

<<6202.23;6218.69;en>>
And if it is based solely on national law, in how far is this court, or should this court, have regard to wider European or worldwide acceptance of that definition as a terrorist organization outside Turkey?

<<6218.69;6218.95;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<6220.84;6222.56;en>>
Thank you, Judge Harutyunyan.

[[Judge;Armen Harutyunyan]]

<<6225.59;6227.93;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<6227.93;6233.81;en>>
I have two questions, one for applicants and one for government.

<<6233.81;6245.35;en>>
The first question for applicants, the government claims that your client refused to appear before the trial court, which ordered his continued detention.

<<6245.35;6253.43;en>>
If so, did the applicant's refusal contribute to the overall length of the trial detention?

<<6253.43;6264.21;en>>
And my second question for government, that shortly after the declaration of the Dolmabahçe consensus, the president of Turkey, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,

<<6264.21;6271.47;en>>
said that it was out of the question that the government would reach an agreement with a terrorist organization.

<<6271.47;6279.65;en>>
And several weeks before the parliamentary elections of 7 June 2015, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Erdoğan],

<<6279.65;6283.03;en>>
made the following statement to the press.

<<6283.03;6295.01;en>>
If the HDB exceeds the threshold, meaning the representation in parliament, and the AKP government loses power, there will be no solution process.

<<6295.01;6304.91;en>>
Does it mean that the solution process with the political opposition party was conditioned by not exceeding the threshold of representativeness?

<<6304.91;6310.31;en>>
And how such statements can be interpreted within the context of free elections?

<<6310.31;6310.31;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<6312.02;6314.02;fr>>
Thank you, le juge Potocki.

[[Judge;André Potocki]]

<<6317.58;6318.58;fr>>
Merci, M. le Président.

<<6318.78;6326.58;fr>>
Je voudrais revenir un instant sur les questions qui ont été posées par Mme la juge Nußberger et par M. le juge Eicke.

<<6329.5;6340.9;fr>>
L'immunité parlementaire a notamment pour but de protéger la liberté d'expression renforcée dont doivent bénéficier les parlementaires.

<<6340.9;6349.54;fr>>
A ce titre-là, il bénéficie d'une non-responsabilité pour les discours qu'il prononce.

<<6349.74;6375.34;fr>>
Lorsque néanmoins une demande de levée d'immunité parlementaire est présentée, il appartient à l'Assemblée, dont le parlementaire est membre, de vérifier avec beaucoup d'attention qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une façon détournée ou directe de porter atteinte à cette liberté d'expression que protège l'immunité.

<<6377.26;6395.66;fr>>
Cet examen auquel doit procéder l'Assemblée à qui une demande de levée d'immunité est présentée doit être d'autant plus attentif, me semble-t-il, lorsque cette demande d'immunité se rattache à des discours prononcés par un parlementaire.

<<6395.86;6407.26;fr>>
C'est bien le cas dans notre affaire où le requérant a fait l'objet d'une levée de son immunité parlementaire, principalement au titre des discours qu'il a prononcés.

<<6407.46;6452.26;fr>>
Ce qui est difficile pour moi à comprendre, et les explications données par les partis me seront précieuses, c'est comment cet examen vigilant, destiné à prononcer la nécessaire liberté d'expression d'un parlementaire, comment cet examen vigilant peut-il être mené lorsqu'il se traduit par une décision qui prend la forme d'un article général ajouté à la Constitution et qui s'applique sans précision aucune des cas individuels à l'ensemble des députés pour lesquels une demande de levée d'immunité était présentée auparavant par le gouvernement.

<<6462.56;6476.58;en>>
I just would like to follow up to the question of Judge Eicke, who asked to explain how the terrorist organization is understood, and this is actually a follow-up to what we have heard by the Commissioner.

<<6476.58;6493.24;en>>
In terms of over-broadness and how in Turkish society and Turkish judiciary this is approached nowadays, I would just like to broaden that a little bit, and if you can also address the issue of terrorist propaganda.

<<6493.24;6498.64;en>>
So not only terrorist organization, but terrorist propaganda and how is that understood.

<<6498.64;6498.64;en>>

<<6660.89;6661.89;en>>
I call Mrs. Çalı.

[[Applicant;AP4]]

<<6669.1;6671.38;en>>
If I may take the floor.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<6671.38;6675.88;en>>
Yes. Mr. Altıparmak, yes please.

[[Applicant;AP4]]

<<6676.88;6685.4;en>>
I'll try to answer questions about immunity and terrorism charges in Turkey.

<<6685.4;6696.98;en>>
The government claims that the constitutional amendment was foreseeable from both substantive and procedural perspectives.

<<6696.98;6707.55;en>>
In Turkish constitution, there are two types of immunity, non-liability and inviolability.

<<6707.55;6722.42;en>>
The first paragraph of Article 83 is related to legislative non-liability of MPs and implies that MPs shall not be punished for the expressions they use in parliament and repeat outside.

<<6722.42;6737.62;en>>
What we argue is this cannot be understood literally because a leader of a political party obviously will have to speak about different issues in the parliament as well as outside.

<<6737.62;6746.36;en>>
So in most cases, what he says in the parliament will be repeated but not in the same words outside the parliament.

<<6746.36;6762.74;en>>
It will be completely meaningless if we ask the applicant to memorize everything he said in the parliament and to repeat all of them outside the parliament.

<<6762.74;6777.42;en>>
When it comes to procedural foreseeability, normally when an immunity of an MP is lifted at the parliament, there is a procedure.

<<6777.42;6793.7;en>>
The parliament has the competence to decide whether the speech falls under paragraph one of Article 83 or paragraph two of Article 83.

<<6793.7;6823.7;en>>
With the blanket and retroactive constitutional amendment to lift parliamentary immunities on May 2016, the government took this opportunity from the parliament so the parliament could not decide whether the speeches of the applicants before you fall within the protection of Article 83, paragraph one.

<<6823.7;6845.98;en>>
So he, before the prosecutors, before all legal institutions in Turkey put this forward and stated that my speeches fall within the protection of Article 83, paragraph one, which is about non-liability of MPs.

<<6845.98;6856.5;en>>
But all his claims to this effect have been rejected or ignored by judicial authorities.

<<6856.5;6872.5;en>>
So for us, of course, his speeches outside the parliament, as long as it is related to the policy of the political party, are covered by paragraph one of Article 83.

<<6872.5;6887.3;en>>
And also, tweets and social media sharings of the applicants, because he shared not only his view, but the views of the HDP.

<<6887.3;6891.14;en>>
And I'm coming now to the question about terrorism charges.

<<6891.14;6894.7;en>>
This is quite a difficult question.

<<6894.7;6902.74;en>>
Our client is on trial now not for membership to terrorist organization.

<<6902.74;6908.24;en>>
Now he is accused of running a terrorist organization.

<<6908.24;6920.3;en>>
Not a single criminal file included in this case was about running a terrorist organization when they were submitted to the parliament.

<<6920.3;6932.66;en>>
But on January 2017, the prosecutor at the Erbaker indicted applicants for running a terrorist organization.

<<6932.66;6941.46;en>>
And we need to look at the decision of the Erbaker criminal peace judge on 4 November 2016.

<<6941.46;6954.9;en>>
You will see in that decision there is no evidence whatsoever about running a terrorist organization or being a member of a terrorist organization.

<<6954.9;6968.02;en>>
All of the evidence put forward by the prosecutor and relied on by the criminal peace judge were about his speeches made at different places.

<<6968.02;6979.86;en>>
This brings us to the question how terrorism, membership to terrorism, and terrorist propaganda are defined in Turkey.

<<6979.86;6995.9;en>>
In 2017, dear members of the court, only in one year, 136,000 people in Turkey were indicted for being a member of a terrorist organization.

<<6995.9;7004.42;en>>
At the very same year, 460,000 new investigations were initiated under that provision.

<<7004.42;7020.9;en>>
So the answer of the question is almost impossible to give, because every act of an opposition politician might be easily classified under this category.

<<7020.9;7023.82;en>>
And this is what happened in this court.

<<7023.82;7029.62;en>>
A lot of speeches of the applicants was brought under this definition.

<<7029.62;7035.18;en>>
And this is also true for the terrorist propaganda charges.

<<7035.18;7047.94;en>>
At the same year, 2017, there were new 24,000 indictments brought by prosecutors under Article 7, Paragraph 2 of anti-terror law.

<<7047.94;7063.5;en>>
So again, you can easily be charged for making terrorist propaganda, as happened in a peace petitioner's case when they invited the government to seize human rights violations.

<<7063.5;7072.3;en>>
In this case, at the beginning, 19 of charges were terrorist propaganda.

<<7072.3;7082.82;en>>
But when the prosecutor brought the case, it converted the case from a propaganda case to a membership case.

<<7082.82;7094.66;en>>
This is very important, because it brings us to the question whether Article 10 should have been examined in the chamber judgment.

<<7094.66;7098.34;en>>
Yes, dear members of the court.

<<7098.34;7111.5;en>>
If an ordinary judicial system was working, the applicant will be prosecuted one by one for every speech he made.

<<7111.5;7121.38;en>>
And he could have had the chance to bring every violation to the Strasbourg court under Article 10.

<<7121.38;7138.26;en>>
Now, firstly, criminal courts, then the Constitutional Court, and finally, the chamber did not examine under which conditions, in which context, the applicants made those speeches.

<<7138.26;7148.16;en>>
Without defining this, you cannot decide that there was a reasonable suspicion of him having committed a crime.

<<7148.16;7163.62;en>>
Because if his speeches fall within under Article 10 of the convention, obviously, there can't be any reasonable suspicion about him having committed a crime.

<<7163.62;7166.06;en>>
Thank you for your patience.

<<7166.06;7171.66;en>>
And I'm now giving floor to Professor Başakcalı give other answers.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<7173.74;7174.86;en>>
I call Mrs. Çalı.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<7176.3;7179.46;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President,

<<7179.46;7180.94;en>>
dear members of the court.

<<7180.94;7188.06;en>>
I will address the rest of the questions, but perhaps also a very small factual reminder.

<<7188.06;7192.7;en>>
Mr. Demirtas, from day one, when he was asked questions,

<<7192.7;7203.3;en>>
when he appeared before the trial court, he raised the issue that Judge Nussberger highlighted here, and he said, I'm a member of Parliament, my political speech is engaged in what you're doing.

<<7203.3;7205.54;en>>
I'd like you to investigate this matter.

<<7205.54;7210.42;en>>
This is a prior matter to whatever you do, whatever criminal charges you bring against me.

<<7210.42;7227.98;en>>
Not a single prosecutor, not a single judge, including the Constitutional Court, has actually made that review or asked a question about whether any of these speeches actually fall under Article 83, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution.

<<7227.98;7241.74;en>>
Now, we have, when we read the government's submission on the number of other members of Parliament, such as five AKP and one MHB members, to be very frank with you, we have used our Internet resources.

<<7241.74;7254.78;en>>
We don't have access to everything in any file in Turkey, but we were not able to find a single media story or any piece of news about which AKP and MHB members of Parliament were sentenced, convicted.

<<7254.78;7263.3;en>>
I, to this day, do not have that information, and this is not an information that is publicly available to us.

<<7263.3;7267.14;en>>
We'd like to find out as well, as Judge Felice asked.

<<7267.14;7298.18;en>>
Now, one question is that we have serious doubts, and we would very much appreciate the government to answer whether any of the AKP and MHB members were sentenced, and if they were sentenced for things that engaged in freedom of expression, or whether they were charged with terrorist propaganda, or being a membership of a terrorist organization, or by assaulting the laws of assembly, or by assaulting the law on insulting the President, or by assaulting the law on insulting the Prime Minister.

<<7298.18;7301.9;en>>
These are the charges that have been brought against Mr. Demirtas,

<<7301.9;7309.78;en>>
and these are also the charges that have been brought against every single HDP member of Parliament.

<<7309.78;7312.62;en>>
So that comparison would be very helpful.

<<7312.62;7329.38;en>>
We do know that two members of the CHB, the first largest opposition party in Turkey, have also been charged, and they have been detained, and that information is publicly available on the Internet and in other public resources.

<<7329.38;7338.66;en>>
If a member of Parliament, Judge Felice, is detained, they cannot propose law, they cannot vote, they cannot participate in parliamentary activities in a meaningful way.

<<7338.66;7342.1;en>>
There is only one exception that we highlighted in our submission.

<<7342.1;7345.7;en>>
Mr. Demirtas wanted to ask a question to Parliament,

<<7345.7;7351.1;en>>
and this has created quite a lot of uncertainty because he had to hand-write a question.

<<7351.1;7353.22;en>>
There was a matter of whether this could be accepted.

<<7353.22;7355.94;en>>
His lawyers took a piece of paper from him.

<<7355.94;7358.74;en>>
They were trying to sort of take it to the Parliament and whatnot.

<<7358.74;7363.82;en>>
So there is one instance that he was writing a question to Parliament to be answered.

<<7363.82;7375.14;en>>
At the last time that we checked, that one question, so this is not proposing law or anything, it's just asking a question, that was never answered by the Parliament.

<<7375.14;7385.38;en>>
Now, voting by proxy, whether there is any European consensus on voting by proxy by members of Parliament who are detained?

<<7385.38;7386.94;en>>
I must say it's a difficult question.

<<7386.94;7388.82;en>>
I think it's a very unusual one to ask.

<<7388.82;7396.78;en>>
I don't know if Council of Europe member countries kind of think about when we detain our members of Parliament, should they be voting for proxy?

<<7396.78;7398.14;en>>
It's a hard question.

<<7398.14;7405.34;en>>
I really don't know the answer to that, and I don't know if people would ask such a question when engaging with members of Parliament.

<<7405.34;7409.66;en>>
So my answer to Judge Yougstel is that I do not know the answer to that.

<<7409.66;7418.18;en>>
But what we do know is that obviously detention is an extremely harsh measure, and when this measure is engaged, obviously there are alternatives.

<<7418.18;7429.54;en>>
There's the house arrests, and there are lots of other alternatives that I'm sure are very clearly laid out in every single European legislation, what is an alternative to detention.

<<7429.54;7452.06;en>>
Now, the final question or the final set of questions I will come back to, one has to do with this very unusual latest development about the conviction of Mr Demirtas from a separate trial by a panel of judges in Istanbul, and that happened recently.

<<7452.06;7467.38;en>>
Now, after this conviction has been fast-tracked and finalised, as we have shown, obviously the conviction time kicks in under Turkish law, so the clock starts ticking towards this conviction.

<<7467.38;7471.18;en>>
But under Turkish law, it is not possible to be...

<<7471.18;7482.62;en>>
Or it is absolutely possible, let's put it the other way, to be convicted and detained at the same time, because you're convicted for one crime, but you're detained for another.

<<7482.62;7489.46;en>>
So for quite some time, Mr Demirtas was detained from one crime and he was convicted for another one.

<<7489.46;7499.26;en>>
He was able to see all of his lawyers, his family members, as a detainee, even though his clock was ticking as a convicted person.

<<7499.26;7506.26;en>>
Now, Mr Demirtas's detention ended on 2 September 2019.

<<7506.26;7512.38;en>>
This is by the decision of the trial court to actually end this detention.

<<7512.38;7517.98;en>>
So since 2000 September 2019, Mr Demirtas is not detained.

<<7517.98;7522.78;en>>
His clock is ticking towards his conviction.

<<7522.78;7533.14;en>>
But Mr Demirtas was detained until 2 September 2019, and he was a detainee until that time.

<<7533.14;7538.3;en>>
Judge Harantunyan has refused to appear before a judge.

<<7538.3;7541.82;en>>
Our applicant hasn't refused to appear before a judge.

<<7541.82;7546.26;en>>
Before he was detained, he made speeches in Parliament.

<<7546.26;7552.66;en>>
I really like to emphasise this one more time, because the speeches are publicly available in and outside of Parliament.

<<7552.66;7560.34;en>>
In this very heated political debate in Turkey about the lifting of immunities, he said, we will fight this.

<<7560.34;7565.54;en>>
And when he was making this speech, this is political speech, and he said, well, we will fight this.

<<7565.54;7570.38;en>>
If people would like to take me by force, they can take me by force to a prosecutor.

<<7570.38;7572.94;en>>
I will not go willfully.

<<7572.94;7578.94;en>>
Now, this speech, as you see, has been used over and over again in the reasonings of the Turkish Constitutional Court as well.

<<7578.94;7582.02;en>>
This is political speech, dear members of the court.

<<7582.02;7590.78;en>>
Under Turkish law, if the prosecutor invites you, you can say, I am not willfully wanting to come.

<<7590.78;7594.74;en>>
The next stage is that you are forcefully brought before a prosecutor.

<<7594.74;7602.02;en>>
There is nothing interesting or important about the fact that you say, I do not wish to go to in front of a prosecutor.

<<7602.02;7609.46;en>>
The prosecutor has all the powers to actually bring you before him or herself.

<<7609.46;7616.02;en>>
This is, I think, a very clear explanation of this.

<<7616.02;7635.34;en>>
Finally, on the solution process, we highlighted in our submission the very significant omission also in the chamber judgment and in the Turkish constitutional judgment about this very important recent historical context.

<<7635.34;7639.86;en>>
There is a conflict in Turkey that has been going on for a very long time.

<<7639.86;7646.58;en>>
It has harmed, caused huge amounts of deaths, a lot of misery in the country.

<<7646.58;7647.98;en>>
This is absolutely correct.

<<7647.98;7658.22;en>>
But there was one time, a very recent part of our history, a couple of years, where there were a solution process, where there was actually peace talks.

<<7658.22;7665.14;en>>
And the collapse of this, of course, will be something that has to be discussed by historians and by researchers about how it ended.

<<7665.14;7681.26;en>>
But we have, I think, shown you that the way that it has ended and the way a legitimate democratic political party and its leader has been turned into a terrorist is a very clear temporal inference there.

<<7681.26;7681.26;en>>
I thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<7684.5;7686.94;en>>
Thank you. I call the government.

<<7686.94;7688.94;en>>
Mr. Talmon.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<7703.41;7711.37;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court, as Council opposite has already said, these are some

<<7711.37;7718.37;en>>
very difficult questions, difficult questions to answer in the short time available.

<<7718.37;7724.81;en>>
We will try to do our best to respond to your questions.

<<7724.81;7754.29;en>>
The government can confirm the numbers set out in paragraph 90 of our response that there have been five AK Party members being sentenced after the lifting of immunity, one MHP member has been sentenced, and 15 members of the main opposition party, CHP.

<<7754.29;7790.77;en>>
With regard to the question concerning Article 10 and whether it needs addressing, in line with the general reasoning of this court, when the court finds that there is reasonable suspicion of someone having committed a crime on the basis of statements made, this court refrains from also examining Article 10.

<<7790.77;7814.27;en>>
The government would subscribe to this legal view that there is no need to, and actually that it could lead to contradictory findings if, or it would actually not be possible because it could only find a violation of Article 2 by then denying your first finding that there has been a reasonable suspicion of a crime.

<<7814.27;7816.37;en>>
The two basically exclude each other.

<<7816.37;7839.33;en>>
If you are assessing a statement and on the one hand you say this statement actually establishes suspicion of a crime, then at the same time to rule that that very statement that basically founded the basis for reasonable suspicion of a crime is protected by freedom of speech, that to the government seems contradictory.

<<7839.33;7857.37;en>>
And that was also, of course, the line of reasoning the chamber was following because the chamber found that there was reasonable suspicion of the applicant having committed a crime and on that basis then found no reason to rule on Article 10.

<<7857.37;7875.11;en>>
With regard to the third question, whether the applicant could have proposed a law, we respectfully disagree with what the applicant has just said.

<<7875.11;7890.87;en>>
A member of parliament, even if detained, under the Turkish constitution can exercise any right that does not require his physical presence in the chamber.

<<7890.87;7898.41;en>>
So for example, a legislative proposal does not require physical presence in the chamber.

<<7898.41;7907.21;en>>
Addressing questions to the government, written questions to the government, does not require physical presence.

<<7907.21;7925.61;en>>
Calling for an investigation or instituting an inquiry also does not require physical presence and therefore could even be instituted by a member of parliament who is in pretrial detention.

<<7925.61;7937.17;en>>
With regard to the one question asked by the parliament, by the applicant, we were just told that this question was never answered.

<<7937.17;7938.77;en>>
And this is correct.

<<7938.77;7951.01;en>>
The question was not answered because the term of office of parliament during which this question was asked shortly thereafter came to an end.

<<7951.01;7962.25;en>>
And with the end of the session of parliament, also the requirement to answer parliamentary questions under Turkish law comes to an end.

<<7962.25;7972.45;en>>
So whatever parliamentary business cannot be conducted within basically one period of parliament will not be conducted in the next parliament.

<<7972.45;7979.07;en>>
This is usual practice probably in most parliaments in Europe.

<<7979.07;7998.57;en>>
With regard to just Yüksel's question, the government agrees with the applicant that a person can be detained as a convict and at the same time he can be detained in pretrial detention.

<<7998.57;8006.09;en>>
So we can have legally two legal statuses of that person.

<<8006.09;8034.61;en>>
We would like to add that the parallel status of a convict and a person in pretrial detention actually did not start in December of 2018 but started already on the 7th of September 2018 when the decision was rendered.

<<8034.61;8041.49;en>>
And this first instance decision was then later on confirmed on appeal.

<<8041.49;8047.61;en>>
But of course then the criminal conviction is served from the first judgment.

<<8047.61;8074.93;en>>
So what we have is a situation from the 7th of September 2018 to the 2nd of September 2019 where the applicant legally held two statuses at the same time, that of a criminal convict and as a person in pretrial detention.

<<8074.93;8081.69;en>>
I'm just also reminded that it is not the 11th of December but the 7th of December.

<<8081.69;8110.09;en>>
Now if I may, this opportunity also to respond to the allegation that was once again made here in reply to your questions that apparently the applicant's case was fast-tracked, so to speak, to get him really convicted before the European Court of Human Rights could actually rule, the chamber could actually rule.

<<8110.09;8120.37;en>>
We have submitted as additional documents to the court statistics of how long an appeals process takes.

<<8120.37;8140.89;en>>
And you can see from that statistics that actually there was no fast-tracking but actually in most cases there was basically a similar time spent on the appeal and actually in 17 cases in the statistics the appeal was heard even earlier than in the case of the applicant.

<<8140.89;8158.73;en>>
So there is no question of him being singled out and his case being fast-tracked to preempt whatever the chamber of this court would have said.

<<8158.73;8172.65;en>>
Let me now turn to the question concerning parliamentary non-liability and parliamentary immunity.

<<8172.65;8183.29;en>>
The government would agree that of course this provision, Article 83, Paragraph 1, cannot be understood literally.

<<8183.29;8191.53;en>>
You do not have to use the same words inside the chamber and outside the chamber.

<<8191.53;8209.81;en>>
But of course what is important in this context is the content of your statement and the government would respectfully invite the court to actually have a look at the statements and to see whether these are parliamentary statements.

<<8209.81;8231.45;en>>
We have had no evidence in front of this court or in front of any Turkish court that the applicant has pleaded that some of his statements that form part of the criminal proceedings would actually fall under Article 83, Paragraph 1.

<<8231.45;8236.97;en>>
This has not been raised in any proceedings before the Turkish court.

<<8236.97;8256.77;en>>
It has now been raised today but of course there is no evidence for you to decide this unless you want to investigate this as a court of first instance and compare speeches in parliament with the speeches that form part of the criminal proceedings.

<<8256.77;8271.97;en>>
As I said, I think it is of particular importance that this argument was never raised before the Turkish court and it was not raised before the Turkish constitutional court.

<<8271.97;8283.25;en>>
We would also agree that if you make a statement in parliament you can make a statement of the same content on social media or in a tweet.

<<8283.25;8309.13;en>>
Again, it is not the medium, it is the content which you would have to compare and see whether a similar statement, an identical statement was made in parliament before it was made outside parliament and then formed part of the criminal proceedings.

<<8309.13;8330.09;en>>
The government would submit in this context that the speeches forming part of the criminal proceedings did not relate to the parliamentary work of the applicant and were not made with that content in parliament.

<<8330.09;8339.37;en>>
Let me now move to the question of foreseeability and the procedural guarantees included.

<<8339.37;8357.53;en>>
This is a question that was raised several times also by Judge Aiki and by Judge Potocki and I hope I answer all your questions in one go.

<<8357.53;8380.67;en>>
The government would like to submit that for a very long time, and it was not possible for us to establish for exactly how long, there were no individual decisions taken by the Turkish parliament to lift immunity of individual members.

<<8380.67;8394.89;en>>
The idea was that in Turkish politics and in Turkish history, the lifting of immunity had very often been abused against parliamentarians.

<<8394.89;8405.25;en>>
For that reason, for quite a number of years, the general rule followed by parliament was not to lift any immunity at all.

<<8405.25;8408.13;en>>
So there were no individual decisions.

<<8408.13;8414.09;en>>
So the default rule is there is no immunity.

<<8414.09;8434.17;en>>
Now parliament then decided in light of the number of investigation files, not just against the ADP members, but also against other members of parliament, we have provided you with the statistics, how many investigation files for each party.

<<8434.17;8450.45;en>>
In light of the number of these investigation files, parliament then decided to lift in one go the immunity of all parliamentarians irrespective of party affiliation.

<<8450.45;8466.33;en>>
And if we talk about procedural guarantees, as a lawyer I can see a difference between an individual decision and a general decision, but it is the will of parliament to lift the immunity.

<<8466.33;8473.89;en>>
The law lifting immunity had under the Turkish constitution to be discussed twice in parliament.

<<8473.89;8477.61;en>>
There were two readings of this bill.

<<8477.61;8484.09;en>>
And as we showed, there was cross party support for the lifting of immunity.

<<8484.09;8488.05;en>>
So this was not an AK Party bill.

<<8488.05;8497.57;en>>
So actually the AK Party did not have the number of members in parliament with which this law was approved.

<<8497.57;8504.89;en>>
So this law was approved with the positive vote of opposition party members.

<<8504.89;8513.97;en>>
In this context, I would also like to remind the court in terms of foreseeability and procedural guarantees.

<<8513.97;8531.89;en>>
And on the 29th of July 2015, the then 80 HDP members of parliament actually petitioned parliament to lift their immunity in one decision.

<<8531.89;8550.01;en>>
Again without any individual consideration, but it was to be a general decision that the party members basically petitioned that lift our immunities in light of investigation files that had been filed.

<<8550.01;8575.21;en>>
And in this context, it is probably also again important to remind the court that before any breakdown of the solution process, before any of the speeches from the Turkish president that have been cited to you, before all this, 45 investigation files had been filed with regard to the applicant.

<<8575.21;8591.77;en>>
Before any political dispute between the various players in Turkey, 45 files had already been submitted to parliament for the lifting of immunity.

<<8591.77;8607.01;en>>
Let me turn to the question of the membership of a terrorist organization.

<<8607.01;8621.47;en>>
There are in Turkish law certain criteria by which the courts determine whether someone is a member of a terrorist organization.

<<8621.47;8625.89;en>>
In fact, there are four criteria here.

<<8625.89;8642.57;en>>
What is required is several acts undertaken on the orders or instructions of the leadership of a terrorist organization.

<<8642.57;8649.11;en>>
The second requirement is the intensity of the act, the importance of the act.

<<8649.11;8653.07;en>>
There's a certain threshold requirement.

<<8653.07;8659.69;en>>
Probably buying lunch for someone would not fall under that category.

<<8659.69;8661.91;en>>
Then we need continuous acts.

<<8661.91;8665.85;en>>
So one single act would not be enough.

<<8665.85;8669.39;en>>
So it's a continuity here that has to be shown.

<<8669.39;8672.59;en>>
And of course, there is the subjective element.

<<8672.59;8682.99;en>>
There must be will or intention on the part of the person concerned.

<<8682.99;8703.35;en>>
In this context, Judge Lutzberger asked also about the similarity of the tweets, the tweets that were sent from the HDP executive council account and the tweet by Mr. Karayalan, a

<<8703.35;8705.95;en>>
PKK leader.

<<8705.95;8716.43;en>>
Now, council opposite have claimed here in this chamber that this Karayalan tweet is a fake.

<<8716.43;8719.71;en>>
The government submits that this is not the case.

<<8719.71;8724.83;en>>
It has not been established by the trial courts that this is fake.

<<8724.83;8729.75;en>>
So there is no evidence that this tweet is fake.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<8736.53;8740.97;en>>
You have exceeded your time, but if you would like to conclude, you have.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<8741.0;8753.66;en>>
If you permit me to conclude, considering that our council opposite basically also had a little bit more time in the first round, perhaps.

<<8753.66;8760.92;en>>
And I hope it is to the benefit of members of the court that we answer the questions.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<8759.8;8762.72;en>>
I have given you more than the applicants.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<8763.7;8766.7;en>>
I'll try to be brief.

<<8766.7;8774.7;en>>
I just want to basically mention with regard to the procedural guarantees in the case of lifting of immunity.

<<8774.7;8791.26;en>>
Of course, we had a procedural guarantee that immunity is only lifted with regard to those files that had been with Parliament or with the other institutions mentioned in the law at the moment when Parliament decided.

<<8791.26;8798.42;en>>
So Parliament was aware of the files on which it decided to lift immunity.

<<8798.42;8807.9;en>>
With regard to procedural guarantees, I may, of course, also refer you to the ordinary procedural guarantees in the normal criminal process.

<<8810.66;8832.38;en>>
There was also one allegation made by counsel opposite that in the investigation files, it is mentioned that the applicant is accused of membership of a terrorist organization, but he is now being tried for running a terrorist organization.

<<8832.38;8839.5;en>>
What is important under Turkish law is the factual allegation.

<<8839.5;8849.08;en>>
The prosecutors are bound by the factual allegations they put to Parliament when they petition Parliament to lift immunity.

<<8849.08;8861.22;en>>
So it's the factual allegations and the evidence put to Parliament that has to form the basis of future proceedings.

<<8861.22;8868.78;en>>
The prosecutors may, however, change the legal assessment of the facts submitted to Parliament.

<<8868.78;8878.42;en>>
So especially if several files are then joined, on the basis of the joined facts, a different legal assessment may be appropriate.

<<8878.42;8886.94;en>>
This can explain the difference between membership and running of a terrorist organization.

<<8886.94;8888.54;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<8888.54;8891.38;en>>
I think this is all the government would like to submit.

<<8891.38;8891.38;en>>
I thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<8895.62;8896.62;en>>
Thank you.

<<8896.62;8901.92;en>>
I now invite the judges who have put questions to us for further clarification if they so wish, Vice President Nußberger.

[[Judge;Angelika Nußberger]]

<<8905.26;8906.26;en>>
Yes, thank you very much.

<<8906.26;8923.14;en>>
Indeed, I would like to have some clarification, because I understood now on my question about Article 83, Paragraph 1, that the applicants argue that it was raised both before the courts and before the Constitutional Court, and the government says it was not raised.

<<8923.14;8927.9;en>>
So is there any evidence you could resort to explain that to us?

<<8927.9;8944.54;en>>
My second question is, did I understand the government representative correctly that you said before the change of 83, Paragraph 2, there was a practice that individual withdrawal of immunity procedure was not used?

<<8944.54;8950.02;en>>
So if there was such a practice, could parliamentarians rely on such a practice?

<<8950.02;8963.2;en>>
And the third question concerns, once again, this procedural change of the procedural position in this withdrawal procedure.

<<8963.2;8969.86;en>>
I want to understand, did the individual have still a right to protest against it?

<<8969.86;8981.46;en>>
So did he have a right to protest against the withdrawal if being a member of the collective assessment, just in light of our Karácsony judgment?

<<8981.46;8982.66;en>>
That's what I want to mention.

<<8982.66;8982.66;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<8984.32;8985.36;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<8985.36;8987.52;en>>
Judge Eicke, clarification question.

[[Judge;Tim Eicke]]

<<8987.6;8989.66;en>>
Yes, just a clarification question.

<<8989.66;8999.0;en>>
Council for the government indicated the, I think it was a four stage test under Turkish law for assessing membership of a terrorist organization.

<<8999.0;9006.32;en>>
And the first one of that understood was several acts undertaken under the instruction of the leadership of a terrorist organization.

<<9006.32;9025.64;en>>
What you didn't tell us, and which would be helpful, I think, certainly to me, to understand better, is how does one know that the leadership of the organization under whose instructions one acts is, for criminal purposes in Turkey, or generally a terrorist organization?

<<9025.64;9025.64;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<9027.48;9027.98;en>>
Thank you.

<<9047.31;9048.52;en>>
I call the government.

<<9048.52;9054.02;en>>
Mr. Talmon.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<9061.29;9069.81;en>>
Of course, with regards to whether something has been not raised, it is very difficult for the government to produce any evidence.

<<9069.81;9075.45;en>>
I think this would be on the part of the applicant to produce that evidence.

<<9075.45;9102.79;en>>
With regards to the question of whether individual members of parliament could rely on that practice, I assume that with regard to every decision on whether immunity is lifted or not, the individual has no guarantee that parliament does not decide to lift his immunity.

<<9102.79;9114.51;en>>
So that over a couple of years' time, immunity has not been lifted does not automatically establish a right that immunity would no longer be lifted.

<<9114.51;9119.99;en>>
So I think, as I said before, immunity is a temporary bar.

<<9119.99;9132.69;en>>
And in this context, I perhaps would also like to reply to Council Opposites who speak about the retroactive lifting of immunity.

<<9132.69;9142.69;en>>
The lifting of immunity basically is always retroactive because it concerns acts that appeared before the lifting of immunity.

<<9142.69;9149.89;en>>
Something happens, then the petition is made to parliament to lift immunity, and then the decision is made to lift immunity.

<<9149.89;9157.27;en>>
So the moment the act is committed, nobody knows whether immunity is lifted or not.

<<9157.27;9163.57;en>>
This is something that happens afterwards, and it is up to parliament to make that decision.

<<9163.57;9189.93;en>>
And I think that parliament has decided for a number of years not to lift immunity cannot establish a legitimate expectation on the part of individual members of parliament that immunity would never ever be lifted.

<<9189.93;9203.25;en>>
With regards to the question of the terrorist organization raised by Jotz Eicke, this is the hen and the egg question.

<<9203.25;9207.73;en>>
How do we know that someone is a terrorist leader who gives instruction?

<<9207.73;9227.77;en>>
Of course, we know that certain organizations are considered terrorist organizations such as the PKK, that is accepted by the United Nations as a terrorist organization, that is accepted by the European Union as a terrorist organization.

<<9227.77;9238.15;en>>
And there are procedures in Turkish law involving the Turkish judiciary by which terrorist organizations are determined.

<<9238.15;9248.37;en>>
The government would be happy to provide further information in writing if that is what is required by the court in the briefness of the time.

<<9248.37;9249.63;en>>
This is all we can say on this question.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<9254.28;9257.44;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<9257.44;9263.82;en>>
There have been… Mr. Altıparmak, would you like to take the floor very briefly

<<9263.82;9267.04;en>>
to react to clarification questions?

[[Applicant;AP4]]

<<9267.3;9273.18;en>>
As to the question whether we have evidence, yes we have and we will submit to the court.

<<9273.18;9285.58;en>>
In every single case the applicant under trial, he submitted that his speeches for within the scope of paragraph one of article 83.

<<9285.58;9296.18;en>>
Not only in the case that is pending before the court, but also other cases that are pending in different courts in different places.

<<9296.18;9320.02;en>>
Indeed, lawyers of the applicant even asked the courts to appoint an expert to compare the speeches at the parliament and outside the parliament to decide whether this falls within paragraph one article 18, sorry 83 of the constitution.

<<9320.02;9323.54;en>>
So we will provide this information to you.

<<9323.54;9338.94;en>>
Secondly, yes on 29th of July 2019, 2015 members of HDP presented a petition to the parliament to lift the immunity.

<<9338.94;9354.26;en>>
But I draw your attention, this was a political movement because on 28th of July, as we submitted in our visual aids, the president made a speech.

<<9354.26;9360.46;en>>
He invited parliament to lift immunities of HDP members to send them into prison.

<<9360.46;9370.02;en>>
As a reaction, as a political protest, HDP MPs submitted this petition to the parliament.

<<9370.02;9381.34;en>>
And yes, of course, facts cannot be changed, but the legal definition of an act can be changed at the judicial process.

<<9381.34;9393.54;en>>
However, the applicant first prosecuted for terrorist propaganda, then it was converted to membership, then it became running a terrorist organization.

<<9393.54;9403.82;en>>
We are talking about someone who became a candidate in presidential elections, who was the leader of the second largest party in the country.

<<9403.82;9417.7;en>>
And according to the government, he ran a terrorist organization for 12 years, and the government and all authorities ignored and waited the lift of immunity.

<<9417.7;9420.82;en>>
This is completely implausible.

<<9420.82;9426.42;en>>
And then a fast track of the case before the court of appeal was real or not.

<<9427.74;9435.54;en>>
At the last moment, the government presented a document to you, but now you have our document before you.

<<9435.54;9441.06;en>>
So I think they cannot deny the numbers in that.

<<9441.06;9451.1;en>>
An ordinary appeal before the court of appeals in Istanbul continues more than 350 days.

<<9451.1;9467.38;en>>
And after the judgment of the chamber, in 40 days, the applicant's conviction in a separate trial was approved by the court at Istanbul.

<<9467.38;9477.66;en>>
The government doesn't make clear what is the content of the cases submitted in this list.

<<9477.66;9486.54;en>>
Normally, a court of appeal in Istanbul cannot decide about terrorist propaganda case in 40 days.

<<9486.54;9488.66;en>>
Now I give the floor to Professor Cella.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<9492.74;9493.74;en>>
Thank you.

<<9493.74;9499.22;en>>
Just a few points of clarifications from me.

<<9499.22;9505.62;en>>
Now, the government said that it is possible to propose a law.

<<9505.62;9511.46;en>>
You don't have to be physically in Parliament to actually do that.

<<9511.46;9514.7;en>>
This is a very abstract argument in many ways.

<<9514.7;9517.78;en>>
And there's one concrete example.

<<9517.78;9521.3;en>>
Mr. Demirtas wrote a speech that he

<<9521.3;9524.22;en>>
wanted to be read in Parliament on behalf of him.

<<9524.22;9529.14;en>>
So the way that this happens is that he's in detention in high security prison.

<<9529.14;9532.62;en>>
It's not that Mr. Demirtas has internet access, books,

<<9532.62;9535.02;en>>
and regular visitors.

<<9535.02;9536.74;en>>
He can only access lawyers.

<<9536.74;9538.3;en>>
He can only write things by hand.

<<9538.3;9540.18;en>>
And he passes these things on.

<<9540.18;9545.34;en>>
And even when he actually wrote a speech, the Parliament did not accept this piece of thing.

<<9545.34;9550.02;en>>
There was a huge difficulty of taking this document outside of prison.

<<9550.02;9556.1;en>>
These are all subject of pending court cases in domestic courts and in domestic constitutional courts.

<<9556.1;9559.62;en>>
So the story, the larger context, is much, much larger.

<<9559.62;9575.3;en>>
And there are lots of concrete evidence that the fact that you don't have to be physically in Parliament does not translate to anything concrete in the case and in a lot of other pending applications.

<<9575.3;9582.34;en>>
In the concept of who's a member of a terrorist organization, I also refer the court to Imret and Bakir judgments.

<<9582.34;9585.26;en>>
These are very recent judgments.

<<9585.26;9593.22;en>>
But it might also be helpful to go back in history just a little bit and maybe go back to the judgment of DTP.

<<9593.22;9607.1;en>>
This was a banning of a political party, a banning of a Kurdish political party case, where the court in great length discussed very similar issues that we are discussing here today way back in time.

<<9607.1;9611.74;en>>
I think you would also find the unforeseeability discussion.

<<9611.74;9613.9;en>>
What is a terrorist organization?

<<9613.9;9616.38;en>>
How do you get instructions and so on and so forth?

<<9616.38;9619.18;en>>
This sort of ambiguity is systematic.

<<9619.18;9627.34;en>>
And this is really running through the resources, the discussions of the court's case law for well over a decade.

<<9627.34;9637.1;en>>
Finally, on the question of instructions and this tweet and that the tweet's authenticity was not confirmed.

<<9637.1;9642.38;en>>
Now, the situation is respectfully slightly different.

<<9642.38;9645.5;en>>
Mr. Demirtas said this tweet is fake.

<<9645.5;9649.26;en>>
He's asked the court to verify its authenticity.

<<9649.26;9653.38;en>>
So he's demanded this, and the trial court hasn't done that.

<<9653.38;9656.74;en>>
So I think the argument is not that the tweet is real.

<<9656.74;9667.02;en>>
I think the more factually correct statement, if we go with the argument, is that its authenticity has never been verified.

<<9667.02;9686.14;en>>
This also goes with a lot of audio surveillance texts that you have read in the constitutional court judgments and respectfully, unfortunately, also in the chamber judgment, audio surveillance recordings about some conversations that took place in April 2013.

<<9686.14;9700.74;en>>
To this day, there is not a single verified authentic evidence that the speeches or the texts that you read relating to April 2013 are indeed the voice of Mr. Demirtas.

<<9700.74;9719.74;en>>
They were obtained through audio surveillance, and the courts to this day have not authenticated any of these audio surveillance tapes that the constitutional court and the chamber has used as evidence for detention of Mr. Demirtas.

<<9719.74;9719.74;en>>
I thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<9722.5;9725.5;en>>
Thank you. We have now come to the end of the hearing.

<<9725.5;9731.3;en>>
I thank the parties and the third party for their submissions and answers to the court's questions.

<<9731.3;9733.5;en>>
The court will now deliberate.

<<9733.5;9736.2;en>>
The judgment will be delivered later.

<<9736.2;9740.1;en>>
The parties will be informed of the date of delivery.

<<9740.1;9741.1;en>>
I declare the hearing closed.

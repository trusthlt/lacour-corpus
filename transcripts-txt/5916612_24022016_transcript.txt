La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<54.05;55.41;en>>
Please be seated.

<<63.14;71.38;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of J.K. and others versus Sweden.

<<71.38;87.3;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on 13 September 2012 under Article 34 of the Convention by three Iraqi nationals, Mr. J.K., his wife, and son.

<<87.3;97.34;en>>
The application was allocated to the fifth section of the court, pursuant to Rule 52, Paragraph 1 of the Rules of the Court.

<<97.34;123.08;en>>
On 4 June 2015, a chamber of that section declared the complaint concerning Article 3 of the Convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible and delivered a judgment in which it held that the implementation of the deputation order against the applicants would not give rise to a violation of Article 3.

<<123.08;143.69;en>>
On 25 August 2015, the applicants requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention, and the panel of the Grand Chamber accepted the request on 19 October 2015.

<<143.69;148.45;en>>
The government are represented by their agent, Mr. Anders Rönquist, ambassador, assisted by Mrs. Katarina Fabian, Mrs. Helen  Lindquist, Mrs. Alexandra Wilton Wahren, Mrs. Linda  Öman  Bristow, and Åsa Carlander Hemingway

<<143.69;148.45;en>>
advisors.

<<165.78;175.06;en>>
The applicants are represented by Mrs. Canela Skyfacos, counsel, assisted by Mrs. Åsa Nilsson, advisor.

<<175.06;179.85;en>>
I welcome the representatives in the name of the court.

<<179.85;189.39;en>>
I also welcome the groups of judges from Bulgaria, Kosovo, and Ukraine who are on a study visit to the court.

<<189.39;198.81;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and the representative of the applicants, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<198.81;206.06;en>>
Mrs. Skyfacos for the applicants will speak first, and then Mr. Rönquist for the government.

<<206.06;225.41;en>>
I would explain that in addition to interpreting in the two official languages of the court, English and French, interpreting into Albanian, Serbian, and Ukrainian has been authorized for the benefit of the groups of judges from Kosovo and Ukraine attending this hearing.

<<225.41;233.97;en>>
That interpreting is not arranged by the court, and no transcription of the oral translation will be included in the official record of the proceedings.

<<233.97;235.38;en>>
I call Mrs. Skyfacos.

<<235.38;235.38;en>>
You have the floor, please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<237.76;241.88;en>>
Thank you Mr. President, honourable members of the court.

<<241.88;253.02;en>>
We are gathered here today to find out whether Jäger and his family's expulsion orders would give a rise to, would give a breach against Article 3 of the Convention of Human Rights.

<<253.02;257.52;en>>
The main legal question in this case concerns the burden of proof.

<<257.52;262.44;en>>
We argue that this should shift and rest upon the Swedish government.

<<262.44;273.36;en>>
For my clients, this case ultimately concerns whether they will or will not face torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment upon a return to Iraq.

<<273.36;284.4;en>>
What we are trying to predict is whether Jäger and his family will face a treatment in relation to Article 3 of the Convention upon a return to his home country.

<<284.4;293.32;en>>
If the courts come to the wrong conclusion today, following the government's position in this matter, it will lead to the devastating consequences for my clients.

<<293.32;298.08;en>>
Before the court, we cannot stress enough that an incorrect result most likely will lead to the death of my clients.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<305.21;313.03;en>>
From the beginning of 1990s, our client, JK, ran a company in the construction and transport area.

<<313.03;321.21;en>>
2003, when the American troops entered Iraq, JK was exclusively contracted by them.

<<321.21;328.57;en>>
JK was working as a constructor, helping the American troops until 2008 in Iraq.

<<328.57;333.65;en>>
This is why the threats against JK and his family's lives started.

<<333.65;340.57;en>>
This is also the main reason to why JK and his family can't return to their homeland.

<<340.57;348.85;en>>
In 2004, it had become public knowledge in Baghdad that JK collaborated with the American troops.

<<348.85;352.89;en>>
After this, the threats from Al-Qaeda began.

<<352.89;358.79;en>>
JK, his family, and JK's employees were in danger.

<<358.79;366.37;en>>
Due to the collaboration, JK became victim of an assassination attempt in Baghdad, 2004.

<<366.37;371.43;en>>
JK was shot in his stomach, leg, and hand.

<<371.43;375.89;en>>
Unfortunately, this was just the beginning of the threats.

<<375.89;385.27;en>>
After this, which the court is well aware of, a series of violent action was directed towards JK and his family.

<<385.27;397.41;en>>
The Swedish authorities, as well as the fifth section of the court, have determined that JK has been exposed to ill treatment during 2004 to 2008.

<<397.41;407.33;en>>
The ill treatment in question includes everything from the murder of JK's daughter to the destruction of the family's home and the eternal chase after the family.

<<410.77;420.13;en>>
After 2008, the Swedish government, as well as the fifth section of the court, is questioning JK's statements.

<<420.13;426.05;en>>
After the murder on JK's daughter, he stopped working for the American troops.

<<426.05;431.29;en>>
The family moved around Baghdad in order to seek safe zones and hide.

<<431.29;437.89;en>>
While hiding, JK was notified that he was placed on the Al-Qaeda death list.

<<437.89;445.85;en>>
Due to JK's collaboration with the American troops, the domestic authorities in Iraq could not protect the family.

<<445.85;455.17;en>>
At the time, as well as in present time, the authorities were highly corrupt and infiltrated by Al-Qaeda members.

<<455.17;468.81;en>>
In 2010, JK saw a chance to highlight the situation and protect his family by telling everyone that the government officials could not protect him and other citizens from Al-Qaeda.

<<468.81;476.33;en>>
JK participated in a televised interview, together with representatives for the Iraqi government.

<<476.33;483.25;en>>
JK's own situation was discussed, and JK criticized the government.

<<483.25;495.69;en>>
The interview was broadcasted nationwide in Iraq on Al-Hara Channel, and the criticism led to that JK got the authorities against him.

<<495.69;501.61;en>>
After this, the applicants fled to Sweden and applied for international protection.

<<501.61;511.89;en>>
In September 2011, former neighbors notified the applicants that members of Al-Qaeda were still searching for them in Iraq.

<<511.89;514.03;en>>
At this time, Al-Qaeda also destroyed the applicant's house.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<518.15;525.39;en>>
The Swedish authorities, as well as the Fifth Section of the Court, has wrongfully stated that J.K., after 2008,

<<525.39;536.55;en>>
had not made it probable that he and his family have a well-founded fear of being subjected to protection from a treatment upon a return to Iraq.

<<536.55;538.89;en>>
If we look at the evidence that J.K.

<<538.89;546.15;en>>
relied to support his later need for protection, we can conclude that this material is credible.

<<546.15;548.49;en>>
J.K. has submitted a witness certificate

<<548.49;564.19;en>>
showing that al-Qaeda is still searching for them, a police report stating that his house had been destroyed in 2011, and also a recording of the debates that took place in international media.

<<564.19;574.65;en>>
The Swedish government stated that the police report and the witness certificate was of simple nature and could not be assigned any real value.

<<574.65;582.25;en>>
They also stated that the recording had been downloaded in 2008 and that J.K. had invoked the submitted evidence

<<582.25;584.55;en>>
late in the assignment process.

<<584.55;591.19;en>>
Therefore, they argued that J.K. had damaged his credibility.

<<591.19;612.99;en>>
Due to the ex officio inquiry principle that is well established in the Swedish law and which the government have accounted for in the latest observation, paragraph 50, the immigration court must take all relative circumstances into account and ensure that the investigation of a case is adequate and complete.

<<612.99;627.99;en>>
Even though the initial burden of proof rests upon the applicant, the obligation to elect and evaluate the relative facts is shared between the applicant and the immigration authorities and courts.

<<627.99;638.25;en>>
It is questionable what kind of investigation that was made in this matter to somehow confirm or deny the authenticity of the submitted evidence.

<<638.25;645.89;en>>
In this case, the Swedish authorities haven't made any effort to get the submitted evidence verified.

<<645.89;650.35;en>>
They have only stated that the documents were of simple nature.

<<650.35;664.71;en>>
Since they usually perform authentication of various documents large, we question whether the Swedish authorities in this case have acted in accordance with the inquiry principle.

<<664.71;676.91;en>>
In order to fulfill its obligation to investigate, the Swedish authorities should have contacted the Iraqi authorities to verify that J.K. was telling the truth.

<<676.91;683.51;en>>
The fact that he did not do so only leads to the conclusion that the Swedish government wanted to avoid the truth.

<<683.51;688.95;en>>
At least a verification of the given police report should have been done.

<<688.95;694.15;en>>
And why should the Swedish government have this extensive investigation burden?

<<694.15;699.35;en>>
As the courts understand, we have to do with unequal parties in this case.

<<699.35;702.21;en>>
J.K. is a man who fled from his home country.

<<702.21;710.39;en>>
His abilities to in a satisfactory way get the evidence verified are close to impossible.

<<710.39;718.21;en>>
The Swedish government, on the other hand, have an unrestricted financial resources and a wide network.

<<718.21;723.09;en>>
The parties are just as equal as David and Goliath.

<<723.09;730.49;en>>
Sweden has the ability to question their expert and to question the Swedish ambassador in order to get the documents verified.

<<730.49;734.41;en>>
This has been done in many other asylum cases.

<<734.41;744.69;en>>
It is interesting that the Immigration Office has not even developed why the submitted evidence were to be considered of simple nature.

<<744.69;748.31;en>>
We don't even know who did the evaluation.

<<748.31;756.99;en>>
It is also interesting that the Swedish government did not question the police report stating the death of J.K.'s daughter,

<<756.99;764.39;en>>
though they questioned the report showing that J.K.'s house was destroyed in 2011.

<<764.39;773.75;en>>
Due to the fact that the Swedish court, as well as the Sixth Section of this court, considers that J.K. is not credible in his testimony

<<773.75;781.25;en>>
because he initially did not mention some circumstances, J.K. did not get a sign with a proof-of-life provision

<<781.25;784.75;en>>
known as benefit of the doubt.

<<784.75;790.75;en>>
Is it correct that the Swedish authority totally dismissed what J.K. was referring to

<<790.75;796.29;en>>
only because he did some statements about his past late in the process?

<<796.29;802.55;en>>
If the courts agree to this, we would like to draw the court's attention to certain aspects.

<<802.55;811.73;en>>
During the primary investigation at the immigration office, the investigator did not pay attention to what J.K. was stated.

<<811.73;815.93;en>>
In the view of this, we tried to get an all-on hearing at the immigration court.

<<815.93;820.45;en>>
This we were not granted, and J.K. did not get the opportunity

<<820.45;825.25;en>>
to account for his statements and to strengthen his credibility.

<<825.25;833.39;en>>
After this, the government has then chose to assess the processed evidence separately.

<<833.39;843.15;en>>
They mean that evidence upon 2008 are credible and that until this point, the applicant can be given the benefit of the doubt.

<<843.15;847.45;en>>
We question this approach, since J.K. has put forward a coherent statement

<<847.45;855.25;en>>
reflecting what he and his family has been through during the time before as well after 2008.

<<855.25;868.85;en>>
With current evident theories, the court must see to the collumative evidence presented upon a case and when to do an evaluation of the submitted evidence.

<<868.85;872.09;en>>
The government should not be able to go cherry-picking and choose to rely on which evidence they find suitable.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<878.8;885.2;en>>
Moving on from the credibility assessment, in Toralia, the case Salashek v. Netherlands

<<885.2;895.54;en>>
states that it's the current situation in Iraq which are decisive and have to be considered in the court's assessment of the conditions.

<<895.54;914.62;en>>
In view of this, I want to begin by stating that it's remarkable that the Swedish government, despite available country information and despite orders from the court, have not developed or attached country information that is directly relevant to JK's primary need of protection.

<<914.62;924.5;en>>
This is remarkable, though, dissenting judge Supancic stated the following in the court's judgment from 4th of June, 2015.

<<924.5;940.64;en>>
The fact that someone had already been a direct victim of an attack of the sort described above should, in principle, lead this court to examine very carefully the unremitting danger to the applicants.

<<940.64;948.06;en>>
The Swedish government have, in relation to their attached information, focused on the general situation in Iraq.

<<948.06;960.3;en>>
They mean that the general situation, according to international reports, is not so serious as to cause a violation of Article III of the Convention by itself.

<<960.3;969.58;en>>
We would, however, like to address to the court that the current situation in Iraq are developing in a very worrying direction.

<<969.58;976.06;en>>
The government has stated that the general situation in Iraq is very problematic.

<<976.06;988.4;en>>
They have also stated that the situation has worsened after the American troops left 2011, considering the political tensions between Sunni and Shiite Muslims.

<<988.4;998.12;en>>
The government have confirmed that Baghdad is extremely violent with bomb attacks, other explosions, kidnappings, and execution.

<<998.12;1004.6;en>>
Despite this, the government mean that the situation in Iraq is not untrainable.

<<1004.6;1009.48;en>>
Submitted country information testifies on the opposite.

<<1009.48;1028.6;en>>
For example, recently published country information from Norway about the security situation in Baghdad shows that the capacity and integrity of the security and justice system currently has been weakened, and in some places, completely eroded.

<<1028.6;1039.24;en>>
An article by Institute for the Study of War from October 2015 also indicates that ISIS's next goal is set for Baghdad.

<<1039.24;1054.0;en>>
Regarding the government's provision concerning the legal system in Iraq and their willingness to make this appear as functioning, we also want to draw attention to the State Department's report on human rights in Iraq.

<<1054.0;1063.86;en>>
The report testifies, among other things, denial of fair and public trials and government corruption.

<<1063.86;1070.24;en>>
With this knowledge, it cannot be reasonable to send JK and his family back to Baghdad.

<<1070.24;1077.76;en>>
Our submitted country information testifies to an unsecure situation in Iraq.

<<1077.76;1085.12;en>>
The general situation is not the only foundation to why JK and his family cannot return to Iraq.

<<1085.12;1093.04;en>>
As mentioned earlier, JK had extensive cooperation with American troops until 2008.

<<1093.04;1104.56;en>>
This cooperation has been the reason to that JK and his family have been subjected to protective founding treatment, contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.

<<1104.56;1111.24;en>>
Swedish authorities argue that this cooperation was a danger before, but not now.

<<1111.24;1116.28;en>>
However, there is evidence to the contrary.

<<1116.28;1125.4;en>>
Submitted country information suggests that former employees of American troops are sitting in a vulnerable situation.

<<1125.4;1133.24;en>>
Besides being seen as traitors to their homeland by al-Qaeda, ISIS are also a threat.

<<1133.24;1142.4;en>>
Filed country information testifies that ISIS sees former employees to American troops as direct targets.

<<1142.4;1149.62;en>>
A lot of former collaborators have lost their lives in areas that ISIS has taken control of.

<<1149.62;1158.08;en>>
Already in 2007, the American government realized the danger former collaborators were facing in Iraq.

<<1158.08;1164.92;en>>
Therefore, they provided an opportunity for them to apply for a special immigrant visa.

<<1164.92;1173.56;en>>
These visas were issued to prevent former collaborators from receiving threats against their lives.

<<1173.56;1183.24;en>>
Our submitted country information shows that further special immigrant visas are still justified for former collaborators.

<<1183.24;1203.88;en>>
In Vilvaraia and others versus United Kingdom, it has been determined that when an assessment of a person's ground for asylum takes place, this assessment shall be done based on the general situation in the home country, together with the applicant's individual reasons.

<<1203.88;1213.28;en>>
In order to make a correct assessment, it's important that the country information concerning the applicant's individual reasons is taken into consideration.

<<1213.28;1223.2;en>>
Swedish authorities have stated that it's almost seven years since JK and his family were exposed to protection founding treatment.

<<1223.2;1240.28;en>>
They mean that it's not likely that al-Qaeda still has an interest in them due to this, even though filed and submitted evidence shows that al-Qaeda and ISIS doesn't take the time aspect into account.

<<1240.28;1250.84;en>>
The Swedish government have not submitted evidence showing that if you once were put on the al-Qaeda death list, you get deleted from this list after a while.

<<1250.84;1263.12;en>>
The article from Wall Street Journal that we submitted also shows that collaborators, long after the termination of their employment, are living under a constant threat.

<<1263.12;1278.36;en>>
The Swedish government has in their observations, paragraph 65, concluded that al-Qaeda no longer operates in Baghdad and that they have not been punishing those who has been working and cooperating with American troops.

<<1278.36;1283.16;en>>
Our submitted country information give witness to the opposite.

<<1284.04;1294.28;en>>
Overall, our attached country information shows that JK and his family forthcoming have to fear for their lives upon their return.

<<1294.28;1304.08;en>>
They have to fear for their lives upon their return to Iraq, especially due to JK's former collaboration with the American troops.

<<1304.08;1306.16;en>>
JK and his family belongs to an especially vulnerable group.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<1312.05;1316.97;en>>
We have now come to the part of this pleading that concerns the basis of our appeal.

<<1316.97;1330.05;en>>
Throughout the proceeding of this case, the Swedish Government, as well as the Fifth Section of this Court, has made a wrongful decision by placing the entire burden upon my clients.

<<1330.05;1340.53;en>>
The Swedish Government and the Fifth Section of the Court had done so without taking into account the e-treatment that Jake and his family already suffered.

<<1340.53;1351.17;en>>
In our request for appeal to the Grand Chamber, we stated that the burden of proof in this specific case should not follow the general rule that otherwise applies in asylum cases.

<<1351.17;1360.33;en>>
The initial burden of proof for protection against e-treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention lies upon the applicant.

<<1360.33;1366.05;en>>
In this case, though, it is already determined that Jake and his family had been subjected to e-treatment.

<<1366.05;1377.27;en>>
Therefore, the burden of proof showing that the family would not be exposed to further e-treatment upon return to Iraq should rest on the departing States.

<<1377.27;1381.09;en>>
I have built this thesis on three grounds.

<<1381.09;1389.17;en>>
Firstly, Article 4.4 of the Nekonsa Directive, 2011-95 EU, this rule states that the fact

<<1389.17;1403.37;en>>
that the applicant already has been subjected to prosecution, other serious harm or direct threats of such prosecution or harm, are a serious indication that the applicant's fear of prosecution is well-founded.

<<1403.37;1420.81;en>>
In this case, there is a real risk that the person will suffer serious harm unless there is good reasons to consider that such prosecution or serious harm will not be repeated.

<<1420.81;1424.61;en>>
Secondly, case law testifies to this.

<<1424.61;1428.69;en>>
In this matter, I especially think of Arsic v. Sweden.

<<1428.69;1439.71;en>>
In this case, they called here that the burden of proof should be shifted to the expanding States since Arsic had shown that he had been exposed to torture in his home country.

<<1439.71;1445.45;en>>
These tortures strongly indicated uncontinual e-treatment.

<<1445.45;1458.81;en>>
The Swedish government has stated in their submitted observation that our case and Arsic v. Sweden are not compared more, since the e-treatment Arsic suffered was torture and

<<1458.81;1465.45;en>>
which had been committed by the State officials.

<<1465.45;1472.61;en>>
As stated in HLR v. France, it doesn't matter whether the danger emerates from persons or

<<1472.61;1477.13;en>>
from group of persons who are not public officials.

<<1477.13;1486.53;en>>
In our case, the Swedish government has determined that Jake and his family had been exposed to protection found in treatment.

<<1486.53;1491.65;en>>
Because of this, our case is comparable with Arsic v. Sweden.

<<1491.65;1499.61;en>>
Thirdly, like the dissenting Judge Supancic, we argue that our case is a prima facie case.

<<1499.61;1509.05;en>>
The e-treatment that Jake and his family had been subjected to during 2004 to 2008 is already proven and accepted by the Swedish government.

<<1509.05;1522.27;en>>
The evidently fact that Jake and his family already suffered e-treatment should lead to the presumption of the ultimate fact, e-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.

<<1522.27;1532.49;en>>
This leads to the conclusion that the burden of proof and the risk of non-prosecution should be on the reporting state.

<<1532.49;1552.05;en>>
Summary, these three facts that I just counted for can't lead to another conclusion that my applicant's case, the burden of proof, should be shifted and switched to the Swedish government.

<<1552.05;1563.25;en>>
If the Court shares our view regarding the placement of the burden of proof, it must also be examined at which level the burden of proof should be placed on.

<<1563.25;1568.69;en>>
The Court is well aware of the various evidence burdens applicable in different cases.

<<1568.69;1574.33;en>>
For example, in civil law, a party has to be able to make their claims probable.

<<1574.33;1580.01;en>>
In criminal law, the prosecutor has to prove that something is beyond reasonable doubt.

<<1580.01;1586.41;en>>
In our case, we argue that the Swedish government's burden of proof level should be as high as in criminal law.

<<1586.41;1589.41;en>>
And why is this?

<<1589.41;1597.71;en>>
Well due to the fact that the protection against e-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention are imperatively right.

<<1597.71;1607.93;en>>
A decision of expulsion may give rise to an issue under Article 3 and hence engends the responsibility of the State under the Convention.

<<1607.93;1624.29;en>>
Concerning the fact that a prohibition of torture is general and without exceptions, it is not more than reasonable that the government have to show that it's beyond reasonable doubt that my client is not facing e-treatment upon return.

<<1624.29;1637.09;en>>
If my client is sent back and do face e-treatment, or in worst case, death, it was not only be contrary to the Conviction.

<<1637.09;1641.61;en>>
Matter of fact, there would be a breach against due congence.

<<1641.61;1650.49;en>>
The obligation to protect person from inhumane and degrading treatment applies erga omnes and this cannot be ignored.

<<1650.49;1661.21;en>>
Have the Swedish authorities been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt or even made it probable that Jäke and his family are not going to face e-treatment upon a return to Iraq?

<<1661.21;1664.05;en>>
No, they have not.

<<1664.05;1669.65;en>>
The contrary information that the Swedish government have submitted is not enough to reboot this.

<<1669.65;1679.69;en>>
The government has not, in a case-specific and individualized matter, presented evidence that contradicts what my client has put forward.

<<1679.69;1690.81;en>>
Almost every day media reports on continuing escalating violence in Iraq and the government tend to ignore this, taking support in contrary information that is not updated.

<<1690.81;1705.23;en>>
Our submitted evidence and our submitted contrary information must lead this Court to conclude that an expulsion order in this case are in fact a breach against Article 3 of the Convention of Human Rights.

<<1705.23;1711.55;en>>
With this appeal to the Court to choose the certain before the uncertain, I hereby conclude my proceeding.

<<1711.55;1711.55;en>>
Thank you Mr. President and Honourable Members of the Court.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<1717.21;1721.21;en>>
Thank you very much, Mrs. Skyfacos.

<<1721.21;1724.21;en>>
Now, Mr. Ambassador Rönquist, please, you have the floor.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<1731.21;1735.81;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<1735.81;1756.45;en>>
the case before the Grand Chamber concerns the issue of whether the applicant family would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention by Al-Qaeda due to the applicant husband's cooperation with the American forces until 2008.

<<1756.45;1770.49;en>>
It also concerns alleged risk of treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention by Iraqi authorities due to the applicant husband's participation in a televised public debate.

<<1770.49;1783.97;en>>
By way of introduction, the government would like to stress that as far as the facts of the present case are concerned, I will not go into them in detail as they are summarized in the court's judgment.

<<1783.97;1793.53;en>>
The government's written observations of 11th January give a full account of how the government views this case.

<<1793.53;1798.53;en>>
I therefore refer to the government's observations in extenso.

<<1798.53;1810.25;en>>
In the government's pleadings here today, I will demonstrate that the expulsion of the applicant family would not constitute a breach of Article 3 of the Convention.

<<1810.25;1837.69;en>>
The government would like to invite the court, when examining the case at hand, to assess and take full account of the effectiveness of the domestic procedures and avoid making a reassessment unless the assessment of the domestic authorities and courts is considered to have been inadequate or the outcome of the proceedings arbitrary.

<<1837.69;1841.13;en>>
Mr. President, firstly, I will expand

<<1841.13;1852.01;en>>
on the risks of treatment in breach of Article 3 that the applicant family has claimed they could be subjected to upon return to Iraq.

<<1852.01;1870.29;en>>
Secondly, I will address the issue to what extent an asylum seeker would normally be required to discharge a burden of proof in showing the existence of a real risk of being subjected to ill treatment contrary to Article 3 in the event of expulsion.

<<1870.29;1878.77;en>>
And in particular, to what extent the applicant family had such a burden of proof in the domestic proceedings.

<<1878.77;1881.53;en>>
Mr. President, firstly, as regards

<<1881.53;1893.05;en>>
the risk of treatment in breach of Article 3 that the applicant family has claimed they could be subjected to upon return to Iraq, it is relevant to note the following.

<<1893.05;1899.09;en>>
The applicants have stated that they have been persecuted by al-Qaeda in Iraq.

<<1899.09;1911.29;en>>
In their February submission, they also claimed that ISIS-Daesh has a particular interest in those who are accused of collaborating with the American forces.

<<1911.29;1932.21;en>>
They have also submitted that they could not seek protection from the domestic authorities in Iraq as people within the Iraqi authorities were in collaboration with al-Qaeda on a daily basis, and that the Iraqi authorities did not have the ability to protect the applicant husband.

<<1932.21;1948.33;en>>
However, the applicant husband has never sought any protection from the Iraqi authorities, and has therefore failed to show that he has been unable to attain protection from the domestic authorities.

<<1948.33;1951.57;en>>
Mr. President, the applicants have

<<1951.57;1967.05;en>>
claimed that due to the applicant husband's cooperation with the American forces until 2008, they have been subjected to persecution, and that this risk still remains.

<<1967.05;1977.57;en>>
They have thus not suffered any kind of persecution since the applicant husband stopped working for the American forces.

<<1977.57;1985.57;en>>
The government would like to point to the following information, which has been obtained from relevant country of origin information.

<<1985.57;2000.01;en>>
For example, the Migration Agency report on al-Qaeda in Iraq, and the Congressional Research Service on Islamic State and US Policy, both from December last year.

<<2000.01;2007.57;en>>
Al-Qaeda in Iraq was founded by al-Zarqawi in Iraq in 2003.

<<2007.57;2013.97;en>>
The organization was the origin of the international network of al-Qaeda.

<<2013.97;2033.09;en>>
The ultimate goal of al-Qaeda was to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region, and to encourage sectarian tensions, which would ultimately conquer the American occupying power in the country and overthrow the Shia government.

<<2033.09;2041.25;en>>
Daesh, on the other hand, is a transnational Sunni Islamist insurgent and terrorist group.

<<2041.25;2058.21;en>>
And the recent advancement of Daesh and aligned forces in the northwestern and central parts of Iraq has resulted in numerous civilian casualties and internally displaced persons.

<<2058.21;2078.37;en>>
Daesh persecutes Shia Muslims and religious minorities from seized Iraqi territory under its control, and in areas not under its control.

<<2078.37;2093.93;en>>
Even if the precise nature of Daesh's relationship to al-Qaeda from 2006 onward is unclear, Daesh differs from al-Qaeda both strategically and ideologically.

<<2093.93;2109.33;en>>
While al-Qaeda's primary enemy is the United States, the primary target of Daesh is rather what they consider to be apostate regimes in the Arab world.

<<2109.33;2117.93;en>>
When the American forces withdrew from Iraq in 2011, the conflict in Syria had already begun.

<<2117.93;2122.81;en>>
By that time, Daesh took the opportunity to grow.

<<2122.81;2146.37;en>>
According to recent country of origin information, Daesh is conducting a war against the state of Iraq by using asymmetrical warfare in the form of terrorist attacks mainly directed against Iraqi public officials and the Shiite civilian population.

<<2146.37;2172.15;en>>
In light of what has now been said, the government holds that country of origin information shows that the general situation in Baghdad in 2008 with groups of al-Qaeda threatening and punishing everyone cooperating or working with the Americans or Western forces is no longer at hand.

<<2172.15;2192.61;en>>
Instead, current country of origin information shows that the greatest threat in relation to the general situation in Baghdad today emanates from Daesh seeking to persecute Shia Muslims in general and other religious minorities.

<<2192.61;2208.21;en>>
In the applicant's case, the threats and the violence were closely connected to the applicant husband's cooperation with the American forces, as this cooperation has ceased since long.

<<2208.21;2213.01;en>>
The situation for the applicants has changed.

<<2213.01;2231.09;en>>
Furthermore, according to country of origin information, the Iraqi authorities are not today deemed to be infiltrated by terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda or Daesh, as suggested by the applicants.

<<2231.09;2241.89;en>>
These groups have their origins in Sunni extremist groups, while the authorities in Baghdad are dominated by the Shia community.

<<2241.89;2268.05;en>>
Thus, the government maintains in making a full and ex-nunk assessment that there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the applicants would face a real and individual risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention if the expulsion orders were implemented.

<<2268.05;2290.41;en>>
Should the Grand Chamber reach a different conclusion in this regard, the government leaves it to the court to assess whether an enforcement of the expulsion orders against the applicants to other parts of Iraq than Baghdad, the internal flight alternative, would be incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention.

<<2290.41;2298.57;en>>
It is only if this would be the case that the breach of Article 3 of the Convention could be ruled.

<<2298.57;2335.85;en>>
Secondly, with regard to the question of to what extent an asylum seeker would normally be required to discharge a burden of proof in showing the existence of a real risk of being subjected to ill treatment contrary to Article 3 in the event of expulsion, and in particular, to what extent the applicant family had such a burden of proof in the domestic proceedings, the government would like to submit the following.

<<2335.85;2359.05;en>>
Under the Convention, it is for the applicants to adjuce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that if removed to the country of destination, they would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3.

<<2359.05;2367.29;en>>
Where such evidence is adjuced, it is for the government to dispel any doubts about it.

<<2367.29;2379.29;en>>
Under Swedish asylum law, the burden of proof lies on the applicant who has to establish, to a reasonable degree, his or her grounds for protection.

<<2379.29;2392.61;en>>
It is the applicant himself or herself who should submit all relevant information for the assessment of his or her international protection.

<<2392.61;2404.29;en>>
According to the preparatory work to the Swedish Aliens Act, the standard of proof cannot be set too high for claims concerning the risk of persecution.

<<2404.29;2425.25;en>>
As it may be difficult for an applicant to substantiate all claims with written or other evidence, the obligation to elicit and evaluate the relevant facts is shared between the applicant and the migration authorities and courts.

<<2425.25;2434.33;en>>
The migration authorities and courts must ensure that the investigation of the case is adequate and complete.

<<2434.33;2449.65;en>>
Furthermore, it may be reiterated that under Swedish asylum law, the standard of proof is lower compared to other administrative cases in view of the application of the benefit of the doubt.

<<2449.65;2473.81;en>>
However, a prerequisite for giving the applicant this benefit is that the applicant has told the truth and assisted the examiner to the full in establishing the facts of his or her case, and that the examiner is satisfied as to the applicant's general credibility.

<<2473.81;2483.13;en>>
In this regard, the applicant's statements must be coherent and not contradictory.

<<2483.13;2504.49;en>>
It follows from Swedish case law and the preparatory works of the Aliens Act that the assessment of whether an applicant fulfills the condition to become a refugee is forward-looking and based primarily on the risk of persecution upon return to the home country.

<<2504.49;2526.97;en>>
It also follows from the qualification directive that this assessment is to be carried out on an individual basis while taking into account all relevant facts as they relate to country of origin information at the time of taking a decision on the application.

<<2526.97;2542.97;en>>
An indication that such a risk of persecution exists is that the applicant seeking asylum has been subjected to persecution previously, although this is not by itself enough.

<<2542.97;2558.89;en>>
It is also required that the abuse that has constituted grounds for the persecution in the home country is still relevant and that there are grounds for believing that such persecution will be repeated.

<<2558.89;2569.33;en>>
In the government's view, the domestic migrations authorities have not applied an excessive burden of proof on the applicants.

<<2569.33;2581.41;en>>
The applicant husband has, in a forward-looking risk assessment, not substantiated that he and his family are in need of protection today.

<<2581.41;2596.21;en>>
As I have already underlined, the greatest threat in relation to the general situation in Baghdad today emanates mainly from Daesh seeking to exterminate Shia Muslims and other religious minorities.

<<2596.21;2607.45;en>>
However, in the applicant's case, the threats and the violence were closely connected to the applicant husband's cooperation with the American forces.

<<2607.45;2615.85;en>>
Thus, as this cooperation has ceased, the situation for the applicants have now changed.

<<2615.85;2633.17;en>>
The government also notes that the applicants continued to live in Iraq also after 2008 until 2010.

<<2633.17;2639.05;en>>
Mr. President, ought, as argued in his dissenting opinion

<<2639.05;2659.57;en>>
by Judge Szczepansik in this chamber judgment, the unfortunate past experiences of the applicants in this case be perceived as a concrete basis for the inference that something comparable is likely to happen to them upon being expelled to Iraq.

<<2659.57;2675.93;en>>
Indeed, the fact that an applicant has already been a victim of persecution should, in principle, lead to a very careful examination of the unremitting danger that he or she faces upon return.

<<2675.93;2686.29;en>>
This does, however, not mean that the burden of proof for any future risk that applicant might face should be on the state.

<<2686.29;2699.37;en>>
It is simply not conceivable for a state to prove that an applicant will not, on their return, be subjected to conditions or situations which would contravene Article 3.

<<2699.37;2719.73;en>>
Instead, it is, as stated by the chamber's majority, in principle, for the applicants to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that they would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3.

<<2719.73;2724.89;en>>
In this regard, the government would like to point to the following.

<<2724.89;2740.13;en>>
Firstly, as regards to the claim that the applicant husband had participated in a TV debate in 2008, this was mentioned for the first time in the national proceedings before the Migration Court.

<<2740.13;2756.61;en>>
In the written appeal to the Migration Court of Appeal, as well as in a later application for a re-examination before the Migration Agency, the applicant stated that it took place in February 2010.

<<2756.61;2773.49;en>>
Secondly, it was not until the applicants were denied residence permits by the Swedish Migration Agency that they claimed that al-Qaeda had searched for the applicant husband and that their house in Baghdad had been burnt down.

<<2773.49;2791.41;en>>
The government notes that had the applicants felt that the claims now invoked were crucial to their asylum claim, it could reasonably be expected of them to present their claims at a much earlier stage of the domestic proceedings.

<<2791.41;2803.93;en>>
Moreover, the applicants have claimed that Sweden made no effort to investigate the evidence that they submitted by, for example, contacting the Iraqi authorities.

<<2803.93;2824.13;en>>
The government notes that the evidence, the DVD submitted by the applicant husband to substantiate that he would risk persecution by the Iraqi authorities, clearly displays that the recording was not made after the 4th of March 2008.

<<2824.13;2848.25;en>>
The government notes that the chamber of the court agreed with the Swedish authorities that the applicants had failed to substantiate that the recording was made after 4th of March 2008, and notably that the applicant husband now also risks being persecuted by the Iraqi authorities on account of this.

<<2848.25;2856.37;en>>
It is also important to note that the documents submitted by the applicants were translated by the migration court.

<<2856.37;2865.13;en>>
From the translation, it was evident that the police report rather was issued as a proof of residence.

<<2865.13;2875.05;en>>
It was also lacking in detail about who the perpetrators might have been and how this information had been retrieved.

<<2875.05;2881.97;en>>
The witness certificate did not indicate who had been searching for the applicant husband.

<<2881.97;2891.65;en>>
Also, two different home addresses of the applicants were indicated on the witness certificate and the police report.

<<2891.65;2903.85;en>>
Both the witness certificate and the police report submitted by the applicants were of a simple nature and thus had a low value as evidence.

<<2903.85;2911.69;en>>
Accordingly, there was no reason for the domestic authorities and courts to further investigate the case.

<<2911.69;2925.21;en>>
The government holds that the Swedish authorities ensured that the case was investigated to the extent its nature so required in accordance with Swedish legislation.

<<2925.21;2945.85;en>>
The government thus argues that it would be too far-reaching if all claims or documents in support thereof automatically would require the state to investigate such claims further, for example, by contacting the authorities in the applicant's country of origin.

<<2945.85;2966.73;en>>
In accordance with established Swedish case law and the qualifications directive, as the applicant's asylum account was incoherent and contradictory, they could not be given the benefit of the doubt in the forward-looking risk assessment, which had to be made by the domestic authorities.

<<2966.73;2977.61;en>>
In view of the above, the impunged domestic decisions did not imply that an excessive burden of proof had been placed on the applicants.

<<2977.61;2997.89;en>>
Thus, there is nothing to suggest that the proceedings before the national authorities lacked effective guarantees to protect the applicants against arbitrary reform, or that the outcome of domestic proceedings was arbitrary in any way, or amounted to a denial of justice.

<<2997.89;3013.69;en>>
It is also important to note that the decisions by the domestic authorities and courts were taken in accordance with the domestic case law from the Migration Court of Appeal and the Swedish Migration Agency's handbook.

<<3013.69;3016.67;en>>
Mr. President, I would also like briefly

<<3016.67;3037.89;en>>
to address the question as to what extent an applicant who alleges a real risk of being subjected to ill treatment contrary to Article 3 in the event of expulsion would normally be required to discharge a burden of proof in showing the existence of such a risk before the court.

<<3037.89;3046.37;en>>
The applicants have relied upon the court's chamber judgment of 9 March 2010 in the case Arsi v. Sweden.

<<3046.37;3068.61;en>>
That case referred to risk for torture by Iranian authorities and the specific risk facing Iranians returning to Iran without being able to produce evidence that they had left Iran legally, and therefore had come to the attention of the Iranian authorities.

<<3068.61;3076.37;en>>
The government holds that the present case is clearly distinguishable from that of Arsi v. Sweden,

<<3076.37;3093.01;en>>
mainly as that case concerned an applicant alleging that he had suffered torture in the hands of the authorities, while the present case concerns an applicant who has suffered persecution by a non-state actor.

<<3093.01;3101.85;en>>
Moreover, in the present case, the situation in the applicant's country of origin has changed since they left.

<<3101.85;3111.29;en>>
Thus, they would no longer risk the same kind of persecution, which is also supported by the country of origin information referred to by the government.

<<3115.53;3119.35;en>>
Mr. President, as regards the applicant's demand

<<3119.35;3133.57;en>>
for just satisfaction, the applicants claim compensation for non-pecuniary damages in the amount of 20,000 euros each for their physical suffering.

<<3133.57;3147.17;en>>
The applicants further claim that they should be compensated for pecuniary damages in the amount of 10,000 euro each as a result of the violation they have suffered.

<<3147.17;3155.61;en>>
The government reiterates that as long as the expulsion order is not enforced, no damage can arise.

<<3155.61;3162.97;en>>
And also, the applicant's claim for damages should therefore be dismissed.

<<3162.97;3177.93;en>>
Further, the applicants claim compensation for costs and expenses totaling Swedish kronor 144,180, relating to the costs before the grand chamber.

<<3177.93;3194.21;en>>
As the court has repeatedly stated, an award under this head may be made only insofar as the costs and expenses were actually and necessarily incurred in order to avoid or obtain redress for the violation found.

<<3194.21;3197.89;en>>
And they must be reasonable as to quantum.

<<3197.89;3211.93;en>>
The government notes that the Swedish hourly legal aid fee for 2016 is Swedish kronor 1,653, VAT included.

<<3211.93;3222.41;en>>
The government holds that a reasonable amount as compensation for costs before the grand chamber should not exceed 30 hours work by their counsel.

<<3225.05;3227.77;en>>
Finally, Mr. President, let me just

<<3227.77;3239.17;en>>
draw the grand chamber's attention to the fact that the decision to expel the applicant family will become statute barred on 9 August this year.

<<3239.17;3249.33;en>>
In view of this, the government would like to stress the importance that the grand chamber decides the case in good time before that date.

<<3249.33;3252.05;en>>
In concluding, Mr. President, the government

<<3252.05;3260.77;en>>
invites the court to hold that there has been no violation of article three of the convention in the present case.

<<3260.77;3263.23;en>>
I thank you, Mr. President, distinguished members

<<3263.23;3263.49;en>>
of the court.

Now I turn to my colleagues in order to invite them to put questions to the parties.

<<3279.92;3280.68;en>>
Do they have any?

<<3285.51;3286.95;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<3286.95;3289.79;en>>
I also thank the parties for their interventions.

<<3289.79;3291.99;en>>
I have a question to the government.

<<3291.99;3297.39;en>>
You have stated here that you have laws in Sweden that protect the migrants.

<<3297.39;3304.59;en>>
You have quoted here the Swedish law on migration, the Swedish law for aliens, the preparatory work for aliens.

<<3304.59;3330.62;en>>
But you didn't mention here if you have relevant national or policy guidelines that indicate general practice regarding the burden of proof of asylum seeker, namely more concrete, if you have certain indication to give in advance to asylum seeker, how they have to formulate the police advice for their own countries, namely for Iraq, because your migration board find that this is not satisfactory for Sweden.

<<3330.62;3343.31;en>>
Do you know exactly how this have to be given, how many witnesses have to be there, how much, how many indication the police had to give in the concrete case for each country, or this depends for case to case?

<<3343.31;3344.51;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<3345.07;3347.07;en>>

Please be seated.

<<3481.04;3485.32;en>>
The hearing is now resumed and I call Mrs. Skyfacos.

<<3485.32;3485.32;en>>
You have the floor please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<3487.49;3491.25;en>>
Thank you Mr. President, honourable members of the court.

<<3491.25;3496.57;en>>
Mr. President, the Swedish government has in their pleading stated that ISIS is no longer

<<3496.57;3502.25;en>>
a threat towards my clients.

<<3502.25;3506.25;en>>
Our submitted comfort information testifies to the contrary.

<<3506.25;3519.53;en>>
It testifies among other things that former interpreters and collaborators have suffered ill-treatment by members of ISIS when ISIS has taken control over a certain area in Iraq.

<<3519.53;3530.21;en>>
They have searched for these persons and tried to get them killed and they did not get them like a herring in the court.

<<3530.21;3532.29;en>>
They just found them and killed them.

<<3532.29;3541.77;en>>
And our submitted comfort information testifies to that devastating destiny of former interpreters and collaborators to the American forces.

<<3541.77;3554.13;en>>
It is also common knowledge that ISIS is a branch of former Al-Qaeda and it's common knowledge that former members of Al-Qaeda do operate in Baghdad together with ISIS members.

<<3554.13;3564.65;en>>
They have been Al-Qaeda members but are now in the position of being ISIS members.

<<3564.65;3570.13;en>>
They just shifted the group on which they work within.

<<3570.13;3570.13;en>>
And that's it.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<3573.57;3587.75;en>>
Regarding the protection from the authorities, our applicant could not seek protection from the authorities out of fear that his address would be revealed and that his family would be in further danger.

<<3587.75;3597.75;en>>
The government have commented in their pleadings that my client was not a victim of ill treatment between 2008 and 2010.

<<3597.75;3597.75;en>>
This was only because they were in hiding during that time.

And I don't understand why the Swedish government find this questionable, why he was not suffered, why he didn't suffer a treatment between 2008 and 2010, when in fact my client told everybody that he was hiding and moving around in Baghdad and his son didn't even go to school, they didn't leave their house.

<<3622.22;3635.51;en>>
And if you see how common people that is trying to avoid to be prosecuted by state officials, they can hide in years without the police finding them and searching for them.

<<3635.51;3647.82;en>>
So I don't understand why the government feels this so remarkable that he indeed did hide and was not found by the Al-Qaeda members.

<<3647.82;3670.51;en>>
And he didn't want to seek the international protection because he was afraid of, that if he made a statement of ill-treatment to the government officials, then he had to reveal his current address and then his family would be in risk even more because then it would be possible for Al-Qaeda to find him.

<<3670.51;3678.91;en>>
Al-Qaeda did infiltrate the state officials in Iraq and they did also corrupt the state officials.

<<3678.91;3681.22;en>>
That can be no secret to the Syrian government.

<<3681.22;3693.41;en>>
Regarding the comparison of Russia versus Sweden, in our case, we have already commented on this aspect, so we will not go into this further.

<<3693.41;3705.41;en>>
I do notice that the Swedish government did comment on the police report that we submitted stating that Jake's house had been burned down by Al-Qaeda members.

<<3705.41;3718.41;en>>
They said that you couldn't read from the police report who burned down the house.

<<3718.41;3737.41;en>>
But we say, as we already said in 2012, to the immigration court, that it does say, by the document that we submitted, it does say who committed, who burned down the applicant's house.

<<3737.41;3739.72;en>>
And it does say that it was Al-Qaeda.

<<3739.72;3748.91;en>>
And regarding the fact that there were two addresses, as we already told the court, my client did not live in this house that was destroyed.

<<3748.91;3756.41;en>>
He had moved around in Baghdad, and that's why there were two different addresses in the police report.

<<3756.41;3763.41;en>>
Regarding the cost of the bill, Mr. Landahl has commented that he sees it unreasonable

<<3763.41;3770.41;en>>
that we claim that we have submitted of 78 hours.

<<3770.41;3780.91;en>>
But if we look to our side of the table and we look at Runqvist's side of the table, there are six persons and we are two persons.

<<3780.91;3784.41;en>>
So I wonder how many hours did you spend on your cost of bills.

<<3784.41;3790.41;en>>
I'm sure of that you have extended my costs by far.

<<3790.41;3791.41;en>>
Thank you Mr. President, Honourable Members of the Court.

<<3796.95;3798.95;en>>
Thank you Mrs. Nilsson.

<<3798.95;3801.95;en>>
And now Mr. Ambassador Rönquist, you have the floor please.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<3805.05;3808.97;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<3808.97;3818.53;en>>
let me first turn to the question of Judge Mottok on the questions of burden of proof and rules on evidence according to the Swedish system.

<<3821.01;3843.25;en>>
Two fundamental principles in Swedish evidential law is the principle of free sifting of evidence and the principle of free evaluation of evidence, which are outlined in the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure and in the Administrative Procedures Act.

<<3843.25;3853.39;en>>
According to the principle of free sifting of evidence, there are no legal limitations on what evidence a party can invoke.

<<3853.39;3867.77;en>>
The principle of free evaluation of evidence means that authorities and courts are free to evaluate submitted evidence without regards to any rules in law.

<<3867.77;3877.37;en>>
These principles, when it comes to asylum cases, are further elaborated in the Swedish Migration Agency's Handbook on Asylum Cases.

<<3885.17;3901.15;en>>
The ex officio inquiry principle in Swedish law requires the Swedish administrative courts to ensure that a case is investigated to the extent its nature so requires.

<<3901.15;3924.01;en>>
The principle is explicitly outlined in the Administrative Procedures Act, which means that it only applies to administrative courts, such as the migration courts, but should also be applied by administrative authorities, such as the Swedish Migration Board, according to customary law.

<<3924.01;3926.89;en>>
Mr. President, the representatives

<<3926.89;3930.45;en>>
of the applicants refer to Article 4.4

<<3930.45;3933.97;en>>
in the qualification directive.

<<3933.97;3955.13;en>>
It is true that that article states that the fact that an applicant has already been subject to persecution or serious harm is a serious indication of the applicant's well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm.

<<3955.13;3968.25;en>>
This, however, only applies if there are no good reasons to consider that such persecution or serious harm will not be repeated.

<<3968.25;3977.09;en>>
In this case, there are good reasons to consider that the persecution will not be repeated.

<<3977.09;3984.73;en>>
Firstly, a long time has passed since they suffered ill treatment.

<<3984.73;3995.61;en>>
Secondly, and this is of most importance, the security situation in the applicant's country of origin has changed.

<<3995.61;4012.81;en>>
As the government already stated, according to the country information, the Iraqi authorities are not today deemed to be infiltrated by terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda or Daesh.

<<4012.81;4025.09;en>>
Recent country of origin information does not support that former collaborators of the US forces are direct targets of Daesh.

<<4025.09;4032.09;en>>
Instead, Daesh target mainly Christians and other religious groups.

<<4032.09;4037.61;en>>
Yazidis is the most exposed group.

<<4037.61;4044.37;en>>
Thus, the applicant would no longer risk the same kind of persecution.

<<4044.37;4055.49;en>>
This means that in this case, past persecution is not a serious indication of the risk of future persecution.

<<4055.49;4064.65;en>>
Finally, it is the situation for the individuals in this case which should be the basis for the assessment.

<<4064.65;4066.37;en>>
I thank you very much, Mr. President,

<<4066.37;4067.61;en>>
distinguished members of the court.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4069.07;4071.79;en>>
Thank you very much, Ambassador.

<<4071.79;4075.71;en>>
We have now come to the end of the hearing.

<<4075.71;4082.47;en>>
I thank the parties for their interventions and answers to the question of the court.

<<4082.47;4085.69;en>>
The court will now deliberate on the merits.

<<4085.69;4088.51;en>>
The judgment will be delivered later.

<<4088.51;4091.83;en>>
The parties will be informed of the date of delivery.

<<4091.83;4091.83;en>>
I declare the hearing closed.

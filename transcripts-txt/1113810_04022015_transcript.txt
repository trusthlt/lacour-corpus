La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<51.53;52.77;en>>
Please be seated.

<<58.73;66.93;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the admissibility and merits in the case of Mozer against the Republic of Moldova and Russia.

<<66.93;76.71;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on the 24th of February, 2010, under Article 34 of the Convention by Moldova national, Mr. Boris Mozer.

<<76.71;90.29;en>>
The application was allocated to the third section, which on the 20th of May, 2014, decided to relinquish jurisdiction in favor of the Grand Chamber, none of the parties having objected to this relinquishment.

<<90.29;97.05;en>>
The Moldovan government are represented by their agent, Mr. Lilian Apostol, assisted by Ms. Iulia Gheroghieș

<<97.05;99.65;en>>
and by Mr. Ruslan Cașu, advisors.

<<99.65;107.09;en>>
The Russian government are represented by their agent, Mr. Georgy Matyushkin, assisted by Mr. Nikolay Mikhaylov,

<<107.09;112.09;en>>

<<156.61;157.45;en>>
I call Mr. Apostol.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<164.0;167.59;en>>
Mr. President, Honorable Judge of the Grand Chamber,

<<167.59;177.56;en>>
Your Excellency, the representative of the Government of Russian Federation, the Federal Representative of the Applicants, distinguished audience.

<<177.56;183.39;en>>
May it please the Court, I plead on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Moldova.

<<183.39;193.23;en>>
This is already the third case before the Grand Chamber, implying similar question of jurisdiction and the responsibility of both respondent states.

<<193.23;205.56;en>>
It raises again the question of human rights violations coming from Transnistria, a breakaway region within the territory of Republic of Moldova with its own de facto local administration.

<<205.56;220.23;en>>
I recall that after the military conflict, a number of private persons claiming their affiliation for the Russian Federation and a position to the Republic of Moldova have declared the region as a new state entity.

<<220.23;230.03;en>>
Since then, no international recognition has been given to that region and to the local administration therein.

<<230.03;235.27;en>>
And my authorities have no effective control over that region yet.

<<235.27;251.83;en>>
In other words, I reiterate the situation amounted in the continuing frozen conflict, which resulted into the mode of 20 years of self-separation that became a black hole within the Espace Juridique de la Convention.

<<251.83;254.47;en>>
So why the third case before the Grand Chamber?

<<254.47;258.07;en>>
And what new questions it seeks to decide?

<<258.07;269.63;en>>
Allow me briefly to recall the very issue of the case and the most relevant facts for a better understanding of the questions of law that we are dealing with.

<<269.63;279.95;en>>
The applicant was accused and prosecuted by the so-called Transnistrian authorities according to the so-called criminal legislation of that region.

<<279.95;288.48;en>>
He was detained and sentenced by the criminal tribunal unlawful within the meaning of national and international law.

<<288.48;302.12;en>>
His detention involved, to the consequential extent, other alleged violations, such as human conditional detention, lack of medical assistance, prohibition of private meetings, et cetera.

<<302.12;314.56;en>>
Although the present case still involves, as I said, the question of two jurisdictions, however, another different and important question came into the attention of the Grand Chamber.

<<314.56;332.31;en>>
This is the question of unlawfulness of the so-called tribunals acting in the region, specifically, to what extent those internationally unrecognized foundations could be or not considerate as such for the purposes of the Convention.

<<332.31;344.48;en>>
I will address these questions, and accordingly, I will set the position of my government in reply to the applicant's complaints, which is consistent with our written submissions.

<<344.48;346.88;en>>
First, the jurisdiction.

<<346.88;355.24;en>>
My government's position follows the well-established case law dealing with similar problems in that breakaway region.

<<355.24;363.39;en>>
I refer to the Ilashko and Kantan cases that clarified the extent of jurisdiction in respect of both states.

<<363.39;366.15;en>>
I would briefly recall as follows.

<<366.15;373.27;en>>
The Republic of Moldova has its territorial jurisdiction over the region, but it has no effective control over it.

<<373.27;393.95;en>>
However, my government is still charged with positive obligation to do whatever possible for addressing each individual situation of a person claiming violation of the Convention rights and to pursue general measures for taking peacefully its effective control back.

<<393.95;405.24;en>>
This lack of effective control and the extent of its positive obligation disclose the degree of the responsibility of the Republic of Moldova.

<<405.24;422.67;en>>
The Russian Federation, on the other hand, retains its jurisdictional link by virtue of its continued military presence, economic and political support for that breakaway region, which could not otherwise survive.

<<422.67;439.48;en>>
Therefore, the Russian Federation bears the responsibility for the whole range of the Convention violation occurring in that region on account of its overall control exerted upon the de facto administration therein.

<<439.48;449.91;en>>
Accordingly, the court has already held that both respondent states retain their jurisdiction, though in different meaning and in different quality.

<<449.91;455.63;en>>
And I don't see any reason to hold otherwise in the present case.

<<455.63;472.44;en>>
However, as far as the jurisdiction is not equal to the meaning of international responsibility for a wrongful act, I will further elaborate on other issues relevant for the jurisdiction in the present case.

<<472.44;488.51;en>>
The Khatun case and thereafter other two cases before the Grand Chamber, Hassan and Jalot developed the jurisdiction question from a different angle, setting up the test of attribution or imputability.

<<488.51;505.43;en>>
I quote, the test for establishing the existence of jurisdiction has never been equated with the test for establishing the state responsibility for an internationally wrongful act under general international law.

<<505.43;511.15;en>>
This means that lack of any form of jurisdiction engage no responsibility.

<<511.15;523.71;en>>
While in cases where there is a jurisdictional link, the question of state responsibility becomes a separate issue examined in each individual case.

<<523.71;539.39;en>>
This international responsibility also depends on the form of jurisdiction, be that extraterritorial, personal, overall, direct, or implicit control over the local de facto administration assuming certain public powers.

<<539.39;551.36;en>>
Here, the court underlines the duty of the state with jurisdictional capacity to fulfill its positive obligations, regardless of the shape of its jurisdiction.

<<551.36;553.48;en>>
What concerns the Republic of Moldova?

<<553.48;559.2;en>>
The government agrees with its territorial jurisdiction, but without effective control.

<<559.2;567.88;en>>
And still, its positive obligations have been discharged in the present case, as it was in Ivancok and in Katan cases.

<<567.88;580.36;en>>
The facts of the case reveal that only my authorities, by all available means, have reacted to and assisted the applicant in pursuing the redress of his rights.

<<580.36;591.36;en>>
Our Supreme Court acknowledged the violation of his rights, and the prosecution initiated the criminal investigation into the events, which is pending.

<<591.36;595.08;en>>
Other measures are described in our written submissions.

<<595.08;606.79;en>>
I add that the Republic of Moldova has fulfilled its positive obligations to the extent where they clash with the overall control and powers of the Russian government.

<<606.79;610.31;en>>
So this is finally the clash between two jurisdictions.

<<610.31;630.59;en>>
Where the Republic of Moldova territorial jurisdictions, and lack of any effective control, eventually encounter the Russian Federation denial of its responsibility and its positive obligation for overall control exerted upon the de facto local administration.

<<630.59;642.91;en>>
In this sense, all positive obligations, be that Moldova's or Russia's, must be assessed proportionally to the level of control, in fact exercised by the both governments.

<<642.91;651.0;en>>
On the other hand, the clash of jurisdiction could be solved by discontinuing the Russian overall control.

<<651.0;661.15;en>>
Thus, the Russian government's positive obligation presupposes not a just passive inaction, but rather an active abstention.

<<661.15;688.36;en>>
Concluding on jurisdiction, I would like to refer to Monsieur René Casson, the very first president of the present court, who said in his Nobel Prize speech in 1968, I quote, there is no doubt concerning the essential question whether the nation have retained or lost their traditional exclusive jurisdiction over the treatment of their citizens.

<<688.36;692.12;en>>
That national jurisdiction will be always at the base.

<<692.12;698.2;en>>
It will remain primary, but it will no longer be exclusive.

<<698.2;705.27;en>>
The reasons behind these words is the shared responsibility engaged by the convention.

<<705.27;715.96;en>>
When it comes to the question of state responsibility in human rights, this jurisdiction fails to be exclusive defense, and it cannot cover the violations.

<<715.96;729.12;en>>
In the present case, and in all similar cases, the jurisdiction and the responsibility cannot be the matter of concern only for the Republic of Moldova as an expression of its territorial jurisdiction and positive obligations.

<<729.12;746.96;en>>
There can be and should be an active abstention from outside overall control, allowing the Republic of Moldova to put in practice its internationally recognized right to control its own territory and to establish therein its own legal order.

<<746.96;760.33;en>>
Speaking about legal order, I turn myself to the second fundamental question raised before the Grand Chamber, in particular about the unlawfulness of the self-created tribunals within the Transnistrian region.

<<760.33;767.19;en>>
The rest of the complaints of the applicants will become clearer once this fundamental question will be solved.

<<767.19;779.51;en>>
I also refer to all conclusions and written submissions that represent the valid position of my government before the present Grand Chamber on account of all applicants' complaints.

<<779.51;794.72;en>>
First of all, my government cannot plead against the applicants' complaint about their unlawfulness because my government cannot suggest even the slightest possibility to consider legitimate the Transnistrian tribunals.

<<794.72;800.67;en>>
Indeed, any judicial formation established in that region is unlawful.

<<800.67;808.47;en>>
These were the findings of the Moldovan Supreme Court that annulled the applicant's sentence on this very ground.

<<808.47;825.43;en>>
I recall that the Supreme Court followed the reason of the present court from the Ilashko case and agreed that any so-called tribunal set up in the Transnistrian region is outside of the Moldovan constitution, national and international law, as well as the convention.

<<825.43;834.95;en>>
Given this, any Transnistrian tribunal cannot deliver lawful judgments or order lawful detentions.

<<834.95;838.61;en>>
It lacks national and international validity.

<<838.61;852.71;en>>
Furthermore, the government must add that the Transnistrian tribunals, being outside of the national and international law, could not be regarded as means of exertions and could not guarantee fair trials.

<<852.71;862.35;en>>
In view of that, there has been a violation on this account, but my government does not bear the responsibility for that unlawfulness.

<<862.36;869.88;en>>
My government does not contribute nor does it tolerate the maintenance of such an unlawfulness.

<<869.88;883.51;en>>
The Republic of Moldova has never recognized, neither internationally nor internationally, the legitimacy of Transnistrian tribunals and the so-called de facto authorities from the region.

<<883.51;890.59;en>>
This is also true for the Russian government, which also has never recognized the self-declared Transnistrian state.

<<890.59;900.43;en>>
Therefore, this non-recognition encompasses the rebuttal of any legitimacy of the de facto courts and other public bodies within the region.

<<900.43;908.47;en>>
Therefore, in the opinion of all parties to the present litigation, the response to the second question is clear.

<<908.47;919.75;en>>
The so-called courts in the Transnistrian region are unlawful and could neither be exhausted nor considered legitimate for the purposes of the convention.

<<919.75;940.39;en>>
However, the parties were also called before the Grand Chamber to elaborate on the compatibility of this situation with its previous case law, in particular with Fokap and Protopapa cases, and to express views whether the so-called Namibia exception is applicable to the present case.

<<940.39;947.03;en>>
Here, I begin with the fundamental principle of international law called the non-recognition.

<<947.03;954.48;en>>
It declares that illegal acts cannot become sources of legally valid results.

<<954.48;962.41;en>>
Its function is to prevent validation of any act or its consequences, which are already legally void.

<<962.41;983.91;en>>
In other words, applying this principle to the present case, the acts of the Transnistrian tribunals are contrary to international law and shall not become sources of legal rights for them because their judgments are the poisoned fruits of illegal conduct.

<<983.91;994.72;en>>
Moreover, this non-recognition on account of unlawfulness is to be extended to the whole institutional foundation of the Transnistrian region.

<<994.72;1011.48;en>>
The doctrine defines a non-recognition as the state obligation not to recognize through individual or collective acts the alleged statehood of an effective territorial entity created in violation of one of or more fundamental rules of international law.

<<1011.48;1030.32;en>>
In the present context, it is particularly important that this obligation is not restricted in its application only to the states, since international organizations, including the Council of Europe and the European Court, bear the same responsibility under international law.

<<1030.32;1035.19;en>>
I would also recall the distinctive feature of any de facto administration.

<<1035.19;1040.95;en>>
It remains to be exercised of effective authority over territory and people living there.

<<1040.95;1053.12;en>>
Once the regime is not recognized by international community, it's exercised its authority only de facto, which signifies its illegal or extra legal foundation.

<<1053.12;1064.19;en>>
In order to validate their existence, the de facto administration seeks recognition from bigger powers to give weight to their international status and claims.

<<1064.19;1068.95;en>>
So in this situation, another descending principle may come into play.

<<1068.95;1078.6;en>>
It says that effective practice in certain circumstances generate legal consequences mostly through international human rights law.

<<1078.6;1086.95;en>>
This approach opposes to the general rule of non-recognition, and it may be considered an exception to that rule.

<<1086.95;1101.47;en>>
Another aspect in the relation of these two apparently descending principles is that the consequence of violation of the peremptory norm is legal nulity, which operates erga omnis.

<<1101.47;1113.56;en>>
Thus, the duty of non-recognition arises when there is a view that the serious violation of the peremptory norm of international law was committed.

<<1113.56;1140.39;en>>
Both the draft articles on state responsibility of international law commission and the case law of International Court of Justice stipulate that the duty not to recognize legality of a situation created in violation of a peremptory norm of international law extends not only to the formal acts of recognition, but also to those acts, omissions that would imply such recognition.

<<1140.39;1151.19;en>>
In the present case, the unlawfulness of the de facto tribunals represents the essence of the applicant complaint, and it stands at the core of the alleged violation of the convention.

<<1151.19;1156.67;en>>
The complaint is not examined via exhaustion rule or the right to remedy.

<<1156.67;1166.45;en>>
Here, the right to a lawful tribunal is a critical guarantee of Article 5 and 6 and the cornerstone of the entire convention.

<<1166.45;1175.48;en>>
To hold that the unrecognized tribunal might have been lawful is to undermine the very essence and the meaning of that right.

<<1175.48;1185.56;en>>
Therefore, I must say that there is there unlawfulness of the tribunal is a peremptory norm of international law.

<<1185.56;1189.91;en>>
Its breach cannot be overruled ever.

<<1189.91;1201.91;en>>
Turning to our case, I recall the court in Ilashku did not acknowledge the lawfulness of the tribunals in their region and found them to be contrary to the convention.

<<1201.91;1220.03;en>>
Now the question whether the situation, at least after the Ilashku case has been changed, and whether the Namibia exception, which has been successfully applied in Fokha-Protopapa and Cyprus versus Turkey case, as well as in Dimopoulos case, could be exceptionally applied to the Transnistrian cases.

<<1220.03;1225.12;en>>
My government's position to that, it could not and should not be applied.

<<1225.12;1232.76;en>>
Therefore, the very principle of nonrecognition should prevail in the present case for the following reasons.

<<1232.76;1239.91;en>>
The court has never regarded the law enacted by recognized entities as law within the meaning of the convention.

<<1239.91;1261.23;en>>
For example, I refer to the landmark cases, the Lusidu followed by Cyprus versus Turkey, where the court held that the de facto entity was not a state recognized under international law and consequently the expropriation clause in the so-called constitution and any law based on it did not have any validity.

<<1261.23;1268.91;en>>
In its last admissibility decision in case of Kiryagov and others versus Armenia, the court confirmed this approach.

<<1268.91;1275.99;en>>
Similar reasons should be applied to all laws enacted by the de facto administration in the Transnistrian region.

<<1275.99;1282.55;en>>
Also, the court does not select laws it could accept for the purposes of the convention.

<<1282.55;1292.83;en>>
This is because in this situation, the court basically looks who enacted these laws and not what laws regulate.

<<1292.83;1301.95;en>>
As a result, this also means that such a law emanated from an unrecognized entity cannot establish a lawful tribunal either.

<<1301.95;1317.23;en>>
Otherwise, if the court would consider the Transnistrian tribunals as lawful for the purposes of the convention, it may lay a recognition to certain powers of internationally recognized entities to enact internationally recognizable and valid laws.

<<1317.23;1326.47;en>>
This would be inconsistent with its own case law where the court does not recognize any laws enacted by unrecognized entities.

<<1326.47;1341.99;en>>
However, in Cyprus and versus Turkey, and consequently in Fokha and Protopapa, revealed that the court has regarded the judicial system of an internationally recognized entity as a tool to be exhausted.

<<1341.99;1348.31;en>>
Therefore, a certain legitimacy for the purposes of the convention was given to the de facto judicial system.

<<1348.31;1350.83;en>>
The Dimopoulos case confirmed this approach.

<<1350.83;1355.11;en>>
Why the court review its own non-recognition obligation?

<<1355.11;1360.88;en>>
First reason is that it was made in exceptional circumstances and narrowly applied.

<<1360.88;1369.95;en>>
And the second reason is that the court extended the application of the so-called Namibia exception in those exceptional cases.

<<1369.95;1373.23;en>>
Henceforth, I will be dealing with these two aspects.

<<1373.23;1383.67;en>>
Does the Transnistrian breakaway region call for the similar and exceptional approach as it was made in regard to the northern Cyprus territory?

<<1383.67;1388.71;en>>
And whether the Namibia exception is in general applicable to the Transnistrian region?

<<1388.71;1396.95;en>>
Any exception from the rule, in our case, the rule of non-recognition, is for the strictest application and narrow interpretation.

<<1396.95;1417.07;en>>
Therefore, what worked in Cyprus versus Turkey will not necessarily be the same in the Transnistrian situation, especially when there is a certain fundamental, contextual, and factual differences which do not allow for a blind application of the Namibia exception in the Transnistrian cases.

<<1417.07;1434.15;en>>
First, in the Cyprus of Fokon Protopapa and all other similar cases, while assessing the laws enforced within the territory of northern Cyprus, the courts take into account the international recognition by the Turkey of the legitimacy of the de facto entity.

<<1434.15;1443.13;en>>
This international recognition established both jurisdictional link and also the connection between both legal system of Turkey and the de facto entity.

<<1443.13;1453.23;en>>
Especially this was true when the Turkey claimed the exhaustion of the de facto judicial system and therefore the validity of northern Cyprus courts.

<<1453.23;1460.75;en>>
In the present case, no state has ever recognized the international legitimacy of the de facto Transnistrian authorities.

<<1460.75;1466.51;en>>
No state has ever acknowledged, even implicitly, the validity of its courts.

<<1466.51;1470.47;en>>
And they has never been indicated as means for exhaustion.

<<1470.47;1481.15;en>>
Therefore, it could not be regarded as being part of any legal system of internationally recognized state and thus lawful for the purposes of the convention.

<<1481.15;1490.36;en>>
The lack of any international recognition is essential for the application of non-recognition rule and for the excluding of Namibia exception.

<<1490.36;1497.39;en>>
Second, what the Namibia exception is about and what are the risks for the present case?

<<1497.39;1514.43;en>>
It goes to balance out two seemingly contradictory principle, the non-recognition of unlawful acts and the factual existence of certain acts, unlawful but effective in terms only in human rights law.

<<1514.43;1529.88;en>>
That the doctrine follows this approach based on the theory of necessity upon which the consequences of acts of the de facto regimes can be given some effect when doing otherwise would run contrary to peace and good order.

<<1529.88;1537.91;en>>
This means that the Namibia exception is meant to calm down the things and not to worsen them.

<<1537.91;1544.95;en>>
From this angle, it is not applicable to the present case because here it will run against its scope.

<<1544.95;1553.15;en>>
In our situation, the recognition of unlawful tribunal would be contrary to the fragile arrangements made for the peace in the region.

<<1553.15;1560.99;en>>
It will not solve the already existing gap in the national legal system, but it will deepen the differences.

<<1560.99;1571.04;en>>
Moreover, the exception cannot give a legitimacy to the judiciary that operates contrary to the convention principles, which is against peace and order.

<<1571.04;1580.36;en>>
And eventually, this exception in the Transnistrian file will subdue the already delicate and problematic negotiations.

<<1580.36;1583.32;en>>
Another important aspect should be kept in mind.

<<1583.32;1590.36;en>>
The Namibia exception is narrow, and it is applicable only in relation of certain qualified acts.

<<1590.36;1606.32;en>>
For example, the Judge DiCastro in his descending opinion on the advisory opinion of Namibia suggested that for assessing whether a particular act should be granted legal validity, distinction should be made between public and private acts.

<<1606.32;1616.56;en>>
In other words, that acts which are aimed at or capable of embedding any legal regime cannot be granted legal validity.

<<1616.56;1632.0;en>>
In this sense, the criminal courts were always considered as a resemblance of public powers, and the recognition of their legitimacy would be tantamount to the granting legal validity to the whole unlawful regime.

<<1632.0;1636.88;en>>
The Namibia exception relates to everyday relation and private acts.

<<1636.88;1643.32;en>>
Such acts can be valid irrespective of their recognition as lawful or unlawful.

<<1643.32;1657.43;en>>
On the other hand, the criminal law acts and the criminal law proceedings are part of the public law, and their recognition as lawful is prerequisite to be considered as such.

<<1657.43;1663.35;en>>
There are not everyday and private relations.

<<1663.35;1668.55;en>>
Hence, the Namibia exception could not be extended for this reason either.

<<1668.55;1678.39;en>>
There are other reasons why the Namibia exception is not applicable to the Transnistrian cases, which are comprehensively elaborated in our written submission.

<<1678.39;1701.91;en>>
My government does not endorse the application of Cyprus and then the Fokha and Protopapa principles to the present case and to all Transnistrian cases because of fundamental differences between the general context, legal backgrounds, and the reasons behind the court's assessment of the de facto regimes in northern Cyprus and in the Transnistrian region.

<<1701.91;1720.19;en>>
The Transnistrian de facto authorities, their courts, and all institutions are unlawful because they do not belong to a system functioning on constitution and legal basis reflecting at least a judicial tradition compatible with the convention.

<<1720.19;1729.03;en>>
There is a need to apply different international standards for a successive resolution of the present black hole illegacy.

<<1729.03;1742.12;en>>
This requires an assessment of either of both governments' positive obligation and avoiding the clash of jurisdiction, one territorial but without effective control and other extraterritorial overall jurisdiction.

<<1742.12;1756.52;en>>
These jurisdictions clash cannot be solved by extensive application of the Namibia exception, which at last would lead to the territorial disintegration of the Republic of Moldova and to the gap between the legal systems.

<<1756.52;1767.43;en>>
This clash and the gap could be solved only by discontinuing the Russian government's overall control in favor of the Republic of Moldova territorial jurisdiction.

<<1767.43;1780.03;en>>
In that situation, the Republic of Moldova, as an expression of its very territorial right, would be able to put in place the rule of law and democracy principles in the region.

<<1780.03;1789.15;en>>
I finish by quoting that the scale of justice may tip one way and another, but ultimately they balance out.

<<1789.15;1802.71;en>>
The court may take its proactive approach as an expression of its highest judicial function and to show the parties what is wrong and what is right and how to deal with it.

<<1802.71;1813.91;en>>
In any case, we may argue about lawfulness or unlawfulness of an act, but we may not transform it into something which it is not.

<<1813.91;1814.83;en>>
Thank you for attention.

<<1814.83;1814.87;en>>

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<1818.39;1820.55;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Apostol.

<<1820.55;1821.55;en>>
I call now Mr. Matyushkin.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<1831.09;1836.05;en>>
Mr. President, honorable judges, excellencies,

<<1836.05;1851.93;en>>
the present case gives an opportunity to examine once again the issue of crucial importance concerning the extent of states' obligations and limits of their responsibility in the context of international relationships.

<<1851.93;1857.09;en>>
It is the issue of the state's territorial jurisdiction of which I speak.

<<1857.09;1863.85;en>>
As it was stated by the court on numerous occasions, the convention is a living instrument.

<<1863.85;1874.17;en>>
I therefore believe that the court should not overlook this precedential provision and should not formally repeat its previous findings in the case of Qatan.

<<1874.17;1897.53;en>>
But instead, it should take this opportunity to thoroughly analyze its position and to freshly examine this sensitive issue so as to contribute to the peaceful cooperation of the member states and not to increase the controversies between them, but to find a balanced approach which will correspond to the objective picture of the international relations.

<<1897.53;1909.21;en>>
The present case concerns a wide range of the violations of the applicant's rights that allegedly took place during his trial and detention in Transnistria.

<<1909.21;1930.77;en>>
However, the basic issue of this case, similar to the other so-called Transnistrian case, is whether these alleged violations fall within the jurisdiction of the Russian government or the government of Republic of Moldova and also under the jurisdiction of the court.

<<1930.77;1944.21;en>>
As it was recalled by the court in Qatan, the existence of the effective control of the state over an area outside its territory is a question of fact.

<<1944.21;1947.93;en>>
That was in Para 107.

<<1947.93;1964.29;en>>
Establishing the Russian Federation effective control over Transnistria in the indicated case, the court was based on its initial finding in the case of Ilashko, which covered the period up to 2004.

<<1964.29;1971.73;en>>
In particular, the court took into account the presence of the Russian military servicemen in the region.

<<1971.73;1981.01;en>>
There are allegedly three supplies of gas and the humanitarian aid provided to the inhabitants of the Transnistria region.

<<1981.01;1997.85;en>>
However, as the court pointed out in Bankovic and others, cases concerning extraterritorial jurisdiction are exceptional and require special justification in the particular circumstances of each case.

<<1997.85;2015.97;en>>
Therefore, it would be unjustified to automatically apply the findings made in Ilashko and Qatan to the present case, because at the very least, the events in question took place four years after the events described in Qatan case.

<<2015.97;2045.65;en>>
These factors, presence of the military servicemen, humanitarian aid, and economic support, take cumulatively in the court's view, speak in favor of the Russian control over the region, which in its turn, following the approach taken by the court, inevitably entails the responsibility of the Russian Federation for any alleged violation of the convention occurring in Transnistria.

<<2045.65;2069.77;en>>
The Russian government believes that this position is neither based on the case law of the court, nor on the case law of any other international judicial bodies, and what is more important, it is vulnerable from the standpoint of logic, in particular, in respect of the establishment of the presence of necessary causal links.

<<2069.77;2088.65;en>>
The problem is that the approach taken by the court in Ilashko and Qatan, and the conclusions to which it came, were based on the incorrect assumptions as regard the Russian role and the extent of its influence on the local authorities of Transnistria.

<<2088.65;2103.37;en>>
As a result, the recent judgments in the Transnistrian cases, which were supposedly aimed at the improvement of human rights situation in the region, in fact, have left into a dead end.

<<2103.37;2119.21;en>>
First of all, on the basis of the above said arguments, we believe that the scope of the course examination in the present case should be limited by the factual circumstances relating to the period of the occurrence of the alleged violation.

<<2119.21;2138.65;en>>
It cannot be overlooked that more than 16 years passed since the active stage of Transnistrian conflict until the alleged violations of the applicant's rights and the situation in the region has dramatically changed.

<<2138.65;2152.21;en>>
Therefore, attaching any significance to the long gone events without due regard to the present situation leads to the arbitrary and retrospective application of the convention.

<<2152.21;2162.89;en>>
In 1991, both of the acting parties of the conflict had neither any reasonable grounds to coordinate their conduct with the convention.

<<2162.89;2168.89;en>>
And moreover, nor could this foresee further evolution of the court's case law.

<<2168.89;2200.29;en>>
Accordingly, the scope of the course examination should be limited only to the question whether in the period complained by the applicant, Transnistria was under control of the Russian Federation without references to the events of 1991, 1992, yes, and Russian role in them as it was made in Khatyn case.

<<2200.29;2224.89;en>>
Secondly, at the court underlined, in particular in Alskanian Others versus United Kingdom and Gelude versus Netherlands, the strength of the state's military presence is of particular importance for determining whether it exercises the effective control over any region outside its own territory.

<<2224.89;2239.33;en>>
In this regard, the government emphasized that there are slightly over 1,200 Russian military servicemen deployed in Transnistria as peacekeeping forces.

<<2239.33;2255.93;en>>
400 of them act under the command of the Joint Control Commission, a trilateral organization comprising of the representatives of Moldova, Ukraine, and the Russian Federation.

<<2255.93;2274.41;en>>
The GCC exercise full control over these forces by determining their deployment sites of their peacekeepers, their required number, and assigning them with certain tasks within the general objective of peace maintaining in the region.

<<2274.41;2285.97;en>>
It also investigates their violations of the ceasefire regime and takes certain measures to prevent their violations and to reestablish peace.

<<2285.97;2300.73;en>>
Accordingly, the Russian military servicemen acting under the control of the GCC should not be taken into account while assessing the overall number of troops deployed in the region.

<<2300.73;2308.99;en>>
More significant weight should be attached to the circumstance than it was made in the previous Transnistrian cases.

<<2308.99;2328.51;en>>
The rest of the servicemen are engaged in guiding the arms of the former 14th Soviet Army in Kalbasnya, where 2,000 tons of armament are kept, 57% of which are out of date.

<<2328.51;2338.21;en>>
Approximately the same quantity of armaments was already moved by the Russian Federation between 2000 and 2004.

<<2338.21;2355.61;en>>
Although the completion or the withdrawal of armaments does not solely depend on the Russian government, since the railway and the air transport cannot be used in the absence of mutual agreements between Moldovan government and Transnistrian local authorities.

<<2355.61;2369.67;en>>
Thus, the railroad, in fact, remains blocked, and the Cheryaspel Airport cannot be used due to the difficulties in performing custom and border control there by government of Moldova.

<<2369.67;2376.81;en>>
Therefore, the presence of the Russian military servicemen in the region is limited both locally and functionally.

<<2376.81;2386.25;en>>
Moreover, the significant number of the Russian troops is controlled by the independently functioning interstate peacekeeping organization.

<<2386.25;2396.33;en>>
Anyway, it is obvious that such a small number of military servicemen could not be regarded as a significant military force within the region.

<<2396.33;2404.05;en>>
And the court itself agreed with it in Khatyn case in Parag 118.

<<2404.05;2424.89;en>>
And it is certainly inadequate for establishing effective control over it compared to the 30,000 military personnel stationed in northern Cyprus, which allowed the court to establish the effective control of Turkey or the territory in the case of Lusitania.

<<2424.89;2441.45;en>>
It is of vital importance that the servicemen act in strict compliance with the purposes of peacekeeping, but not as supporters of the Transnistrian authorities, as it was unfoundedly presented in the court's judgment.

<<2441.45;2446.65;en>>
And no evidence to the contrary have been presented so far.

<<2446.65;2454.61;en>>
What is more important, their withdrawal will not automatically lead to the vanishing of the Transnistrian authorities.

<<2454.61;2465.51;en>>
But at the same time, their absence from the region will leave the arms store in Kolbatsnya unsecured, thus jeopardizing the peace in the region.

<<2465.51;2481.69;en>>
It is our responsibility as a mediator in the peaceful settlement of the Transnistrian conflict to prevent the re-emergence of the violent armed clashes, which may affect their tranquility in Europe.

<<2481.69;2489.61;en>>
However, it does not mean that the Russian government bears responsibility for any actions of local authorities.

<<2489.61;2495.05;en>>
As regards their politic and economic support, their following should be stated.

<<2495.05;2516.77;en>>
Firstly, according to the court's logic expressed in para 107 of the judgment in Khatun, their political and economic support serve only as secondary criteria of effective control, whereas the strength of their military presence is considered to be their primary one.

<<2516.77;2526.09;en>>
Consequently, they do not have any independent significance in the absence of the military dominance of the state or the foreign territory.

<<2526.09;2543.89;en>>
Secondly, the Russian government expressed a utter disappointment with the court's interpretation of the alleged discounts for gas and humanitarian aid provided to the Russian citizens living in Transnistria as criteria of the effective control.

<<2543.89;2552.45;en>>
It should be taken into account that Russian natural resources, such as gas and oil, are actively consumed around the world.

<<2552.45;2562.37;en>>
And the large number of countries are more or less depends on their Russian supplies and are indebted to the Russian Federation.

<<2562.37;2572.37;en>>
Their continuing supplies of resources to our debtors do not automatically testify to the existence of our control over these countries.

<<2572.37;2585.71;en>>
Moreover, it should be noted that the gas is supplied to Moldova as a whole, including Transnistria, under the contract between Russian company Gazprom and the Moldova gas company.

<<2585.71;2592.09;en>>
There is no legal basis for any privileges or discriminate prices for any regions of Moldova.

<<2592.09;2602.73;en>>
And the debt for the gas consumed by Transnistria and other regions of Moldova is attributed to Moldova in full amount by the contract.

<<2602.73;2614.99;en>>
We emphasize that there is no some secret pipe through which the gas is delivered directly to Transnistria by passing Moldova.

<<2614.99;2632.05;en>>
Furthermore, we believe that neither does the so-called humanitarian aid, which in fact consists of pensions and social allowances to the local residents, speaks of the existence of any control over Transnistria.

<<2632.05;2652.41;en>>
It is obvious that such pensions and allowances are provided to the residents of Transnistria for their survival because their well-being by no means must depend on their political situation in the region or debatable decisions of the international judicial bodies.

<<2652.41;2665.77;en>>
We owe to and we will provide social support to our citizens regardless of the country they stay, and it will not constitute interference in the internal affairs of the foreign state.

<<2665.77;2670.85;en>>
Moreover, it does not speak of the establishment of effective control over the foreign territory.

<<2675.97;2689.81;en>>
It is authority selected by the resident population who exercise the effective control over its territory and the inhabitants irrespective of their provisions or provision by Russian of humanitarian aid.

<<2689.81;2705.97;en>>
Besides, provided by the Russian Federation, economic support is in no way sufficient to ensure the survival of local authorities as it was claimed by the court in its previous judgment in Transnistria case.

<<2705.97;2716.97;en>>
For example, we provide for this social support about one billion ruble per year.

<<2716.97;2748.13;en>>
If we will divide this sum for population of Transnistria, which now is a little bit more than half a million people, it will mean that one person get annually about 2,000 rubles, which by modern rate is something like 30 euros per year.

<<2748.13;2752.13;en>>
Only 30 euros per year for each person annually.

<<2755.93;2758.17;en>>
That's the sum.

<<2761.57;2775.55;en>>
As regards the alleged political support, it should be noted that the Russian government consequently adhere to the principle of the territorial integrity of the state and consider Transnistria as an integral part of Moldova.

<<2775.55;2787.61;en>>
In its contacts with the Republic of Moldova and the authorities of Transnistria, the Russian Federation follow the basic documents related to the Transnistrian conflict.

<<2787.61;2799.25;en>>
In particular, the memorandum on the basis for the settlement and the normalization of relations between the Republic of Moldova and Transnistria of 1997.

<<2799.25;2815.73;en>>
According to this memo, the government of Moldova practically delegated a certain amount of powers, namely to establish and maintain foreign contacts in the economic, scientific, technical, and cultural areas to the Transnistrian authorities.

<<2815.73;2822.73;en>>
And it is precisely in these areas that the Russian Federation cooperates with the region now.

<<2822.73;2834.13;en>>
In any way, the political aspect is quite an elusive indicator to attribute any significance to it in the context of the exterritorial jurisdiction.

<<2834.13;2863.05;en>>
We strongly object to the arbitrary assessment of the Russian politics by the court as an additional marker of the effective control of the Russian Federation over Transnistria, especially taking into account the absence of any examples of deviation of the Russian government from the general line of its relations with the Republic of Moldova as a sovereign and indivisible state.

<<2863.05;2884.17;en>>
We believe that the political matters should be left to the political powers, and the court should distance itself from any active involvement in the political process, and definitely it should not substitute the existing European bodies, in particular, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

<<2884.17;2904.63;en>>
The court's task is to deal with the certain violations of the Convention, but not to interfere with the international relations by the arbitrary extension of the effect of the Convention beyond their limits, which could not have been predicted by the contracting parties upon its certification.

<<2904.63;2929.49;en>>
It is beyond dispute that the resolution of the Transnistrian issue itself does not fall within the competence of the court, and it would be groundless, gross misinterpretation of our role of a mediator in the complicated relations between Chisinau and Tiraspol as the one hindering the settlement of the conflict.

<<2929.49;2958.61;en>>
Moving further to the legal aspect of the case, the Russian government once again emphasized that the concept of the effective control elaborated by the court, through which the notion of jurisdiction is interpreted and applied, serves with boundaries of the Convention operation and should be put aside in favor of more clear and consistent approaches corresponding to the bulk of the international law on the issue.

<<2958.61;2971.89;en>>
The concept of jurisdiction itself implies that the state could adopt mandatory regulation, adjudicate emerging disputes, and willfully inform their regulations adopted.

<<2971.89;2997.89;en>>
In the aspect of human rights law, that means that the violation could be regarded imputable to the state only when it has a real opportunity to commit and to obtain from committing a violation of one's rights, to prevent such violations, to investigate them, to hold the actual perpetrators responsible, and to compensate to the victims.

<<2997.89;3004.09;en>>
It is quite obvious that the Russian government exercise no of these functions in Transnistria.

<<3004.09;3031.09;en>>
Having regarded the exercise of effective control over the territory as one of the exceptional circumstances that is capable of giving rise to the jurisdiction of a contracting state outside its own territorial borders, the court has failed firstly to determine the exact meaning of the term effective control, and secondly, to clarify the scope of its components and their significance.

<<3031.09;3039.33;en>>
In some cases, the court applies the collocation and effective control or an effective authority.

<<3039.33;3048.61;en>>
In others, an overall control, and sometimes using the mixture of both calling it an effective overall control.

<<3048.61;3055.69;en>>
The components of the effective control are vague and vary from judgment to judgment.

<<3055.69;3075.25;en>>
Depending on the approach chosen by the court, the term control can include such components as decisive influence, as in Ilashko, and the close relationship by virtue of military, economic, financial, political support, as in Ivansok and others.

<<3075.25;3084.97;en>>
The court's failure to provide clear answers to these issues makes its case law unfeasible and undermines the court's credibility.

<<3084.97;3090.13;en>>
Judgments in the Transnistrian cases have further complicated the issue.

<<3090.13;3095.81;en>>
The notions of effective and overall control were not invented by the court.

<<3095.81;3108.69;en>>
The relevant jurisdictional tests were first formulated by the International Court of Justice and its decisions, and further elaborated by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

<<3108.69;3129.81;en>>
Still, for some unknown reason, the court departs from the existing system of international case law, stating that the test for establishing the existence of jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention differs from the test of establishing a state's responsibility for an internationally wrongful act under international law.

<<3129.81;3133.57;en>>
This is part 115 of Katan case.

<<3133.57;3156.09;en>>
From our point of view, by such judgments, the court worsens the conflict of case law of different international judicial bodies, thus contributing to the fragmentation of international law and opposes its case law to that of the International Court of Justice, one of the main bodies of the United Nations.

<<3156.09;3161.37;en>>
In other words, the united system of international law should not be undermined.

<<3161.37;3172.93;en>>
It should not be burdened by the coexisting conflicting approaches to the same issues, especially to such sensitive one as extraterritorial jurisdiction.

<<3172.93;3198.89;en>>
The International Court of Justice, when deciding on the international responsibility of an outside power for the internationally wrongful conduct of secessionist entity, examines whether the authorities of the secessionist entity were controlled by the outside power when performing their wrongful conduct.

<<3198.89;3218.25;en>>
It is commonly known that the case of Nicaragua versus United States and Bosnian genocide case are the leading cases on the issue in which the International Court of Justice formulated two tests of control, that of strict control and the effective control.

<<3218.25;3224.29;en>>
The requirements of the strict control established by the International Court of Justice are the following.

<<3224.29;3229.69;en>>
Firstly, the secessionist entity must be completely dependent on the outside power.

<<3229.69;3237.13;en>>
Secondly, the complete dependence must extend to all fields of activity of the secessionist entity.

<<3237.13;3247.21;en>>
Thirdly, the outside power must actually have made use of their potential for control inherent in their complete dependence.

<<3247.21;3252.33;en>>
It must have actually exercised a particularly high degree of control.

<<3252.33;3263.25;en>>
The effective control test, in its turn, is applied in cases of partial dependence of a secessionist entity on the outside power.

<<3263.25;3279.69;en>>
However, this partial dependence established under the effective control test of the International Court of Justice still does not allow regarding this entity as a de facto organ of the outside power, which is depend on.

<<3279.69;3288.49;en>>
The responsibility of an outside power still has to be established for specific conduct of the secessionist entity in the certain case.

<<3288.49;3295.17;en>>
It is also worth mentioning that the control should not be confused with support.

<<3295.17;3314.11;en>>
Subsequently, the appeal chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Tadzic case applied the so-called overall control test, attributing the conduct of an organized group or entity to the outside power or the state.

<<3314.11;3328.93;en>>
From the standpoint of this test, the state's responsibility for actions of an organized entity to be established requires two points taken cumulatively.

<<3328.93;3340.45;en>>
The provision of financial and training assistance, military equipment, and operational support, participation in the organization, coordination, or planning of operations.

<<3340.45;3350.53;en>>
It is essential that the provision of economic, military, or other assistance in and of itself is not sufficient to establish overall control.

<<3350.53;3369.49;en>>
The tests of control of International Court of Justice and International Tribunal of former Yugoslavia differ in their strictness requiring various extent of participation of the outside power in the activity of the secessionist entity.

<<3369.49;3410.77;en>>
However, despite these differences, each of them correlate to the rules of customary international law, which are reflected in particular in Article 8 of the draft articles on state responsibility elaborated by the International Law Commission of the United Nations, according to which the conduct of a person or a group of persons shall be considered an act of a state under international law if they, in fact, acting on the instructions of or under the direction or control of that state in carrying out the conduct.

<<3410.77;3420.97;en>>
That means that both tests require participation of the outside power in the operations of the secessionist entity.

<<3420.97;3436.17;en>>
This requirement, however, is absent from the effective overall control test of the court, which abstractedness allows varying its elements depending on the approach chosen by the court.

<<3436.17;3448.93;en>>
The court went one step beyond in the case of Luisito, elaborating an even less stringent test than that of the ICTY.

<<3448.93;3450.01;en>>
Why?

<<3450.01;3468.01;en>>
According to the court's test of effective overall control subsequently applied in the Lashko and in Khatan cases, the state could be held generally responsible for any actions of a subordinate local administration.

<<3468.01;3486.37;en>>
Moreover, it seems that the court's finding as regard the existence of the effective control are based on a somewhat staircase scheme of criteria in which one elusive characteristic of control would be easily substituted by another.

<<3486.37;3496.73;en>>
Thus, the effective authority, which might not be the same as the effective control, could be replaced by decisive influence.

<<3496.73;3506.61;en>>
This term, which is exclusively an invention of the court and does not have analogs in the international law.

<<3506.61;3539.29;en>>
If none of them allow the court to came to the conclusion of the existence of the state jurisdiction at which it is already arrived earlier, the court simply refers to the manifestly erroneous presumption that the administration in any event survives by virtue of the military, economic, financial, and political support given to it by the outside power, thus coming to the stereotyped and ill-founded conclusion.

<<3539.29;3553.57;en>>
As regard this last criterion, it would be devoid of any logic to rely on the assumption that the secessionist entity survive by virtue of the military, economic, financial, and political support given to it.

<<3553.57;3556.17;en>>
This case, Ilashko, Para 392.

<<3556.17;3568.29;en>>
To impute the alleged violations to the Russian government in the present case, firstly, as it was shown above, no such support actually exists.

<<3568.29;3585.85;en>>
And secondly, the court obviously ignored the logical methods of the establishment of the causal links finding the provision by Russia of economic and humanitarian aid to the inhabitants as the main ground for human rights violations in Transnistria.

<<3585.85;3594.17;en>>
Thus, the court finds that the violation established inevitably constitute a consequence of the Russian support.

<<3594.17;3606.49;en>>
The court should provide firm evidence so as to prove that these circumstances inevitably precondition human rights violations and become the ground for their violation.

<<3606.49;3611.61;en>>
The gas prices could not affect the educational language in schools.

<<3611.61;3615.33;en>>
The armament store could not convict a person.

<<3615.33;3620.29;en>>
The amount of pensions could not affect the conditions of detention in Transnistria.

<<3620.29;3631.25;en>>
And peacekeepers hardly had any relation to the alleged fact that the applicant was not provided with the requisite medical assistance.

<<3631.25;3637.49;en>>
In other words, any legal construction should be based in the first place on the common sense.

<<3637.49;3645.85;en>>
The effective control in the view of the court means the obligation to ensure the whole range of the rights under the convention.

<<3645.85;3676.29;en>>
However, in this case, if one assess all circumstances straight and thoroughly, it is obvious that not only the insignificant number of Russian troops is arrested with no authority, but practically, it could not ensure the right to a fair trial or to a freedom of religion in such territory as Transnistria with its population of 500,000 people.

<<3676.29;3696.37;en>>
The initial finding of the court in the Lashko case as to the existence of the Russian Federation jurisdiction of the applicants should not be a frame of nature, allowing engagement of the responsibility of the Russian Federation for any violation occurring in the territory of Transnistria.

<<3696.37;3716.21;en>>
In Lashko, the government was held responsible not for the acts of ill treatment by the Transnistrian police itself, but because first, the acts committed by Russian agents, including the applicant's arrest, detention, and their transfer to Transnistrian police.

<<3716.21;3723.85;en>>
And they further inactively given a real opportunity to prevent or cease their violation.

<<3723.85;3737.89;en>>
Therefore, unlike in Khatam case, in the Lashko, the court did not deal with the question of attribution of the conduct of the Transnistrian authorities to the Russian Federation.

<<3737.89;3746.25;en>>
In this connection, any attempts to present Transnistrian cases as a sort of consistent case law would be artificial.

<<3746.25;3765.77;en>>
Given that the Russian government were neither involved in the alleged violations of the applicant's rights, nor have they been acknowledged under international law as an occupying power in Transnistria, we also believe that there is no presumption of our jurisdiction over the region.

<<3765.77;3777.37;en>>
Accordingly, the burden of proof as regards the absence of our control and of its causal link to the alleged violations should not be laid upon us.

<<3777.37;3791.25;en>>
Lastly, as regard the merits of the case in the absence of our direct or indirect involvement in the alleged violations of the applicant's rights, the government could not provide the court with any information in this regard.

<<3791.25;3803.43;en>>
Any attempts to this end would be speculative, and moreover, would inevitably constitute the interference in the sovereign international affairs of the Republic of Moldova.

<<3803.43;3803.43;en>>
Thank you for your attention.

<<3805.46;3811.14;en>>
Thank you very much Mr. Matyushkin. I call now Ms. Hriplivii.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<3815.53;3818.01;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<3818.01;3819.27;en>>
good morning.

<<3819.27;3826.65;en>>
Together with my colleague, Aleksandr Postyka, we will present the arguments on admissibility and merits of the Moser case.

<<3826.65;3838.73;en>>
The Moser case is different from other cases on the violation of human rights, including absolute rights, because it is critical to establish the jurisdiction and responsibilities of the defendant states.

<<3838.73;3844.89;en>>
The pleading will analyze the most important aspects regarding both the admissibility and the merits of the case.

<<3844.89;3860.25;en>>
Honorable court, we would like to underline the most important circumstances demonstrate any lack of doubt about the way the facts took place, because both governments claim not to have sufficient information about the fact of the case.

<<3860.25;3871.53;en>>
Referring to the first aspect on arrest and detention of the applicant, we will note that the facto arrest took place on 24 November 2008 in Tiraspol City.

<<3871.53;3877.87;en>>
The arrest was done by the employees of a very influential private company with residence in Tiraspol.

<<3877.87;3885.49;en>>
Upon detention, the applicant was accused that he caused damage to a respective company for $40,000 US.

<<3885.49;3898.21;en>>
Also then, the applicant was subjected to psychological pressure from the security agents and was threatened with a prolonged detention and arrest of family members if he failed to recognize the guilt.

<<3898.21;3913.77;en>>
Immediately upon obtaining the statement of the self-incrimination, the applicant was handed into the custody of the so-called local direction of fight against economic crimes and later placed in the preventive detention isolator from Tiraspol.

<<3913.77;3923.65;en>>
On 26 November 2008, the so-called Tiraspol People's Court ruled to apply arrest regarding the applicant and to keep him in the detention isolator.

<<3923.65;3935.33;en>>
The period of detention of the applicant was extended by the same time court seven times, while all the complaints of the applicants against the extension of arrest were rejected.

<<3935.33;3947.85;en>>
All the decisions contained the same rationale and followed the provision of local court that allows extended arrest solely because the applicant has grave charge brought against him.

<<3947.85;3962.41;en>>
Finally, after the court communicated the case on 1st July 2010, the so-called Tiraspol People's Court has issued a sentence by which it ruled the applicant guilty of theft of owner's property and especially large amounts.

<<3962.41;3970.65;en>>
The applicant was applied the punishment of seven years of deprivation of liberty with a suspension for five years.

<<3970.65;3984.85;en>>
Revisiting the goal of the lawsuit initiated by the company, it is very clear that the applicant was threatened that he would not be freed until he will not pay the damage that was initially estimated at $40,000 US.

<<3984.85;3998.25;en>>
The materials of the case confirmed that even after the relatives of the applicant gathered this amount and paid the claim damage, in December 2008, the applicant continued to be held in detention.

<<3998.25;4008.05;en>>
Starting with July 2009, the applicant was brought another charge of causing damages to the company in the total amount more than $82,000.

<<4008.05;4014.97;en>>
To force the applicant to pay the request amounts, the tormentors subjected the applicant to psychological pressure and torture.

<<4014.97;4023.49;en>>
Being aware of the applicant chronic respiratory disease, they intentionally placed him in isolators with terrible conditions.

<<4023.49;4035.01;en>>
All the isolators were offering unhealthy conditions of detention, high humidity, lack of access to natural light, and lack of ventilation, overcrowding, and heavy smoking in the cell.

<<4035.01;4041.77;en>>
All these conditions contributed to the applicant's more and more frequent fits of coughing and suffocation.

<<4041.77;4058.85;en>>
We annexed to the materials of the case the explanation of the applicants, of the relatives, of the lawyer, all of whom confirmed that in the first four months of detention, the applicant was constantly refused any medical assistance and he was intentionally placed in increasingly horrible conditions.

<<4058.85;4069.25;en>>
In May 2009, the doctors confirmed his prior diagnosis and that he had frequent suffocation fits with respiratory insufficiency of second and third degree.

<<4069.25;4079.05;en>>
Even though he was placed in the medical institution of the Tiraspol Penitentiary, his state of health worsened while the treatment he was given were superficial.

<<4079.05;4088.05;en>>
Thereby, on 15 February 2010, doctors found that the respiratory dysfunction continued to worsen and no effect of therapy was noticeable.

<<4088.05;4096.37;en>>
A continuing negative dynamic was observed, with an increase in the frequency of suffocation fits and increased difficulty in stopping them.

<<4096.37;4105.65;en>>
The evidence shows that the board of the doctors from the penitentiary institution concluded that the applicant's life expectancy was not favorable.

<<4105.65;4118.09;en>>
Nevertheless, immediately after the terminal diagnosis, the applicant was placed in the Hlynaya Penitentiary that featured even more horrible condition while the treatment stopped.

<<4118.09;4121.61;en>>
Consequently, we face a clear violation of Article 2 of Convention.

<<4121.61;4133.65;en>>
The administration that was applying the detention knew perfectly well that the medical diagnosis of the applicant, the critical state of his health, and the fatal consequences of any delay in treatment.

<<4133.65;4143.53;en>>
Even though they knew of his medical problems, the representative of administration intentionally used his illness of the applicant as an element of blackmailing.

<<4143.53;4149.13;en>>
They failed to offer any assistance, which practically meant a sentence to slow death.

<<4149.13;4157.09;en>>
One more aspect that should be stressed is that the applicant did realize that he could die because not having proper medical assistance.

<<4157.09;4163.73;en>>
Regarding the conditions under which he was placed, the explanation of the relatives and of the applicant himself are clear.

<<4163.73;4172.77;en>>
They show that the conditions of detention of the international and Slobozia isolators, as well as in the Penitentiary of Hlynaya, are inhuman and degrading.

<<4172.77;4182.17;en>>
The inhuman detention conditions in the Transnistria region were found by the UN experts and the special rapporteurs, as well as the so-called responsible for human rights in the region.

<<4182.17;4191.37;en>>
This report described the condition in the same way as the applicant did and his relatives are describing them in the materials annexed of the case.

<<4191.37;4204.01;en>>
The reports also show that in 2007 alone, in the detention isolators from the region, 15 inmates died due to the illness, while in 2008, 30 inmates died due to the illness.

<<4204.01;4210.41;en>>
The most frequent deaths occurred to the respiratory illness and specifically the tuberculosis.

<<4210.41;4220.37;en>>
Regarding the capacity of isolators, medical centers to carry the needed drugs, a deficiency of 94% of needed resources was found.

<<4220.37;4237.29;en>>
Reflecting on all the arguments and evidence presented, we conclude that a violation of Article 3 of the Convention must be found due to denial of appropriate medical assistance and being held in a human condition of detention, destabilizing his state of health even further.

<<4237.29;4247.45;en>>
As we notice in our written observations, the above-mentioned violations were generated by the lack of a legal system and of an adequate justice system.

<<4247.45;4257.13;en>>
The court created in this territory cannot guarantee and defend elementary human rights because they themselves violate these rights.

<<4257.13;4268.47;en>>
Thereby, according to the international law, in contested territory needs to act a function, the justice system of the state that exercise the jurisdiction over these territories.

<<4268.47;4281.85;en>>
In reality, though, on the contested territory, the so-called justice and investigation bodies apply the so-called local legislation, which is a hybrid of Soviet legislation with that of the Russian Federation.

<<4281.85;4291.81;en>>
These acts fail to provide any clear guarantees that would ensure the lack of arbitrary action when deciding the arrest or detention of the person.

<<4291.81;4297.53;en>>
For example, the appeals against the application of arrest are exempt in the absence of defense.

<<4297.53;4306.05;en>>
The detention can be extended on the sole motive of grave charge, while once the case is sent for examination, the need for detention is not verified.

<<4306.05;4311.73;en>>
These provisions are inconsistent with the provision of the convention and the case law of the court.

<<4311.73;4329.25;en>>
Elaborating on the idea of lawfulness of the tribunal, we will support the statements of Moldova government in this observation of 31 October 2014, which recognized the violation of Article 5 in this respect, reasoning that so-called courts of justice from the region failed to correspond to this criteria of legality.

<<4329.25;4332.45;en>>
This assertion is supported fully by the applicant.

<<4332.45;4353.21;en>>
In this context, we will cite here what is, of course, known from the precedents of the High Court, including some were referenced in these questions, in which it hypothetically admitted that an international unrecognized structure that effectively controls a part of the territory of member states of the convention could order the detention of a person.

<<4353.21;4362.65;en>>
This condition can be accepted only if it operates under certain constitutional and legislative provision that reflect a judicial tradition compatible with the convention.

<<4362.65;4374.33;en>>
In the contrario, a structure that does not meet at least these two requirements cannot order the legal custody and detention of a person for the purpose of Article 5, Paragraph 1 of convention.

<<4374.33;4386.93;en>>
Conversely, a body established by law must satisfy a number of conditions would include independence, especially from the executive impartiality, a duration of mandate of its members, and the guarantees of the judicial process.

<<4386.93;4396.45;en>>
The Article 5 of the convention is best treated as the forming two distinct sets of provision, set of the legality of detention and the procedural safeguards for detainees.

<<4396.45;4400.89;en>>
We will underline the principle of international law, ex injura just non oritor.

<<4400.89;4404.39;en>>
The phrase implies that unjust act cannot create law.

<<4404.39;4414.19;en>>
The court particularly noted that this principle dictates that acts which are contrary to international law cannot become a source of legal acts for the wrongdoer.

<<4414.19;4424.25;en>>
To grant recognition of illegal acts or situation will tend to perpetuate them and be beneficial to the so-called state, which has acted illegally.

<<4424.25;4433.41;en>>
In this sense, it is very important to remember that transnistria entities apply neither the legislation of Republic of Moldova nor that of the Russian Federation.

<<4433.41;4444.65;en>>
They apply their own sort of legislation, which is by far not compatible with the standards outlined in the convention when it comes to a person's liberty and security.

<<4444.65;4459.09;en>>
Those, the acts of the so-called authorities issued and complies with the laws enforced within the so-called MRT should, in principle, be regarded as having no legal basis in domestic law for the purpose of the convention.

<<4459.09;4466.29;en>>
As to the lawfulness of arrest and detention ordered by MRT courts and other MRT authorities, we should stress the following.

<<4466.29;4476.93;en>>
The regime established in transnistria region through armed force and bloodshedding is illegal, as well as the institutions created by this entity are illegal from the perspective of international law.

<<4476.93;4491.21;en>>
These bodies are not established by law and therefore do not have the competence to order the applicant's lawful arrest or detention within the meaning of Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the convention, especially because they do not meet the condition of independence and impartiality.

<<4491.21;4500.93;en>>
Regarding to the violation of the right to private and family life, we will mention that from November 2008 until May 2009, the applicant was not allowed to see his parents.

<<4500.93;4514.45;en>>
During those few visits which were allowed thereafter, such as on the 16th February 2010, they were not allowed to speak their own language, German, but were forced to speak Russian under penalty of interrupting the meeting.

<<4514.45;4524.29;en>>
In June, September 2009, his Lutheran pastor from Norway attempted to see the applicant at the latest request in order to provide him with religious services.

<<4524.29;4530.45;en>>
The applicant's pastor was finally allowed to see the applicant on 1st February 2010.

<<4530.45;4538.73;en>>
We will refer here to the conclusions that the court reached in the case of Ivan Sokov v. Russian Moldova in Paragraph 141, 42,

<<4538.73;4544.09;en>>
where it's mentioned that the restriction could not have any legal nature.

<<4544.09;4549.21;en>>
Consequently, a violation of Article 8 and 9 of the convention was committed regarding the applicant.

<<4549.21;4560.65;en>>
Honorable court, we consider that the facts are fully supported by evidence, and they will allow the court to admit that a violation of the applicant's rights occurred.

<<4560.65;4567.25;en>>
In the following lines, my colleague will present the arguments regarding the jurisdiction and the degree of responsibility of the independent states.

<<4567.25;4567.25;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4569.69;4572.37;en>>
Thank you, Mrs. Hriplivii.

<<4572.37;4574.37;en>>
I give now the floor to Mr. Alexandru Postica.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<4576.8;4579.12;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<4579.12;4588.82;en>>
my colleague mentioned in the first intervention that the present case is different from other similar cases of torture due to the issue of jurisdiction and responsibility.

<<4588.82;4605.24;en>>
The argument that we will present here will refer to the general issues regarding jurisdiction of the defendant states over the Transnistria region during the period of alleged violation and the argument regarding the degree of responsibility of the states for these violations.

<<4605.24;4618.68;en>>
The applicant supports the opinion of the Republic of Moldova government regarding the double jurisdiction that needs to be applied generally to all cases of violation of human rights that take place in the MRT.

<<4618.68;4635.05;en>>
The applicant maintains that the facts that he is complaining about fall within the jurisdiction of Republic of Moldova as an expression of its territorial jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation because of the effective control over the secessionist administration.

<<4635.05;4644.84;en>>
In the judgment of Ilashko, Kattan, and Ivancok, the court has already underlined the principles that govern the assumptions of jurisdiction for both states.

<<4644.84;4651.22;en>>
The court analyzed all periods starting with 1998 until 2007.

<<4651.22;4661.68;en>>
We consider that there is not the case in place for any possible challenge of the elements that have been already established by high court in its irrevocable judgments.

<<4661.68;4673.84;en>>
Thereby, regarding the jurisdiction of the Republic of Moldova, we will underline that the high court in the Kattan decision has already pronounced state formally over the jurisdiction of Moldova.

<<4673.84;4683.12;en>>
Even though Moldova has a limited control over the territory of the Transnistria region, this region is recognized under public international law as part of Moldova's territory.

<<4683.12;4696.62;en>>
This gives rise to an obligation under Article 1 of the Convention to use all legal and diplomatic means available to it continuing to guarantee the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention to those living there.

<<4696.62;4704.09;en>>
Consequently, from July 2007 until July 2010, the situation regarding the Moldovan jurisdiction did not change.

<<4704.09;4707.36;en>>
And there is no evidence to the contrary.

<<4707.36;4722.76;en>>
Regarding the Russian Federation, we need to underline that the principles under which an effective control over an area outside its national territory can be the basis of the state's jurisdiction is well established and was affirmed recently in Alskiny case.

<<4722.76;4733.97;en>>
Under this court's case law, jurisdiction can be established extraterritorially through a state's military, economic, and political support for a local subordinate administration.

<<4733.97;4741.84;en>>
This provides it with influence and control over the region where the administration survives by virtue of that support.

<<4741.84;4751.97;en>>
In our case, MRT administration can readily be characterized as a subordinate local administration through which the Russian Federation exercised effective control.

<<4751.97;4776.56;en>>
In the events of judgment, the court, in assessing whether the ex-complaint came within the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation, noted that political, financial, and economic support was, up to June 2007, still being provided to the administration, and that Russian troops and equipment remained in the territory contrary to Moldovan law and in breach of the commitment to withdraw completely for MRT.

<<4776.56;4791.92;en>>
Here we need to analyze those aspects that the court considered crucial in determining the jurisdiction and degree of responsibility, and namely, the military control, the control over the policies implemented by the secessionist administration, and the economic control of the region.

<<4791.92;4800.01;en>>
These grounds created and continue to maintain a puppet administration directed and controlled by the state that supported the Russian Federation.

<<4800.01;4802.92;en>>
The first aspect refers to the military.

<<4802.92;4809.92;en>>
Specifically, this aspect remains the most sensitive in the relation of the international community with the Russian Federation.

<<4809.92;4815.97;en>>
There are now 15 years since the Russian Federation committed to withdraw the troops from the territory of Moldova.

<<4815.97;4822.28;en>>
And until now, it failed to act upon its commitments to the international community.

<<4822.28;4830.44;en>>
Regarding the situation of the number of the soldiers, the question is regarding the manner how the soldiers are counted.

<<4830.44;4840.64;en>>
If it is in the numbers of soldiers who wear the Russian uniform with its insignia, we admit that it could match the number present by the Russian government.

<<4840.64;4849.09;en>>
However, let us not forget about the soldiers that lack insignia or the number of so-called green soldiers without any insignia.

<<4849.09;4850.56;en>>
One thing is clear.

<<4850.56;4854.4;en>>
Regardless of the number of soldiers, it is important who is behind them.

<<4854.4;4862.92;en>>
The recent events in Crimea and the eastern region of the UK demonstrate that not the number of soldiers counts, but whose interests they defend.

<<4862.92;4871.6;en>>
The Russian Federation continued to have military presence in MRT during the time that the rights and interests of the applicant were violated.

<<4871.6;4877.09;en>>
And secondly, the Russian Federation lacks intention to withdraw these ammunitions.

<<4877.09;4891.56;en>>
This was made clear and straightforward in the statement of high ranks official from the Russian Federation during the ratification of the 2009 memorandum that the weapons will be withdrawn after the political solution of the conflict.

<<4891.56;4896.4;en>>
The question, in fact, is what does political solution of the conflict actually mean?

<<4896.4;4904.09;en>>
In the opinion of the MRT administration, conflict resolution means the independence of the region and its integration to the Russian Federation.

<<4904.09;4915.44;en>>
So the purpose of this military presence in MRT is not, as the Russian Federation suggests, in its written submission, in order to carry out peacekeeping or guard a stockpile of weapons.

<<4915.44;4926.6;en>>
Instead, it is to maintain an effective authority over the territory, including by maintaining the capacity to react to events and secure the position of MRT.

<<4926.6;4930.52;en>>
Honorable Court, the European Court has followed the general rules.

<<4930.52;4941.32;en>>
It does not require evidence of complete dependence on and the control of an outside state for international wrongful conduct of a secessionist de facto regime.

<<4941.32;4957.56;en>>
In the Lashko case, the court expanded the scope of responsibility beyond that of effective overall control, determining that the responsibility of the Russian Federation for the guarantee of the convention rights was triggered by the action of the MRT.

<<4957.56;4970.28;en>>
The court also took into account the political support provided in the establishment of the separatist regime and in enabling it to survive and maintain its autonomy in relation to Moldova.

<<4970.28;4987.2;en>>
The stated objective of the convention to avoid a regrettable vacuum in the system of human rights protection in the territory in question includes a requirement to ensure that an outside state is held responsible for extensive support for secessionist groups without the need to prove that.

<<4987.2;4994.05;en>>
In each specific instance of violation, the de facto regime was under the control of the outside state.

<<4994.05;5012.7;en>>
The Russian Federation dismisses the court's finding in the Lashko, Ivancok, and in Katan cases of political influence over the MRT administration, starting that there is no evidence to suggest any role in what it refers to as the emergence of the problem.

<<5012.7;5018.52;en>>
This opinion is repealed by the evidence that Russia Duma has provided to the international community.

<<5018.52;5034.1;en>>
We refer to the report of the Russian Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security, adopted in 2010, which stated the desire to increase its influence over the political and military leadership of the MRT.

<<5034.1;5044.22;en>>
This is consistent with the findings of the court on the nature and extent of its support for and collaboration with the MRT separatist regime.

<<5044.22;5056.52;en>>
The case contains evidence confirming that after 2007, until now, existed tens of visits of high Russian officials who supported the actions of the separatist leaders.

<<5056.52;5059.84;en>>
Even nowadays, Mr. Pushko, head of the Russian delegation

<<5059.84;5068.62;en>>
at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, stated that Russia holds the key to resolution of the conflict in Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova.

<<5068.62;5075.6;en>>
Regarding the financial assistance to the separatist regime, Russia fails to deny that it supports the secessionist regime.

<<5075.6;5089.4;en>>
The call declared by the Russian government to help the local population is noble, but its effect contributes more to the proliferation of the regime rather than to increasing the well-being of the population.

<<5089.4;5098.6;en>>
So the statement that the Russian Federation is elevating the state of the population through humanitarian aid means to only tell half of the truth.

<<5098.6;5100.52;en>>
We have to be fair here.

<<5100.52;5104.28;en>>
Russia breaches both Moldova and its own legislation.

<<5104.28;5114.12;en>>
This process can be called a forced introduction of aid, and its nature is similar with the columns of aid offered to pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.

<<5114.12;5128.62;en>>
I will also quote here an important media outlet from the Russian Federation, which only a week ago mentioned that for the first time, the Russian Federation failed to offer the MRT financial aid in the amount of $100 million US.

<<5128.62;5150.88;en>>
Consequently, honorable court, we can easily reach a conclusion that from June 2007 until the applicant was freed from detention in 2010, the Russian Federation exercised its jurisdiction over the self-proclaimed MRT territory, being undoubtedly the sponsor, mentor, and the defender of the separatist regime, which frequently violated the rights of the applicant.

<<5150.88;5158.72;en>>
Honorable court, another issue not less important than the jurisdiction is the responsibility of the government and the domestic remedies.

<<5158.72;5162.84;en>>
I will anticipate certain questions which, in my view, need to be asked and answered.

<<5162.84;5164.48;en>>
Here they are.

<<5164.48;5168.36;en>>
Should the applicant contest the sentence of February 2010?

<<5168.36;5174.16;en>>
Should the applicant have complained to the court of Republic of Moldova and claim damages for illegal detention?

<<5174.16;5180.52;en>>
What kind of measures should take the state that has the jurisdiction over the territory?

<<5180.52;5190.05;en>>
Here I would like to reiterate the principle of international law, according to which a criminal punishment can only be applied in the name of the internationally recognized state.

<<5190.05;5200.6;en>>
I will remind the honorable court about the arguments brought by the previous speakers regarding the illegality of the institution and functioning of so-called court in MRT.

<<5200.6;5216.66;en>>
I would also mention that any possible acceptance of these courts as competent to order the applicant's arrest or detention to condemn persons in the name of a non-existent state would short-circuit the entire legal system of the Republic of Moldova.

<<5216.66;5222.05;en>>
However, the Republic of Moldova recognizes it's the jurisdiction in this territory.

<<5222.05;5239.18;en>>
Moreover, in the condition that the government itself recognizes the illegality of these courts, the admission of any such conclusion would undermine the law of the state in exercising its jurisdiction, a fact that is incompatible with the provision of the convention.

<<5239.18;5245.64;en>>
I will continue with the first assertion why the applicant did not appeal the sentence of 1st July 2010.

<<5245.64;5253.4;en>>
Theoretically, appealing a condemnation sentence should offer the applicant a chance to be acquitted, honorable court.

<<5253.4;5268.68;en>>
When after 20 months of detention, one is given the opportunity to run from their torturers, one does not stay to prove its innocence through a justice system lacking illegality and credibility, which admitted that such illegal acts took place.

<<5268.68;5273.44;en>>
The applicant's sole objective was to remain alive and secure personal safety.

<<5273.44;5280.2;en>>
Once he left the region, was it of any use to appeal the decision in the local courts?

<<5280.2;5287.32;en>>
The applicant lacked intention to return to the region, so this sentence is not relevant to him under any form.

<<5287.32;5295.84;en>>
This sentence cannot be considered as a valid act, neither according to international practice, nor according to the practice of the Court of Republic of Moldova.

<<5295.84;5310.56;en>>
This sentence of condemnation of the applicant cannot be executed at all in the area of the Council of Europe, apart from territory of Abkhazia, Ossetia, and so-called popular republic of Luhansk and Donetsk, which are all seemingly supported by the Russian Federation.

<<5310.56;5324.28;en>>
Not least, appealing the sentence in MRT court and any possible annulment could not offer remedy to the violated rights, and as the object of the application is unlawful arrest and detention.

<<5324.28;5332.56;en>>
The proposals of the Moldovan government to exhaust domestic remedies through asking damages for illegal detention is both unclear and contradictory.

<<5332.56;5338.72;en>>
Firstly, the Moldovan government mentions that it is not responsible for the detention of the applicant.

<<5338.72;5344.66;en>>
However, the Moldovan government asked the applicant to solicit damages for his detention.

<<5344.66;5358.05;en>>
Regarding the responsibility of both states, we will remind the Honorable Court that the Russian Federation is responsible for the violation of the applicant's rights, given its large support to MRT administration.

<<5358.05;5365.52;en>>
On the responsibility of the Republic of Moldova and the way it is executing this positive obligation, we need to analyze two factors.

<<5365.52;5372.05;en>>
The Republic of Moldova, through its general passivity regarding the illegal detentions, admitted the perpetration of these violations.

<<5372.05;5379.56;en>>
And secondly, the constitutional authority acted late and inefficiently in this concrete case.

<<5379.56;5387.16;en>>
Generally speaking, the actions of the Moldovan government are reduced to sending letters on the political resolution of the Trans-Siberian conflict.

<<5387.16;5398.48;en>>
The government failed to present to the High Court any eloquent and consistent demarches on the fact that it raised the issue of illegal detention and illegal court functioning in MRT.

<<5398.48;5417.92;en>>
With the international forums at the general level, or at least at the level of negotiation of the Trans-Siberian conflict resolution, Moldovan government failed to create an adequate and functional infrastructure for courts of justice, prosecution, and police bodies for the rails from the left bank of the Dniester River.

<<5417.92;5429.52;en>>
Moldovan government failed to conduct a prompt and proper criminal investigation and the alleged illegal action against the applicant committed by the employees of a private company and MRT administration.

<<5429.52;5436.76;en>>
Even after the applicant was released from detention, the prosecution refused to provide him with relevant and prompt protection.

<<5436.76;5452.2;en>>
In conclusion, we insist that the responsibility of the Republic of Moldova needs to be assumed equally to that of the Russian Federation, and that both governments bear equal responsibility for the violation of the applicant's rights in this particular case.

<<5452.2;5459.3;en>>
We also hope that the judgment in this case will not limit to the situation in the past, but will also help avoiding such violations in the future.

<<5459.3;5459.36;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5463.61;5466.11;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Postica.

<<5467.81;5475.17;en>>
Turn now to the judges and I would ask them if there are questions.

<<5475.17;5477.17;en>>
Judge Luis López Guerra.

[[Judge;Luis López Guerra]]

<<5482.47;5484.47;en>>
Thank you Mr. President.

<<5484.47;5491.47;en>>
I would like to make some questions to all three parties because they referred to some information.

<<5491.47;5506.35;en>>
It has been raised, the issue by the Moldovan government, by the applicant, of the unlawfulness of the so-called MRT court, derived mostly from two facts.

<<5506.35;5512.63;en>>
First, that this court has not been created in accordance with Moldovan legislation.

<<5512.63;5523.89;en>>
Secondly, because the whole general political system of public authorities, or the so-called MRT, is not recognized by the international community, by any country.

<<5523.89;5526.11;en>>
So that is the reason for unlawfulness.

<<5526.11;5550.07;en>>
I would like to ask if, independently from this lack of international recognition, whether the parties can somehow inform us whether the MRT courts, and particularly the Tiraspol People's Court, comply or do not comply with the requisites of any due process court.

<<5550.07;5554.23;en>>
That is mostly the independence and impartiality.

<<5554.23;5561.11;en>>
I mean, what is the information on the material conditions in this respect of this court.

<<5561.11;5580.07;en>>
And the second question, which is more or less related, it has been raised, the issue of the irresponsibility of the Russian Federation, allegedly, as the territory of the MRT is under effective Russian control, in all aspects.

<<5580.07;5601.75;en>>
So my question is, can we get some information whether the MRT judicial system follows or does not follow the general organizational lines of the Russian Federation judicial system, as could be deduced for the effective control of the Russian Federation.

<<5601.75;5601.75;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5605.93;5606.89;en>>
Judge Villiger.

[[Judge;Mark Villiger]]

<<5609.93;5611.53;en>>
Thank you, President.

<<5611.53;5619.45;en>>
A question to the parties which follows actually the question of Judge López Guerra.

<<5619.45;5625.45;en>>
It concerns the independence of the courts of the Moldovan Transnistrian Republic, the MRT.

<<5625.45;5632.89;en>>
My question is, how is the independence of the courts in the MRT assured?

<<5632.89;5632.89;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5637.88;5639.56;en>>
Thank you, no other questions.

<<5639.56;5652.84;en>>
So the court will now rise for 15 minutes, following which the parties will return for a second round of short pleadings to respond to the submissions in the first round and also to the judges' questions.

[[Announcer;UNK]]

<<5723.64;5724.32;fr>>
La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5769.88;5773.72;en>>
So the hearing is resumed. I call Mr. Apostol. Please be seated.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<5780.16;5785.24;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President and honorable judges of the Grand Chamber.

<<5785.24;5793.16;en>>
First, I would reply briefly on the questions raised by judges.

<<5793.16;5802.52;en>>
Indeed, there are two questions, and one question relates in particular and follows the other question.

<<5802.52;5825.28;en>>
This is about the sole question of the entire hearings which we are having here, is whether the so-called tribunals in Transnistrian region can or not guarantee fair trials and whether they afford minimum guarantees of that fair trial.

<<5825.28;5864.3;en>>
My position of the government is clear that they cannot do this, and for this I would refer the attention of the Grand Chamber to our written submissions where we quoted, among other things, we quoted the last – the report of our last visit made by high UN official in the region who in details examined – have examined these so-called tribunals and so-called legislation.

<<5864.3;5875.42;en>>
And his main conclusions were that so-called tribunals do not comply with minimum fair trial standards.

<<5875.42;5878.6;en>>
They cannot be considered independent.

<<5878.6;5882.9;en>>
So the government endorsed these findings.

<<5882.9;5897.4;en>>
And I would add also other most important thing, that the most important guarantee of fair trial is the legality of a tribunal.

<<5897.4;5902.18;en>>
So only legality can guarantee independence.

<<5902.18;5911.38;en>>
And when de facto unrecognized regime establishes its own judicial system, it cannot be independent.

<<5911.38;5912.38;en>>
Why?

<<5912.38;5925.78;en>>
Because this system serves the purposes of that de facto unlawful regime, and it sustains this unlawful regime.

<<5925.78;5938.8;en>>
So the scope of such a judicial system is not a protection of human rights, but the interest of private persons within the de facto local administration.

<<5938.8;5943.56;en>>
So the present case actually reveals this very aspect.

<<5943.56;5955.2;en>>
So we cannot see them as independent, because they are outside the very simple principles of law.

<<5955.2;5979.0;en>>
So as to the last question, does the so-called tribunals or judicial system within the MRT follows the judicial system of Russian Federation, or at least repeats some minimum guarantees offered by Russian Federation?

<<5979.0;5985.94;en>>
Believe me, this question is very difficult to reply in 10 minutes.

<<5985.94;5989.96;en>>
I would say that, first of all, it is not.

<<5989.96;5996.4;en>>
Because first of all, the Russian judicial system is very, very complex.

<<5996.4;6002.08;en>>
I would say that the Russian judicial system is a federal judicial system.

<<6002.08;6009.08;en>>
There are a lot of norms and regulations.

<<6009.08;6011.0;en>>
It's very difficult.

<<6011.0;6014.12;en>>
We can compare only comparable things.

<<6014.12;6015.88;en>>
This is not comparable things.

<<6015.88;6028.96;en>>
That is why I would say that from this point of view, the so-called judicial system of MRT cannot follow that judicial system.

<<6028.96;6038.48;en>>
It claims an affiliation, but this is not judicial gathering of the same principles.

<<6038.48;6051.28;en>>
And second, the MRT judicial system claims, and this is important, that MRT judicial system claims its own individuality.

<<6051.28;6068.6;en>>
And it comprises a kind of old Soviet regulations, which these Soviet regulations in itself are against the convention principles and the proposals of the convention.

<<6068.6;6093.76;en>>
So I would say that we cannot say that the judicial system is the so-called judicial system in the Transnistrian region is at least comparable with any system in existence in the special edict of the convention.

<<6093.76;6108.96;en>>
So this is briefly replies to the question, and I would say that I would use this opportunity also to reply to the applicants' submissions and to the Russian government's pleadings.

<<6108.96;6119.4;en>>
Very briefly, the Russian government continues to say that it has no responsibility because it has no jurisdiction.

<<6119.4;6139.32;en>>
But on the other hand, as from the pleadings of my colleague, representative of Russian Federation, we say it is clear that the Russian Federation continues to support, there is a continuous military presence.

<<6139.32;6159.6;en>>
So my view, and the present court view, was that the continued presence, military presence, the continued support rises a presumption of jurisdiction and the responsibility.

<<6159.6;6167.68;en>>
So this is up to the Russian government to prove otherwise that they do not bear responsibility.

<<6167.68;6177.68;en>>
Unfortunately, from the pleadings, I haven't seen any rebuttal of this presumption.

<<6177.68;6189.56;en>>
Otherwise, I was convinced, actually, in fact, that the jurisdiction of Russian Federation and the overall control of the region still exists.

<<6189.56;6219.88;en>>
And briefly on the applicant's suggestion, in particular, that the so-called remedies provided, I emphasize here, provided by the Moldovan government by means of judicial recognizing official judicial recognizing by the Supreme Court, by our Supreme Court, that the so-called tribunals are unlawful and cannot deliver judgments and annulling those judgments.

<<6219.88;6232.12;en>>
And thereafter, our government suggested that this, our Supreme Court, can be as a means for, at least, compensation.

<<6232.12;6247.04;en>>
This is very difficult, believe me, for the Republic of Moldova to support, to respond for the actions of other persons, private persons.

<<6247.04;6249.28;en>>
So this was a suggestion.

<<6249.28;6259.56;en>>
This was a suggestion that I would say that our Supreme Court provided at least partial just satisfaction.

<<6259.56;6284.34;en>>
And given that the Republic of Moldova has its positive obligation to do whatever possible to redress the applicants, these suggestions, this system, and these conclusions provided by the Supreme, our Supreme Court, this is an expression of our positive obligations.

<<6284.34;6298.76;en>>
So the whole idea of this case, that somebody should do something, and the Republic of Moldova, the government of Republic of Moldova is not silent, and it does something.

<<6298.76;6311.42;en>>
Indeed, in lack of effective control, and this was findings of the present court in the Ilashko case, in lack of effective control, we cannot guarantee as much as possible.

<<6311.42;6318.28;en>>
What we should do, our government should do what is possible for them, and we are doing this.

<<6318.28;6344.06;en>>
So this is the reply to the applicant complaints, and I think I would guarantee that our government will continue, indeed, this is our positive obligation, to continue all efforts to sustain the applicants in their redress, and to at least as it possible to guarantee respect of human rights in that region.

<<6344.06;6345.32;en>>
Thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<6349.23;6351.31;en>>
I call Mr. Matyushkin.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<6359.53;6367.89;en>>
Mr. President, as regard the questions of Judge Villiger

<<6367.89;6386.85;en>>
and Judge Guerra, the Russian government once again emphasized that the lack of effective control over Transnistria and their judicial bodies act independently from Russian Federation.

<<6386.85;6407.31;en>>
I would also like to bring the Court's attention to today's submission of my respectable vis-a-vis Mr. Apostol, in which he told that the judgment of MIT

<<6407.31;6415.29;en>>
Court against the applicant was quashed by Moldova Court.

<<6415.29;6425.53;en>>
It seems to me that this fact speaks of a certain degree of control over MIT courts by Moldova.

<<6428.85;6448.17;en>>
And I should shortly refer to their submission of Mr. Postika and stress that, by my opinion,

<<6448.17;6453.97;en>>
the Court hearing is not the place for political speculations.

<<6453.97;6463.89;en>>
During the whole history of Transnistrian conflict, no one before Mr. Postika had accused Russia

<<6463.89;6477.25;en>>
of the presence of unaccounted military servicemen on the territory of Transnistria, including the Moldovan government.

<<6477.25;6490.01;en>>
And now we see some invention in this issue.

<<6490.01;6506.17;en>>
And secondly, I consider absolutely improper to draw any parallel between the situation in the eastern Ukraine and in present case in Transnistria.

<<6506.17;6520.01;en>>
First of all, because now some cases concerning internal Ukrainian conflict, Ukrainian crisis, are pending before the Court.

<<6523.69;6544.53;en>>
And secondly, because from the factual point of view, I could bring the attention to the interview, which was made by Ukrainian TV by chief of general staff of Ukrainian army.

<<6544.53;6546.65;en>>
It was three days ago.

<<6546.65;6556.57;en>>
In this interview, this chief commander of Ukrainian army recognized that no Russian troops in eastern Ukraine.

<<6561.01;6573.77;en>>
And finally, it is undisputable that international courts and tribunals are key actors in international law.

<<6573.77;6584.25;en>>
However, it is our strong belief that no court of law, including international one, is entitled to take on the role it was never officially delegated.

<<6584.25;6610.17;en>>
At present, it is more necessary than ever before that all international judicial bodies adhere to the mainstream public international law, as it has been shaped by the jurisprudence of the overwhelming majority of international courts and tribunals, in order to avoid any further contribution to the fragmentation of international law.

<<6610.17;6642.69;en>>
In this connection, I once again urge the Court to take this opportunity and to freshly examine, in the light of the mainstream public international law, the sensitive issue in question, so as to contribute to the peaceful cooperation of the member states, and not to increase the controversies between them, but to find a balanced approach which will correspond to the objective picture of their international relations.

<<6642.69;6642.69;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<6649.27;6650.71;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<6650.71;6651.79;en>>
Who wants to take the floor?

<<6651.79;6656.99;en>>
Ms. Hriplivii or? Mr Postica, please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<6660.62;6683.06;en>>
With regard to the first and the third questions, we should note that in our observation of 31 of October, from paragraph 27 until paragraph 45, we presented the analysis regarding the functioning of the so-called course in MRT.

<<6683.06;6699.3;en>>
The manner of the naming of the judges, and we can conclude that these cannot be considered independent because the judges totally depend on the so-called president of the region, who can at any time name, dismiss, or transfer so-called judges.

<<6699.3;6705.32;en>>
There is no independent body that would regulate the activity of the judges in the region.

<<6705.32;6720.82;en>>
Regarding the impartiality of the judges in this particular case, we underline the fact that the applicant was accused by one of the most influential company called Sharif, which is the larger contributor to the local budget.

<<6720.82;6729.68;en>>
And we consider that this fact led to a prolonged detention of extortion of money from the applicant's family.

<<6729.68;6746.86;en>>
Regarding the second question, I should mention that starting with 2 August 2006, the region started the so-called process of harmonization of its so-called legislation from the region to that of the Russian Federation.

<<6746.86;6749.22;en>>
We presented the proofs of that.

<<6749.22;6759.34;en>>
Moreover, on 26 June 2007, based on this decree, was adopted the concept of harmonization of the local norms with the law of the Russian Federation.

<<6759.34;6772.38;en>>
This harmonization, in fact, involves the prerogative of the committee to examine and compare any act adopted by so-called legislative and executive bodies of the region to those of the Russian legislation.

<<6772.38;6776.1;en>>
The Russian Federation failed to contest this harmonization process.

<<6776.1;6781.78;en>>
Instead, it supported it through signing several commitments with the separatist leaders.

<<6781.78;6788.7;en>>
The most recent are those of July 2014 in the area of administration, education, law enforcement, and other.

<<6788.7;6793.58;en>>
All these proofs and evidence were presented to our submission.

<<6793.58;6803.5;en>>
I want to give reply to some statements made by Moldovan government and the Russian Federation government.

<<6803.5;6818.18;en>>
Referring to the legal practice created by the Supreme Court of Justice on declaring the nulity of the so-called sentence of the unrecognized authority by the Supreme Court of Justice of Republic of Moldova, this practice is clear and logical.

<<6818.18;6824.66;en>>
However, this practice cannot be considered under any form as an effective remedy for the protection of the rights of the applicant.

<<6824.66;6834.02;en>>
This decision, in fact, oblige the Moldovan government to undertake other measures, as well including to sanction those who committed illegal acts.

<<6834.02;6844.94;en>>
On the other hand, the government has to establish if the person, in fact, committed some illegal acts in order to ensure an equitable balance for the potential victims.

<<6844.94;6863.18;en>>
Regarding to the Russian Federation replies about the so-called green soldiers, I should mention that I mean the so-called Transnistrian Army, who is more numerous than the Constitutional Army.

<<6863.18;6868.18;en>>
And which is more equipped than the Constitutional Army.

<<6868.18;6879.06;en>>
And I should say that about 50% of the population of the Transnistrian region has the citizenship of the Russian Federation.

<<6879.06;6889.58;en>>
So many of the Russian citizens are soldiers of so-called Army of Transnistrian region.

<<6889.58;6892.3;en>>
That is our point of view.

<<6892.3;6892.3;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<6894.43;6895.39;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<6898.15;6900.75;en>>
Ms. Hriplivii, do you want to add something?

<<6900.75;6902.07;en>>
No?

<<6902.07;6909.71;en>>
Then we have now come to the end of the hearing, and I thank the parties for their interventions and answers to the court's questions.

<<6909.71;6915.79;en>>
The court will now deliberate on the admissibility and merits, and the judgment will be delivered later.

<<6915.79;6919.47;en>>
The parties will be informed of the date of delivery.

<<6919.47;6919.47;en>>
I declare the hearing closed.

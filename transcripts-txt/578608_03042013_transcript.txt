La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Josep Casadevall]]

<<79.47;81.23;en>>
Good morning.

<<81.23;87.51;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of Söderman v. Sweden.

<<87.51;98.75;en>>
Until recently, when the applicant decided to waive to anonymity granted to her, this case was called E.S. v. Sweden.

<<98.75;110.39;en>>
The case was lodged on the 21st of January 2008 with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention by a Swedish national, Mrs. Eliza Söderman.

<<110.39;124.91;en>>
On the 21st of June 2012, a chamber of the Fifth Section delivered its judgment in the case, finding that there had been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention.

<<124.91;145.79;en>>
On the 19th of September 2012, the applicant requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention, and the panel of the Grand Chamber accepted the request on the 19th of November 2012.

<<145.79;166.87;en>>
On 7 February 2013, the President of the Grand Chamber granted leave to the Human Rights Centre of Ghent University to submit written comments as a third party by virtue of Rule 44.3 of the Rules of the Court.

<<166.87;171.91;en>>
The government are represented by their agent, Mr. Anders Rönquist,

<<171.91;185.43;en>>
Ambassador and Director General for Legal Affairs, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, assisted by Mrs. Gunilla Isaksson and Mr. Olof Widgren, co-agents,

<<185.43;195.15;en>>
as well as Mr. Mathias Säfsten, Mrs. Viveca Lång and Mr. Carl Rosenmüller, advisors.

<<195.15;204.31;en>>
The applicant is represented by Mr. Jan Södergren, Mr. Kenneth Lewis and Clarence Crawford, counsel.

<<204.31;207.63;en>>
The applicant is also present.

<<207.63;211.87;en>>
I welcome the representatives of the parties in the name of the Court.

<<211.87;225.27;en>>
I also welcome a group of Georgian magistrates and lawyers, the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors of Turkey, as well as a group of Japanese judges who are visiting the Court.

<<225.27;243.23;en>>
I would explain that in addition to interpreting in the two official languages of the Court, English and French, interpreting into Turkish has been authorised for the benefit of the delegation of Turkish judges and prosecutors attending this hearing.

<<243.23;254.71;en>>
This interpretation is not arranged by the Court and no transcription of the oral translation will be included in the official record of the proceedings.

<<254.71;263.79;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and the representatives of the applicant, I have determined the order of address as follows.

<<263.79;272.59;en>>
Mr. Crafoord, followed by Mr. Lewis and Mr. Södergren for the applicant will speak first

<<272.59;277.15;en>>
and then Mr. Rönquist for the government.

<<277.15;277.15;en>>
I give the floor to Mr. Crafoord.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<285.75;298.11;en>>
Honorable European judges, and learned colleagues, this case is about a 14-year-old girl who was secretly filmed by her stepfather while undressing and taking a shower.

<<298.11;303.31;en>>
A serious violation of the personal integrity, and at the same time, an abuse of a child.

<<305.23;314.03;en>>
I think we all agree that the 14-year-old girl, or anyone else for that matter, should not have to be exposed to that kind of behavior.

<<314.03;334.95;en>>
We can also all agree that this once 14-year-old girl, who has now, after all the legal proceedings, turned 25, Elisa Söderman, sitting here today, did not receive any form of redress for this violation in the Swedish national system, even though she tried to.

<<335.99;342.11;en>>
And the applicant's position is that this failure is a result of a flaw in Swedish law.

<<342.11;356.35;en>>
I would like to draw the court's attention to a case from the Swedish Supreme Court, case NJA 2008, page 946, concerning covert filming in that case of an adult.

<<356.35;377.83;en>>
The Swedish Supreme Court stated the following, and I quote, it is highly questionable whether the fact that acts of filming of an individual in situations where such filming deeply violates the Swedish law and violates the personal integrity of the person concerned are left wholly unsanctioned under Swedish law.

<<377.83;382.63;en>>
Is that compatible with the requirements of Article 8 of the European Convention?

<<382.63;389.03;en>>
A fact that these acts are left wholly unsanctioned according to the Swedish Supreme Court.

<<389.03;398.71;en>>
The Swedish Supreme Court obviously found that there is such a flaw that we are talking about regarding covert filming and the Convention rights.

<<398.71;410.11;en>>
However, the Swedish Supreme Court did not find reason to go further, and instead, practically speaking, dropped this issue into the lap of the legislator.

<<410.11;430.91;en>>
We have recently seen a late recognition from the Swedish government, that is not from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but from the Ministry of Justice, that there, in fact, is such a flaw in the law, and that this flaw must be taken care of.

<<430.91;432.51;en>>
It must be blocked.

<<432.51;444.11;en>>
This is the whole meaning with the Swedish government's new proposal for legislation on offensive photography, proposal 2012-13-169.

<<444.11;451.11;en>>
However, this proposal has not yet led to any new legislation.

<<451.11;460.47;en>>
But even when, or rather if, this proposal leads to new legislation, one thing is clear.

<<460.47;467.15;en>>
It will not lead to any redress for the applicant or anyone else in her position.

<<467.15;477.59;en>>
This potential new legislation might have an effect for other future victims under the condition that this proposal eventually will pass in the Swedish parliament.

<<477.59;482.51;en>>
If that happens, it will not change the outcome for the applicant.

<<482.51;494.07;en>>
So it is now up to this grand chamber to establish if Sweden has violated the applicant's rights under Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention.

<<494.07;519.51;en>>
And we assume that when the grand chamber performs this important task, it does so with an obvious starting point in the principle of the effectiveness of the Convention, which is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory, but rights that are practical and effective.

<<519.51;524.27;en>>
That follows from, for example, the 1979 Arie v.

<<524.27;531.43;en>>
Ireland case and the 1980 Ortega v. Italy case. After this short introduction,

<<531.43;536.43;en>>
the address by the applicant will be disposed in three parts.

<<536.43;542.39;en>>
Firstly, Mr. Kenneth Lewis will evolve the question of the flaw in Swedish law which

<<542.39;554.15;en>>
resulted in this failure of the Swedish State to provide Elisa Söderman protection of her rights under Article 8. Mr. Lewis will thereafter deal with the question

<<554.15;559.15;en>>
of whether the flaw in Swedish law was significant. And after that, Mr. Jansz

<<559.15;574.83;en>>
Söderman will address the issue of the national court's positive obligation to provide sufficient protection for the rights of the Convention at the national level. The applicant is a bit mindful that the chamber did not address this issue.

<<574.83;586.03;en>>
In the applicant's opinion, this is an important issue, causing problems for the national judiciary with embarrassing results. Mr. Söderman will consequently

<<586.03;591.59;en>>
deal with this matter in some detail at the end of the applicant's presentation.

<<591.59;592.59;en>>
Honorable Ukraine judges, thank you.

[[JudgeP;Josep Casadevall]]

<<599.63;600.99;en>>
Thank you, Mr. Crafoord.

[[Applicant;AP4]]

<<602.54;616.26;en>>
Your Honors, since the presentation must be short, I refer to our observations from February, and especially our late observations from March of this year.

<<616.26;629.14;en>>
My colleague has already mentioned the opinion of the Swedish Supreme Court regarding the lack, the entire lack of sanctions for covert or illicit filming in Swedish law.

<<629.14;638.3;en>>
My colleague also mentioned that the Swedish government has proposed new legislation on offensive photography.

<<638.3;661.42;en>>
On page 10 of this proposal, the government noted that while some kinds of covert photography might be criminalized under various sections of the criminal code, jurisprudence had shown that in many cases, the courts had been unable to convict person for these offenses.

<<661.42;686.22;en>>
The government has also pointed to the present case to demonstrate that in spite of the change of judgment, which found that Sweden had not violated Elisa Söderman's rights, that three of seven judges had found that Sweden had not fulfilled its positive obligations according to Article 8 of the convention.

<<686.22;705.74;en>>
The very fact that the Swedish government has now proposed this new provision in the criminal code, which criminalizes covert photography in intimate places, is a clear demonstration that there exists a flaw in Sweden's present legislation.

<<705.74;716.9;en>>
New criminal laws are not proposed if there isn't a real lack, a lacuna, a flaw in the existing law.

<<716.9;736.42;en>>
In its observations from February 15, 2013, to the grand chamber, the Swedish government continues to maintain what we just pointed out, that the present application does not reveal any significant flaw in the Swedish law.

<<736.42;762.86;en>>
The government repeats the chamber's statements, and I quote, that although there was no specific provision in Swedish law concerning covert or illicit filming, there was a legal framework in place which could at least in theory cover acts such as the one that the applicant's stepfather was prosecuted for.

<<762.86;782.74;en>>
To demonstrate this claim, the government maintains that the stepfather was acquitted due to the lack of requisite evidence concerning certain aspects of his intent, and not due to the lack of applicable criminal provisions.

<<782.74;791.02;en>>
In our opinion, this is not a question of evidence, but rather a matter of the construction of the law.

<<791.02;805.74;en>>
It was and is possible to construe a criminal provision which criminalizes covert photography or filming as such, whether or not the victim becomes aware of it while it's taking place.

<<805.74;815.9;en>>
To construe such a crime is in fact exactly what the government is doing in its new proposal to the Swedish parliament.

<<815.9;846.86;en>>
The construction of the crime of sexual or other molestation with the requirement that the perpetrator must have the intention to let the victim become aware of the act at the moment it's carried out may certainly be criticized, since such punishable acts, as in the present case, are otherwise not covered by any other criminal provisions.

<<846.86;860.78;en>>
Obviously, it lies in the nature of covert filming that the perpetrator doesn't intend for the victim to discover that she or he is being filmed.

<<860.78;880.82;en>>
Thus, if the perpetrator has no intent that the victim, as in the present case, should discover that he was filmed and intended to use the film for his own purposes, it's meaningless, completely meaningless, to discuss in terms of establishing intent.

<<880.82;898.6;en>>
In reality, the government's claim that it was only a lack of evidence which was the problem and the reason that the stepfather was acquitted is simply an attempt to hide the flaw in the law, which Elisa's case has demonstrated.

<<898.6;909.22;en>>
It should be emphasized that what has been said concerning sexual molestation is equally relevant concerning the crime molestation.

<<909.22;935.24;en>>
The government itself, in its proposal for new legislation on offensive photography, stated the following, and I quote, a certain protection against offensive photography is stipulated in the provision concerning molestation in chapter 4, section 7 of the penal code, which protects individuals against different forms of ruthless behavior.

<<935.24;952.5;en>>
In order for the provision concerning molestation to apply, it has been found to require that the person being subject to the photographing has been aware of the photographing and in reality has been bothered by it.

<<952.5;955.22;en>>
This is the government's own statement.

<<955.22;961.7;en>>
Here, the government forgets for some reason to mention the question of the perpetrator's intent.

<<961.7;981.1;en>>
But in any case, this means that both the crime of sexual molestation and the crime molestation have the same subjective requirement and are equally inapplicable in most cases concerning covert filming.

<<981.1;992.5;en>>
The government also continues to maintain that the applicant could have invoked other grounds for her claim for damages in the criminal proceedings.

<<992.5;1009.3;en>>
The government claimed that she could have invoked as an alternative ground for her claim for damages that the offender had caused her personal injury by acting negligently, but that she had failed to do so.

<<1009.3;1016.94;en>>
It's sufficient to recall how the alleged liability was qualified by the parties in the present case.

<<1016.94;1023.82;en>>
The prosecutor defined the act in the following way in the indictment.

<<1023.82;1053.38;en>>
The defendant, the stepfather, has during the period September 2002 to autumn 2002 in the municipality of Ludwika been indecent toward Elisa, born in 1987, by on one occasion in September 2002 assembling a video camera in the bathroom and putting it in a recording mode while Elisa undressed for a shower.

<<1056.06;1064.38;en>>
Elisa's attorney filed her claim and phrased the foundation for the claim in the following manner.

<<1064.38;1076.66;en>>
Through the indicted act, the defendant has seriously violated Elisa's personal integrity and he shall therefore pay compensation for the violation.

<<1076.66;1085.54;en>>
Concerning compensation for pain and suffering, the compensation concerns mental suffering.

<<1085.54;1096.3;en>>
By the phrase indicted act, the representative referred to the prosecutor's description of the act, which was just quoted.

<<1096.3;1112.9;en>>
Elisa's attorney simply claimed that the stepfather, by his actions, which he admitted, had caused Elisa injury in the form of violation of her personal integrity and pain and suffering.

<<1112.9;1124.42;en>>
He even presented independent evidence to prove that the stepfather had caused this injury and the extent of the injury.

<<1124.42;1143.22;en>>
The Swedish law of torts, chapter 2, section 1, states, and I quote, one, that is, a person who intentionally or due to negligence causes personal injury or material damage shall indemnify the damage.

<<1143.22;1150.66;en>>
In the present case, there can be no doubt that the stepfather caused the personal injury.

<<1150.66;1159.58;en>>
Elisa's attorney presented evidence concerning the nature and extent of the personal injury she'd suffered.

<<1159.58;1174.06;en>>
It was thus possible for the court in Sweden to award damages regardless of whether the stepfather had caused the personal injury willfully or due to negligence.

<<1174.06;1181.38;en>>
The question for the court was causality as such.

<<1181.38;1191.04;en>>
In other words, Elisa's attorney did not fail in any respect by not mentioning the word negligence.

<<1191.04;1196.42;en>>
In this case, the issue of negligence also becomes somewhat bizarre.

<<1196.42;1202.54;en>>
One can hardly hold that the stepfather caused Elisa's injury due to negligence.

<<1205.56;1230.06;en>>
The rules accounted for in what I've just said rather reveal the construction error or the flaw in the law as it has been developed in Swedish domestic case law rather than that there was a failure on the part of the prosecution or Elisa's attorney.

<<1230.06;1252.54;en>>
The government continues to maintain, based on a phrase made obituary dictum in the Svea Court of Appeals decision in this case, and I quote, that the stepfather's conduct, at least in theory, may have constituted an attempted child pornography offense.

<<1252.54;1265.5;en>>
However, this offense was not included in the indictment, and consequently, the Court of Appeal could not assess whether the stepfather could be held liable according to the relevant provision.

<<1265.5;1271.3;en>>
Hence, the stepfather was acquitted, end of quote.

<<1271.3;1285.94;en>>
The government should explain to us what exactly was lacking in the indictment which made it impossible for the Court of Appeal to find the stepfather guilty of this crime.

<<1285.94;1302.78;en>>
Was it simply the fact that the prosecutor had not suggested, alternatively, that this crime might be relevant, or were there other material aspects that were lacking in the indictment?

<<1302.78;1313.3;en>>
Professor Emeritus Madeline Leon-Hubert has, at the applicant's request, submitted a legal opinion on this question.

<<1313.3;1334.94;en>>
Her conclusion is that the film of a 14-year-old girl undressing before taking a shower in an otherwise everyday situation could not by itself be regarded as pornographic within the meaning of the criminal provision concerning child pornography.

<<1334.94;1340.94;en>>
I refer the Court to Professor Leon-Hubert's legal opinion.

<<1340.94;1366.62;en>>
In order for this film, in this case, to become pornographic within the meaning of Chapter 16, Section 10A of the Penal Code, the stepfather would have had to manipulate the film by making it appear that Elisa posed for him voluntarily, or in some other form, put the film in a pornographic context.

<<1366.62;1381.98;en>>
In this case, it was obviously not possible to speculate as to what the stepfather might have done with the film if it hadn't been destroyed.

<<1381.98;1392.5;en>>
For this reason, it was logical that the prosecutor didn't claim that the stepfather's act might be considered an attempted child pornography crime.

<<1392.5;1405.3;en>>
For the same reason, it was logical that Elisa's lawyer didn't either make such a claim, since such a claim would not have had the slightest prospect of success.

<<1405.3;1418.94;en>>
In our view, the discussion regarding an attempted child pornography crime should be dismissed from the agenda in examining the present case, since the government's arguments completely lack substance.

<<1427.2;1451.62;en>>
Possibly realizing that the Court may not be convinced that the stepfather's act in this case could have been prosecuted for the crimes of sexual molestation, molestation, or attempted child pornography, the government suggests that his acts might instead be prosecuted under three other sections of the Swedish Penal Code.

<<1451.62;1461.38;en>>
These other crimes are breach of domiciliary peace, unlawful intrusion, or defamation.

<<1461.38;1472.1;en>>
Generally speaking, the lack of substance in the government's arguments becomes even more obvious concerning these other criminal provisions.

<<1472.1;1486.74;en>>
The Court should note that the government has not in any way tried to explain the contents of, or on what grounds, these additional criminal provisions might apply to the present case.

<<1486.74;1502.78;en>>
In the opinion of the applicant, it ought to be the obligation of the government not to forward speculative or poorly substantiated arguments without any shred of support for its opinion.

<<1502.78;1516.38;en>>
This method has unnecessarily and substantially increased the amount of time spent in responding to these points, especially in our March observations.

<<1516.38;1524.62;en>>
The crimes breach of domiciliary peace or unlawful intrusion are quite simple.

<<1524.62;1534.5;en>>
The first one deals with a person who unlawfully intrudes or remains where another person has his living quarters.

<<1534.5;1547.74;en>>
And the second provision is a person who, without authorization, intrudes or remains in an office, factory, or other building or vessel.

<<1547.74;1564.78;en>>
In the present case, it's obvious that we're not dealing with some kind of an office or a factory or other public or private commercial place, but rather the home of the applicant.

<<1564.78;1572.74;en>>
But the stepfather at this time lived with Elisa and her mother with the consent of the rest of the family.

<<1572.74;1585.72;en>>
Since he was allowed to live in the house where the illicit or covert filming took place, the crime breach of domiciliary peace is not applicable to the present case.

<<1585.72;1594.42;en>>
No one has ever claimed that the stepfather unlawfully intruded or remained in the applicant's and her mother's living quarters.

<<1594.42;1605.46;en>>
It was, of course, not his whereabouts which was the subject of the indictment, but rather his act of covert filming.

<<1605.46;1618.86;en>>
Thus, it's obvious that neither of these invoked provisions are applicable in the present situation, since they don't even fulfill the objective criteria for the crimes.

<<1618.86;1626.86;en>>
The issue concerning whether covert or illicit filming may constitute the crime defamation is quite simple.

<<1626.86;1639.78;en>>
To be a crime, the image, the picture, the photo, the film must be spread to a third party, which is clearly not the issue in the present case.

<<1639.78;1646.62;en>>
Such an indictment in this case would fail immediately on this ground.

<<1646.62;1656.58;en>>
For a more complete discussion about defamation, we again refer to our observations from March of this year.

<<1656.58;1675.7;en>>
Thus, in our opinion, the government has failed to demonstrate that any of the crimes which the government has referred to could have provided Elisa with protection of her right to private life and personal integrity, according to Article 8 of the Convention.

<<1675.7;1687.34;en>>
We spent most of our time demonstrating that there is indeed a flaw in Swedish law regarding the protection of the applicant's rights under Article 8.

<<1687.34;1707.62;en>>
The question is whether this flaw is significant and whether the test of the existence of a significant flaw is the right method when this Court decides whether Sweden has fulfilled its positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention.

<<1707.62;1716.54;en>>
The applicant completely agrees with our learned colleagues from the Human Rights Center of Ghent University in their submissions.

<<1716.54;1722.78;en>>
We especially agree with their definition of positive obligations as twofold.

<<1722.78;1737.58;en>>
States have to develop a regulatory framework containing adequate standards preventing violations of human rights by private actors, if necessary, through criminal provision.

<<1737.58;1740.58;en>>
That is a substantive protection.

<<1740.58;1750.38;en>>
And number two, states have to develop procedures that allow individuals to claim their human rights vis-a-vis other private actors.

<<1750.38;1753.26;en>>
That is procedural protection.

<<1753.26;1768.94;en>>
We also agree that the application of the significant flaws test in the chamber judgment is overly differential and fails to live up to the principles of priority to rights and effectiveness.

<<1768.94;1778.26;en>>
Finally, we would emphasize the importance of their observations regarding the placing of the burden of proof on the parties.

<<1778.26;1788.9;en>>
They point out that the chamber, in their judgment, has placed the burden of proof that there exists a significant flaw on the applicant.

<<1788.9;1800.34;en>>
In their opinion, and in our opinion, the burden of proof that there does not exist a significant flaw should be placed on the state.

<<1800.34;1811.82;en>>
By not doing so, the applicant has been placed in a disadvantaged position, and it creates a presumption that the state has discharged its positive obligation.

<<1811.82;1827.06;en>>
Your Honor, the flaw in Swedish law concerning the protection of personal integrity has been discussed by the Swedish government and parliament since 1966.

<<1827.06;1837.58;en>>
The only result of all these discussions has been one law prohibiting illegal recordings, for instance, wiretapping.

<<1837.58;1846.3;en>>
That is, of sounds and speech, which this law came into effect in 1975.

<<1846.3;1857.34;en>>
There are still no sanctions in Swedish law for the type of covert filming, as in Elisa Söderman's case.

<<1857.34;1867.38;en>>
It's difficult to see that this flaw was less than significant or that Sweden has fulfilled its positive obligations under the convention.

<<1867.38;1871.9;en>>
My colleague, Jan Söderman, will now develop this aspect of the case.

<<1871.9;1871.94;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Josep Casadevall]]

<<1872.44;1875.04;en>>
Thank you, Mr. Lewis, Mr Södergren.

[[Applicant;AP3]]

<<1876.44;1877.8;en>>
Thank you.

<<1877.8;1888.6;en>>
Honorable European judges, learned colleagues, in theory, this court is not required to settle disputes of purely private nature.

<<1888.6;1903.72;en>>
But that being said, this court cannot remain passive where a national court's interpretation of a legal act appears unreasonable, arbitrary, or otherwise inconsistent with the principles underlying the convention.

<<1903.72;1913.08;en>>
This was held in the Swedish Kursid, Mustafa, and Tadzibachi versus Sweden case from 2008 in paragraph 33.

<<1913.08;1923.04;en>>
In effect, this imposes quite far-reaching obligations on the domestic judiciary to protect the rights already national.

<<1923.04;1932.4;en>>
However, the Supreme Court of Sweden does seem to have a little bit different view on this.

<<1932.4;1955.96;en>>
It held in NJA 2007, page 747, that overriding reasons speaks against that a private party may be liable to pay damages due to a violation of Article 8 in situations where such liability does not follow from applicable Swedish tort law, not even through a trioty-conform interpretation.

<<1955.96;1964.84;en>>
Instead, the Supreme Court said that this was a matter for the legislator to handle.

<<1964.84;1966.48;en>>
Sorry.

<<1966.48;1972.72;en>>
It is not uncommon that Swedish courts drops difficult issues in the lap of the legislator.

<<1972.72;1980.84;en>>
Again, we must refer to this case from 2008, NJA 2008, 946.

<<1980.84;1997.64;en>>
Although the Supreme Court noted its concern regarding the total lack of sanctions in the context of Article 8, it went on saying that it must, and I quote, be the task of the legislator to decide whether such criminalization should be adopted, and if so, how it should be changed.

<<2000.64;2005.98;en>>
This constitutes, pure and simple, denidjustice.

<<2005.98;2020.32;en>>
To refer to the legislator issues concerning the already incorporated convention instead of ruling the matter comes at variance with Articles 13 and the subsidiarity and effectiveness principles.

<<2020.32;2047.68;en>>
Well, the government argues that there is no duty for the domestic judiciary, for the national legislator to impose damages with the direct application of Article 8 because there is no duty under the convention to incorporate the convention.

<<2047.68;2052.48;en>>
But this is a huge gap in the line of argumentation by the government.

<<2052.48;2061.0;en>>
What is meant by this is that the incorporation might not be the only method to effectively protect the rights at the national level.

<<2061.0;2068.68;en>>
However, whatever method of incorporation used, the level of protection must, of course, principally be the same.

<<2071.8;2077.84;en>>
The effect of the argumentation by the government leads to a requirement in practice of a double incorporation.

<<2082.08;2095.08;en>>
I mean that in areas where the protection for the rights in the convention in the domestic conditions is insufficient, further domestic legislative measures are still needed according to this approach.

<<2095.08;2103.12;en>>
The incorporated convention is not sufficient, but it has to be followed by domestic legislative measures issue by issue.

<<2103.12;2111.04;en>>
This creates an inertia in the system for the protection of human rights in the national system.

<<2114.4;2118.32;en>>
I must therefore put this question here today to the government.

<<2118.32;2134.76;en>>
Why did we incorporate the convention if the judiciary is not allowed to apply the convention directly, but has to await legislation from the parliament when the domestic law is bad?

<<2134.76;2148.62;en>>
I just want to make clear, we are not arguing that the stepfather in this case should be convicted at the time for a crime with the application of deficient criminal provisions as in the present case.

<<2148.62;2152.6;en>>
That would come into conflict with the sentence nulla poena sine lege.

<<2152.6;2161.24;en>>
However, there is no such thing as non-damnum sine lege principle, at least not in Sweden.

<<2161.24;2169.52;en>>
The sanctioned damages is of course not a punishment, but it's aimed to repair the damages inflicted.

<<2169.52;2183.56;en>>
Furthermore, the Swedish 1972 tort act was the codification of previous case law, and it was held in the preparatory works that the codification should not be prevent further developments in the case law.

<<2187.6;2201.2;en>>
Surely, we can all agree that the imposition of criminal sanctions require much stricter criteria than the imposition of damages aimed at reparation, both according to the convention and Swedish law.

<<2201.2;2218.44;en>>
What has been wrong in the Swedish judiciary regarding the situation at issue is that it seemed to have presupposed a penalty that seemed to have presupposed that damages may not be awarded unless the offender actually was convicted for the criminal act.

<<2218.44;2234.96;en>>
Thereby, the national judiciary has overlooked that the convention is Swedish law by the incorporation act, which the Swedish judges must uphold according to natural law, and in fact have sworn to do in Chapter 7, Section 11 in the Judicial Code.

<<2234.96;2256.3;en>>
Since the compensation for damages flowing for a breach of the convention should, in principle, be available as part of the range of the rodess, the national court should have awarded Elisa Söderman damages imposed on a stepfather, even though he was acquitted from the criminal charge.

<<2256.3;2271.7;en>>
The legal ground for this should have been the incorporation act, in this case Article 8 of the incorporation if the convention could not have been applied directly.

<<2271.7;2289.02;en>>
However, the court of appeal did not, and I'm going back to where I started, that this court cannot remain passive where a national court's interpretation of a legal act appears unreasonable, arbitrary, or otherwise inconsistent with the principle underlying the convention.

<<2289.02;2295.22;en>>
It's in fact a violation of Article 13 in conjunction with Article 8.

<<2295.22;2295.22;en>>
And I thank you.

[[JudgeP;Josep Casadevall]]

<<2296.88;2299.08;en>>
Thank you, Mr. Södergren, Mr. Rönquist.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<2305.39;2309.71;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<2309.71;2325.21;en>>
the present case refers to an attempt by a stepfather to film his 14-year-old stepdaughter, Elisa Södermann, while she was undressing to take a shower in the bathroom of their home.

<<2325.21;2340.19;en>>
The government considers this act to be a breach of the applicant's right to respect for her privacy, a breach that should be regarded as serious, especially considering her young age.

<<2340.19;2350.91;en>>
There is no reason to defend the act of the stepfather, nor are there any countervailing interests that could justify it.

<<2350.91;2359.67;en>>
However, the issue in this case is not whether the stepfather's act was justifiable.

<<2359.67;2372.05;en>>
Instead, the main issue is whether there was sufficient protection in Swedish law against the kind of breaches of integrity that the applicant was subjected to.

<<2372.05;2394.35;en>>
Considering the state's obligations under Article 8 of the Convention and the margin of appreciation afforded for securing the right to respect for private life in the sphere of relations between individuals, the government holds that there was such sufficient protection at the relevant time.

<<2394.35;2405.07;en>>
There were criminal provisions that could apply to the act of the stepfather, and the applicant also had access to a civil law remedy.

<<2405.07;2420.23;en>>
For the sake of clarity, I would initially like to state that the government fully maintains its position as stated in the written memorial submitted to the Grand Chamber on 15 February this year.

<<2420.23;2430.35;en>>
These oral observations will be used to highlight some of the government's arguments that I find particularly relevant to the assessment of the case.

<<2430.35;2443.67;en>>
I will also make a few comments with regard to the additional observations submitted by the applicant and to the third-party intervention made by the Human Rights Centre at Ghent University.

<<2443.67;2445.59;en>>
Mr. President,

<<2445.59;2450.07;en>>
the relevant facts of the case do not seem to be in dispute.

<<2450.07;2468.11;en>>
I do not find it necessary to make any remarks in this regard, nor do I find it necessary to comment on the admissibility of the complaint, as I believe the government's position on this matter is clearly explained in the memorial to the Grand Chamber.

<<2468.11;2483.51;en>>
When it comes to the merits of the case, I note initially that the applicant's complaint under Article 13 was never dealt with by the Chamber, nor has the Grand Chamber posed any questions relating to this issue.

<<2483.51;2493.59;en>>
In this part, I therefore find it sufficient to refer to what the government has submitted in its memorial, paragraphs 40 to 43.

<<2493.59;2502.39;en>>
I will instead focus on the various aspects of Article 8 of the Convention that the present case gives rise to.

<<2502.39;2517.79;en>>
This case concerns Sweden's positive obligations under the Convention to provide sufficient protection against the kind of breaches of integrity that the applicant was subjected to by another individual.

<<2517.79;2526.07;en>>
Initially, I would like to clarify that the government does not question that Article 8 is applicable in the present case.

<<2526.07;2549.03;en>>
However, in the light of the wide margin of appreciation afforded to states in this area, the government is of the opinion that the gravity of the act carried out by the applicant's stepfather is not such that it can be considered that states are required under the Convention to criminalise it.

<<2549.03;2570.27;en>>
In this connection, the government finds it pertinent to point out that the disputed act did not contain any physical element and is therefore not comparable to the very grave acts such as rape, for which the Court has considered criminalisation to be necessary.

<<2570.27;2585.23;en>>
This especially applies since, as concluded by the Court of Appeal, it is unclear whether the act of the stepfather actually resulted in the applicant being filmed.

<<2585.23;2603.03;en>>
Against this background, I would argue that protection against acts such as the one carried out by the stepfather can be afforded not only by way of criminal law protection, but also through civil law remedies.

<<2603.03;2618.11;en>>
It is therefore highly relevant to note that apart from the criminal provisions in Swedish law that could apply to the impound measure of the stepfather, there was also a civil remedy available to the applicant in the present case.

<<2618.11;2624.07;en>>
I will elaborate on this point at a later stage of the presentation.

<<2624.07;2643.71;en>>
When considering the case before us, I find it important to keep in mind the Court's jurisprudence stating that only significant flaws in legislation and practice can amount to a breach of the state's positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention.

<<2643.71;2659.79;en>>
The government finds this standard to be established in the Court's case law through the cases of MC versus Bulgaria, Zeladin versus France, and MNC versus Romania.

<<2659.79;2671.79;en>>
I therefore cannot agree with the contention in the third-party intervention that the chamber judgment elevated this test to a general principle.

<<2671.79;2686.87;en>>
On the contrary, it is the government's view that the chamber was correct in applying what the Jummereiser Institute refers to as the significant flaws test, given the case law I just referred to.

<<2686.87;2697.95;en>>
It should be noted in this connection that the minority of the chamber also appear to be of the view that this test should be applied in this case.

<<2697.95;2711.75;en>>
I refer in this regard to the last paragraph of the dissenting opinion where the minority held that there was a significant omission in Swedish legislation in the present case.

<<2711.75;2724.99;en>>
In the government's view, there are strong reasons to uphold the principle that only significant flaws can amount to a breach of a state's positive obligations.

<<2724.99;2739.39;en>>
This is so since the interest of protecting the rights under Article 8 must be appropriately balanced against other rights under the Convention, such as the freedom of expression.

<<2739.39;2757.07;en>>
Amending national legislation in this area is therefore a sensitive and very complex exercise where a variety of strong and legitimate interests must be taken into account.

<<2757.07;2776.23;en>>
In this connection, it's relevant to note the court's case law stipulating that positive obligations should not be interpreted in a manner which imposes a disproportionate burden on the authorities or the legislator.

<<2776.23;2779.67;en>>
Mr. President, I also find it necessary

<<2779.67;2791.87;en>>
to address some of the comments made by the Jummereiser Institute concerning the general principles of interpretation regarding the positive obligation of states under the Convention.

<<2791.87;2805.63;en>>
The case law referred to by the Institute stating that limitations to Convention rights should be interpreted narrowly is, in my view, not relevant to the present case.

<<2805.63;2831.75;en>>
This is so since this principle has been developed in cases regarding the obligation of states not to introduce arbitrary interferences with the Convention rights, or in other words, the negative undertakings of states, while the present case concerns the scope of Sweden's positive obligations under the Convention.

<<2831.75;2851.03;en>>
For the same reason, I would argue that the court's jurisprudence, according to which respondents states must provide legitimate reasons for interferences with rights under the Convention, does not have a bearing on the present case.

<<2851.03;2862.67;en>>
It appears difficult to apply principles developed with regard to cases concerning negative undertakings of states to cases concerning positive obligations.

<<2862.67;2869.71;en>>
Moreover, it appears there are no examples of this in the court's case law.

<<2869.71;2872.67;en>>
Mr. President, I will now turn to the issue

<<2872.67;2886.35;en>>
of whether the Swedish legislation in force at the material time offered sufficient protection against the kind of breaches of integrity that the applicant was subjected to.

<<2886.35;2899.91;en>>
It is important to stress that covert filming under certain circumstances can constitute a criminal act in Swedish law, although there is no general prohibition against such filming.

<<2899.91;2910.71;en>>
In the present case, the applicant's stepfather was prosecuted for sexual molestation and also convicted for this crime in the district court.

<<2910.71;2924.99;en>>
However, the Court of Appeal conceded that in order to establish criminal liability, the stepfather needed to have had the intent that the filming should come to the attention of the applicant.

<<2924.99;2932.71;en>>
Since it was not possible to establish such intent, the stepfather was acquitted.

<<2932.71;2951.15;en>>
It should be noted that the issue of whether such actions as the one carried out by the stepfather constituted an offence of sexual molestation was not explicitly addressed in the Travå Preparatoriet for the provisions in its wording at the material time.

<<2951.15;2958.03;en>>
Moreover, the stepfather was convicted for this offence in the district court, as I mentioned.

<<2958.03;2977.31;en>>
Accordingly, there was room for different interpretations on whether acts such as the one conducted by the stepfather could constitute sexual molestation.

<<2977.31;2991.11;en>>
The Court of Appeal mentioned in its judgment that the stepfather's filming or attempted filming of the applicant may have constituted a child pornography offence.

<<2991.11;3001.55;en>>
As stated in the government's memorial, it is not possible to conclude why a prosecution was never brought in respect of this offence.

<<3001.55;3021.31;en>>
However, no images were retained from the recording or attempted recording by the stepfather, and needless to say, the prosecutor may under such circumstances find it difficult to prove that an attempted child pornography offence has been committed.

<<3021.31;3036.39;en>>
Against this background, the government maintains that the provision regarding offences of child pornography under certain circumstances can be applicable to acts such as the one carried out in the present case.

<<3036.39;3047.43;en>>
The applicant's assertion in this regard or the legal opinion she has submitted do not give reason to alter this view.

<<3047.43;3058.51;en>>
In the present case, the intention of the stepfather was to film a 14-year-old girl who was undressing in the bathroom in order to take a shower.

<<3058.51;3065.59;en>>
The sole purpose of the act was to stimulate the viewer's sexual fantasies.

<<3065.59;3070.07;en>>
It was done covertly in an intimate place.

<<3070.07;3080.43;en>>
It is therefore not the type of situation which the legislature intended to exclude from the applicability of the crime of child pornography.

<<3080.43;3097.43;en>>
On the contrary, in the Travaux Preparatoire, it is stated that the provision on crimes of child pornography could also apply to the recording of images of children participating in non-sexual situations.

<<3097.43;3112.95;en>>
It may be mentioned in this connection that the government fully recognizes what is put forward in the third-party intervention about the particular importance of protecting minors against sexual abuse.

<<3112.95;3130.43;en>>
Moreover, I believe that the strong interest in doing so is reflected in Swedish legislation inter-related by the provisions on sexual crimes against children and the provision on the crime of child pornography.

<<3130.43;3135.35;en>>
Mr. President, I find it pertinent to draw attention

<<3135.35;3147.71;en>>
to the Chamber's statement that it cannot be concluded that the disputed act of the stepfather was not in theory covered by the Swedish penal code.

<<3147.71;3168.03;en>>
This is so since this statement is questioned by the applicant and in the third-party intervention as being consistent with the principle developed in the court's case law that rights under the convention should be practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and illusory.

<<3168.03;3173.63;en>>
The government does not share this view of the statement in question.

<<3173.63;3197.91;en>>
In my opinion, the statement must be considered a reflection of the fact that even if a certain act falls within the scope of criminal law provisions, it may not always be possible to prosecute or convict the alleged perpetrator of the act, for instance, due to matters of evidence.

<<3197.91;3225.23;en>>
Moreover, as the majority of the Chamber pointed out, the fact that the disputed act of the stepfather could have fallen within the scope of Swedish criminal law makes this case distinct from the cases of X and Y versus the Netherlands and KU versus Finland, where the court concluded that the respondent states had not fulfilled their positive obligations under Article 8.

<<3225.23;3241.71;en>>
In the present case, there were neither any procedural requirements which made it impossible for the applicant to enjoy effective protection of her rights, nor any obstacles to launching an effective investigation.

<<3241.71;3251.83;en>>
It should also be noted in this regard that there will always be room for judicial interpretation, however clearly drafted a provision may be.

<<3251.83;3266.99;en>>
It should also be noted that there is, of course, no requirement under the Convention that a prosecution must result in a conviction.

<<3266.99;3271.63;en>>
Mr. President, in sum, the government maintains

<<3271.63;3288.39;en>>
that at the material time, there were provisions of Swedish criminal law applicable to acts such as the one carried out by the stepfather, notably the provisions regarding sexual molestation and the crime of child pornography.

<<3288.39;3297.95;en>>
Swedish criminal law thus offered protection against the kind of breaches of integrity that the applicant was subjected to.

<<3297.95;3320.03;en>>
In its written submission, the government has referred to the court's case law, stating that because the criminal law is not necessarily the legislature's only way of ensuring respect for private life, hence civil law remedies may also be appropriate for this purpose.

<<3320.03;3329.07;en>>
It is therefore of particular relevance to note that there was a civil remedy available to the applicant in the present case.

<<3329.07;3356.51;en>>
It should be noted in this regard that there was nothing that prevented the applicant from invoking as an alternative ground for damages that the stepfather had acted negligently in respect of her and that he therefore should be liable to compensate her for the psychological injury that she may have sustained as a result of his actions.

<<3356.51;3362.59;en>>
Such a claim could have been granted under Chapter 2, Section 1 of the Tort Liability Act.

<<3362.59;3380.67;en>>
This principle follows from Inter alia, the Supreme Court case referred to as NDA 1990, page 210, where the Supreme Court rejected the claim for damages in a criminal case after having acquitted the defendant.

<<3380.67;3395.27;en>>
However, the Supreme Court also noted that no other grounds for damages except criminal liability had been invoked in support of the claim for damages.

<<3395.27;3410.19;en>>
This demonstrates that under Swedish court law, damages may under certain circumstances be awarded in cases such as the present, even if the defendant is acquitted.

<<3410.19;3419.11;en>>
This is also confirmed by the applicant's submission on 15 February to the Grand Chamber, paragraph 51.

<<3419.11;3431.79;en>>
Under Swedish procedural law, there is a possibility for an agreed person to take action against a suspect of an offence in the form of a private claim.

<<3431.79;3447.27;en>>
It may be noted in this regard that the level of proof required in order to award damages based on such a claim is generally lower than the level of proof required for a conviction for a criminal offence.

<<3447.27;3464.99;en>>
Moreover, in order for a claim of damages to be granted, it is sufficient to demonstrate that the agreed party has suffered an injury due to a negligent act of the perpetrator.

<<3464.99;3473.79;en>>
A private claim may be brought in connection with the prosecution of the offence or in a separate civil proceeding.

<<3473.79;3482.23;en>>
In the present case, the applicant's private claim for damages before the domestic court was joined with the prosecution.

<<3482.23;3491.95;en>>
However, the claim was based merely on the same circumstances as in the prosecution and nothing more.

<<3491.95;3504.79;en>>
This meant that the Court of Appeals' finding with regard to the issue of criminal liability was decisive for its assessment of the private claim.

<<3504.79;3528.11;en>>
The government holds that the applicant could also have invoked that her stepfather had caused her a psychological injury by acting negligently in respect of her and that he should therefore be liable to pay compensation even though no criminal liability had been established.

<<3528.11;3541.27;en>>
As opposed to what the applicant has asserted, the Court of Appeals could not ex officio examine if damages could be awarded on the basis of negligence.

<<3541.27;3552.19;en>>
Thus, since negligence was never invoked, it was not possible for the domestic court to award her damages on this ground.

<<3552.19;3563.47;en>>
These principles are inherent in Swedish procedural law and are explained more comprehensively in the memorial paragraphs 27 to 38.

<<3563.47;3577.83;en>>
Against this background, it cannot be considered that the lack of an award of damages entailed a violation of Article 8.

<<3577.83;3582.75;en>>
Mr. President, the Grand Chamber has also raised the issue

<<3582.75;3596.03;en>>
of whether the absence of a specific provision in Swedish law concerning completed or attempted acts of covert and illicit filming entails a breach of Article 8 of the Convention.

<<3596.03;3607.91;en>>
In this regard, the government notes that it does not follow from the court's case law that states are required to criminalize such acts.

<<3607.91;3616.75;en>>
Moreover, according to the court's case law, states enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in this area.

<<3616.75;3640.27;en>>
In addition, one must have regard to the court's jurisprudence stating that in view of the difficulties involved in policing modern societies, a positive obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose a disproportionate burden on the authorities or the legislator.

<<3640.27;3642.99;en>>
In sum, Mr. President, I do not find support

<<3642.99;3655.79;en>>
in the court's case law for the proposition that the absence of a specific provision regarding covert and illicit filming entails a breach of the Convention.

<<3655.79;3669.43;en>>
Further, when assessing the present case, it is also relevant to consider whether the responsible authorities took appropriate action with regard to the incident that gave rise to it.

<<3669.43;3680.27;en>>
In this connection, it should be noted that the stepfather was prosecuted for his actions and that he was convicted for sexual molestation by the district court.

<<3680.27;3699.31;en>>
The government would also like to draw attention to the applicant's position on this issue, which is that the prosecutor did not fail to conduct an effective prosecution, paragraph 16 to 17, of the applicant's written observation to the Grand Chamber.

<<3699.31;3715.35;en>>
When it comes to the rule of the courts, it may initially be concluded that they were prevented from assessing whether the action of the stepfather constituted an attempted child pornography offense.

<<3715.35;3738.27;en>>
This is so since Swedish procedural law stipulates that courts must not deliver a judgment relating to a criminal act other than the act for which the prosecution has been instituted and the indictment did not cover this offense.

<<3738.27;3753.71;en>>
As regards to the issue of whether the stepfather had committed the offense of sexual molestation, the rule of the courts was to apply the legislation in force at the time of the act for which the stepfather was prosecuted.

<<3753.71;3782.79;en>>
In interpreting the penal provision of sexual molestation, the Court of Appeal was obliged to take also into account other rights under the Convention, including the defendant's rights under Article 7, not to be found guilty of any act that did not constitute a criminal offense in clear and explicit law at the time when it was committed.

<<3782.79;3790.15;en>>
I note that the Chamber also found such considerations to be of relevance to the assessment of the case.

<<3790.15;3800.39;en>>
Against this background, the Court of Appeal's handling of the case cannot be considered to be incompatible with Article 8 of the Convention.

<<3800.39;3804.31;en>>
Mr. President, the government looks seriously

<<3804.31;3812.71;en>>
upon breaches of integrity carried out in the sphere of the relations between individuals themselves.

<<3812.71;3831.51;en>>
Moreover, the government recognizes the importance of measures aimed to prevent such breaches from occurring and to have a system in place which makes it possible to impose sanctions on perpetrators and enables victims to be afforded appropriate redress.

<<3831.51;3842.07;en>>
As described in the memorial, there are ongoing legislative efforts in Sweden that will further strengthen the protection of these interests under Swedish law.

<<3842.07;3852.71;en>>
A bill has been presented to Parliament that criminalizes intrusive photography, i.e. certain acts of filming persons in private situations

<<3852.71;3855.39;en>>
without their permission.

<<3855.39;3872.03;en>>
In my view, when considering the present application, one must have regard to the fact that Sweden has taken these active steps to further enhance protection in Swedish law against the kind of breaches of integrity that the applicant was subjected to.

<<3872.03;3880.11;en>>
It may be noted that the majority of the chamber conceded this to be of relevance to the assessment of the case.

<<3880.11;3884.39;en>>
And I here refer to paragraph 71 of the chamber's judgment.

<<3884.39;3886.59;en>>
In conclusion, Mr. President,

<<3886.59;3898.27;en>>
in light of the arguments presented in writing and before the Grand Chamber today, the government contends that the present case does not reveal any violation of the convention.

<<3898.27;3898.27;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<3924.16;3926.24;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<3926.24;3929.2;en>>
I have two questions.

<<3929.2;3935.0;en>>
And the first question could go to both parties.

<<3935.0;3944.4;en>>
It stems from some of the statements in your both written and oral submissions.

<<3944.4;3984.6;en>>
I would be very happy if you could clarify whether, in your view, a psychological violence was committed by the very fact that the girl, at the time, discovered that her intimate privacy, human dignity, if you will, might have been breached by the stepfather and the actual fact that the camera was found.

<<3984.6;3995.26;en>>
So it's really, I would like your views on whether you consider that was, at that moment, an act of psychological violence.

<<3995.26;4004.7;en>>
And my second question goes more to the government, but if the applicant have something to add, I think that would be appreciated.

<<4004.7;4073.04;en>>
In view of the particular vulnerability of children against all types of violence, and I think we are in the presence not simply of the two private person relationship, but we are in the presence of a child, and the basic principle of human rights law that all decisions and actions of the authorities should have the best interests of the child in mind, could the government point out in what manner were the steps that you have just described, as taken following the complaints from the applicant, effective for the protection of a child, in a sense of both preventing that such acts occur in the future, and in a sense of giving some element of rehabilitation?

<<4073.04;4073.04;en>>
Thank you.

[[Judge;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<4080.35;4082.07;en>>
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

<<4082.07;4084.19;en>>
I have also two questions.

<<4084.19;4088.23;en>>
The first goes to the government.

<<4088.23;4090.79;en>>
Mr. Rönquist, if I got you right,

<<4090.79;4100.59;en>>
you said that the gravity of the act by the stepfather was not such as to create a positive obligation of the state to criminalize it.

<<4100.59;4106.11;en>>
And then you elaborated on the notion of significant flaws.

<<4106.11;4116.99;en>>
May we take it that there was, in fact, a flaw in criminal law at the time of the acts, but that such flaw was not significant according to the government?

<<4116.99;4120.31;en>>
Is this assumption a correct one or not?

<<4120.31;4128.51;en>>
And the second question goes to the applicant, especially to Mr. Lewis.

<<4128.51;4136.99;en>>
Since the time of the acts, there have been legislative changes and proposals for new criminal legislation.

<<4136.99;4144.71;en>>
Do you think that the flaw you have referred to has been covered by legislation actually in force?

<<4144.71;4145.55;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

[[JudgeP;Josep Casadevall]]

<<4146.98;4147.86;en>>
Thank you. Judge Pinto de Albuquerque.

[[Judge;Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque]]

<<4152.07;4153.63;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4153.63;4158.51;en>>
I have two questions to both parties.

<<4158.51;4168.83;en>>
The government argue that the child pornography offense was applicable, at least in theory, to the facts.

<<4168.83;4194.07;en>>
Assuming that this position is correct, why didn't the Court of Appeal use the provision of Chapter 30, Section 3 of the Code of Judicial Procedure and change the legal characterization of the criminal offense into this one?

<<4194.07;4194.83;en>>
First question.

<<4194.83;4196.49;en>>
Second question.

<<4196.49;4218.39;en>>
According to Chapter 22, Section 7 of the Code of Judicial Procedure, the court can award compensation to non-pecuniary damages, even in the case of acquittal of the defendant.

<<4221.47;4233.91;en>>
My question is, why the Court of Appeal did not use these Chapter 22, Section 7 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure?

<<4233.91;4259.71;en>>
And adding to that, if the government accept the view of the Supreme Court that there is no civil liability based directly on the convention, directly on provisions of the convention, when there are no other violations of domestic law?

<<4259.71;4272.71;en>>
And I quote, from the decision of the Supreme Court of October 2007, an individual could not be obliged to compensate another individual directly on the basis of the convention.

<<4272.71;4277.67;en>>
Does the government support this view?

<<4277.67;4292.71;en>>
And as this view, this legal interpretation of national law object to the fulfillment of the positive obligations of the respondent state in this particular case.

<<4292.71;4292.75;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Josep Casadevall]]

<<4294.22;4295.66;en>>
Thank you. Judge Zupančič.

[[Judge;Boštjan M. Zupančič]]

<<4298.44;4300.12;en>>
Thank you Mr. President.

<<4300.12;4302.7;en>>
I have also two questions.

<<4302.7;4317.66;en>>
The first one is sort of in the framework of comparative law because many countries in Central Europe at least and in France as well have something which is called personality rights.

<<4317.66;4324.02;en>>
"Persönlichkeit Richten" in German, "le droit de personalité" in French.

<<4324.02;4346.22;en>>
And by that kind of civil law standard, the right to one's own image would have been the minimum civil law tort claim which had been, the right which had been violated in this kind of situation without regard to any pornography aspect of the story.

<<4346.22;4360.14;en>>
In other words, in some countries, if even in the public you are being photographed without your consent, unless you are a public figure, that might be a problem.

<<4360.14;4372.94;en>>
And you cite of course, von Hanover, second grand chamber judgment in which a similar situation has occurred in this respect.

<<4372.94;4387.62;en>>
And therefore my question is, does Sweden have this kind of personality rights tradition or registration in the context of the traditional tort law?

<<4387.62;4391.26;en>>
My second question to the government is as follows.

<<4391.26;4420.58;en>>
We are here talking about the rights of the applicant, but it is easy to imagine if we turn this situation like a glove inside out, that we might be dealing with a situation in which the perpetrator, the stepfather of the applicant here, would have been the claimant here, would have been the appellant here, applicant here.

<<4420.58;4438.1;en>>
In other words, in that situation, if he had been convicted, he would have asked the reverse question because it would fall under article seven and it would be a question of whether the legality principle was or was not violated in this situation.

<<4438.1;4444.98;en>>
Therefore, I know this is a speculative question, but to me it provides the mirror image of the situation.

<<4444.98;4451.1;en>>
I'd be very grateful if the government could take the position on that kind of a question.

<<4451.1;4451.78;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Josep Casadevall]]

<<4454.0;4463.92;en>>
Well, in order to give the parties enough time to prepare their answers, I suggest to make a 19-minute break.

<<4463.92;4468.3;en>>
That means that at 10.45 we will restart the hearing.

[[Announcer;UNK]]

<<4513.33;4513.91;fr>>
La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Josep Casadevall]]

<<4560.28;4562.88;en>>
The hearing is resumed.

<<4562.88;4566.72;en>>
Each party is allowed for 10 minutes.

<<4566.72;4571.72;en>>
I give the floor, first of all, to, I don't know who wants to take the floor, Mr.

<<4574.56;4576.32;en>>
Mr. Lewis or Mr. Södergren.

<<4576.32;4577.84;en>>
Mr. Södergren.

[[Applicant;AP3]]

<<4581.33;4587.33;en>>
Honorable European judges, we will do our best to answer the questions put to us specifically.

<<4587.33;4593.13;en>>
We are short of time, so I will rush this a bit.

<<4593.13;4604.37;en>>
I would like to address the issue, the question put by Judge Zimmer regarding psychological violence.

<<4604.37;4607.81;en>>
And of course, this was psychological violence.

<<4607.81;4623.61;en>>
It's perhaps not that very common that we are able to express this sort of from the source from the beginning in such court cases as this.

<<4623.61;4633.69;en>>
But we have been talking about this actual hurt in her soul that Elisa actually suffered from this.

<<4633.69;4639.17;en>>
And we've actually been speaking about it in the taxi to this court today.

<<4639.17;4645.93;en>>
She was remitted to psychiatric treatment at the time.

<<4645.93;4656.17;en>>
Also the social welfare were involved in this and said that this is, they had to, they said they had to treat this actually.

<<4656.17;4671.85;en>>
So it's no doubt that both as per definition and in practice, this was psychological violence for which there was no remedy in the domestic system.

<<4671.85;4675.37;en>>
And I will leave the next question to you, to Mr. Lewis.

<<4675.37;4676.37;en>>
No, no, sorry, to Mr. Clowns-Crawford.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<4682.1;4687.34;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4687.34;4696.94;en>>
Yes, and I will answer the question from Judge Sicilianos regarding the new legislation in Sweden.

<<4696.94;4703.1;en>>
Let me first stress that there is still no new legislation covering these matters.

<<4703.1;4708.26;en>>
However, there is a proposal about this.

<<4708.26;4721.26;en>>
And I think it's interesting to comment on this also since the government asked the Grand Chamber to take this proposal into consideration.

<<4721.26;4730.62;en>>
And let me first say that it is still not clear whether or not this proposal will pass.

<<4730.62;4738.1;en>>
The government presented the proposal in February and it's set to be voted for in May.

<<4738.1;4742.1;en>>
And let me just take some examples.

<<4742.1;4752.82;en>>
One demand from the Green Party is requiring a five-year limit in this proposal if it follows the new legislation.

<<4752.82;4759.78;en>>
And there are also other initiatives in the Swedish Parliament with criticism against the proposal.

<<4759.78;4766.54;en>>
And as we mentioned before, there is no majority for this proposal for the government.

<<4766.54;4782.58;en>>
But it's also interesting to note that this proposal is for the time being a target for an aggressive campaign from different interest groups.

<<4782.58;4788.62;en>>
There has been criticism from consultation bodies during the whole process, actually.

<<4788.62;4791.02;en>>
And let me give two examples.

<<4791.02;4810.82;en>>
There is an interest organization for Swedish publishers that recently informed in one of Sweden's most influential newspapers, Dagens Nyheter, that they demanded this proposal to be struck out of the list.

<<4810.82;4828.18;en>>
There is also a very effective work from the Swedish Union of Journalists that recently sent letters expressing their concern to all members of the Committee on Justice as well as all members of the Committee on the Constitution with exactly the same demand.

<<4828.18;4833.86;en>>
They demanded this proposal to be struck.

<<4833.86;4842.3;en>>
And this is also interesting in the perspective of what the chamber took into consideration.

<<4842.3;4848.66;en>>
They did, as the government suggests, that the Grand Chamber should do in this case.

<<4848.66;4863.14;en>>
The chamber took into consideration the government's claim that this proposal in its initial version to create this new legislation.

<<4863.14;4865.5;en>>
But what happened with that?

<<4865.5;4866.9;en>>
Actually, the same thing.

<<4866.9;4874.66;en>>
It was also criticized by different interest groups, the same as I mentioned, amongst others.

<<4874.66;4879.5;en>>
And it was also criticized by the Swedish Law Council.

<<4879.5;4880.5;en>>
And what happened?

<<4880.5;4883.74;en>>
Well, it never passed in the parliament.

<<4883.74;4893.58;en>>
So when the government asked you to take into consideration that there is a proposal now for new legislation, there are a lot of question marks, which makes that request not so important, actually.

[[JudgeP;Josep Casadevall]]

<<4904.88;4905.0;en>>
Thank you.

[[Applicant;AP4]]

<<4908.23;4915.11;en>>
Your Honor, I would just like to address, well, two questions connected.

<<4915.11;4918.99;en>>
One of them was really directed at the government.

<<4918.99;4941.63;en>>
And that was, if the gravity of this particular action was not so great that it required criminalization, does that mean that there was a flaw in criminal law?

<<4941.63;4946.47;en>>
Obviously, from everything we said earlier, we have pointed out that there is such a flaw and so on.

<<4946.47;4954.11;en>>
But we would also like to make the point, leading up to the next question, that we don't say that it must be criminalized.

<<4954.11;4957.11;en>>
We have never claimed that in this case.

<<4957.11;4962.95;en>>
We have our own personal opinion that there's important reasons to criminalize it.

<<4962.95;4970.11;en>>
And apparently, the government also agrees with us on this point, since they made the proposal that they made to the Parliament.

<<4970.11;4974.55;en>>
But nevertheless, the necessity is that there is an effective remedy.

<<4974.55;4977.87;en>>
And we say that there still has not been an effective remedy.

<<4977.87;4983.63;en>>
Which leads to the other question, which I believe was partially addressed to me.

<<4983.63;4995.23;en>>
And that is, wasn't it possible for the Svea Court of Appeal to grant damages in spite of the fact that the stepfather was acquitted?

<<4995.23;5004.39;en>>
And we have tried to explain that, in our opinion, we thought that that could have been possible and should have been possible.

<<5004.39;5009.07;en>>
However, the result of the case is that it wasn't possible.

<<5011.87;5026.03;en>>
I would refer you to the — there's an appendix which we have submitted to the district court decision, in which you can see exactly what Elisa's attorney did in this case.

<<5029.47;5036.35;en>>
The attorney never said that it was due to the criminalization of this act.

<<5036.35;5048.83;en>>
They simply — the attorney said that this act, the indictment, was the ground for causing Elisa injury.

<<5048.83;5049.79;en>>
And you can read that.

<<5049.79;5051.59;en>>
That's exactly what he said.

<<5051.59;5063.91;en>>
And he describes the injury as being, on the one hand, a violation of her personal integrity, which is part of the psychological violence.

<<5063.91;5067.55;en>>
And the second was her pain and suffering.

<<5067.55;5072.35;en>>
And these are clearly concepts within the law of torts.

<<5072.35;5084.03;en>>
And we claim that we think it would have been possible, without even using a conventional conform interpretation of the law of torts, to have given it.

<<5084.03;5086.71;en>>
But this did not happen.

<<5086.71;5090.43;en>>
And this doesn't happen in lots of cases like this.

<<5090.43;5107.43;en>>
There's some kind of interpretation from the Swedish courts today which generally think that when you have joined a claim of damages to the criminal indictment, that if the criminal indictment falls, that there can be no damages.

<<5107.43;5116.59;en>>
And that, in spite of what is written in the Procedural Code, 22nd Chapter, 7th paragraph.

<<5116.59;5120.75;en>>
So our answer is we think it should have, could have, but it didn't.

<<5120.75;5129.99;en>>
And the fact that it didn't shows that there is not either a civil remedy for Elisa in this concrete case.

<<5129.99;5129.99;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Josep Casadevall]]

<<5134.19;5137.11;en>>
Thank you very much. I call Mr. Rönquist.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<5142.98;5149.94;en>>
Mr. President, let me first refer to the question put by Judge Simmele.

<<5149.94;5169.38;en>>
As was in fact established by the Court of Appeal, it was clear from the evidences in the case that the applicant had suffered psychological injury due to her stepfather's actions.

<<5169.38;5172.54;en>>
And the government shares this view.

[[JudgeP;Josep Casadevall]]

<<5620.56;5623.52;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<5623.52;5626.48;en>>

<<5626.48;5633.36;en>>
I thank the parties for their interventions and answers to the core questions.

<<5633.36;5636.76;en>>
The core will now deliberate on the merits.

<<5636.76;5639.72;en>>
The judgment will be delivered later.

<<5639.72;5643.08;en>>
The parties will be informed of the date of the delivery.

<<5643.08;5643.08;en>>
I declare the hearing closed.

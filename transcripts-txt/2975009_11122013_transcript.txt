La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<51.39;52.15;en>>
Please be seated.

<<60.19;71.07;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the admissibility and merits in the case of Hassan against the United Kingdom.

<<71.07;82.15;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on the 5th of June, 2009, under Article 34 of the Convention by an Iraqi national, Mr. Khadim Resaan Hassan.

<<82.15;91.55;en>>
The application was allocated to the Grand Chamber of the Court pursuant to Rule 52, paragraph 1 of the Rules of the Court.

<<91.55;98.67;en>>
The application was communicated to the government on the 30th of August, 2011.

<<98.67;109.03;en>>
On the 4th of June, 2013, the chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction in favor of the Grand Chamber.

<<109.03;126.15;en>>
On the 26th of August, 2013, the president of the Grand Chamber granted leave to the Human Rights Center of the University of Essex to submit written comments as a third party by virtue of Rule 44, paragraph 3 of the Rules of Court.

<<126.15;133.31;en>>
The government are represented by their agent, Ms. Tomlinson, assisted by Mr. Eadie QC. and Mr. Staker

<<133.31;138.11;en>>
Council, and by Mr. Addison and Ms. McLeod Advisor.

<<138.11;142.69;en>>
The applicant is represented by Mr. Otty QC and Mr. Cleaver

<<142.69;146.15;en>>
Council, assisted by Mr. Shiner, Ms. B. Shiner,

<<146.15;148.91;en>>
and Ms. L. Shiner Advisors.

<<148.91;153.79;en>>
I welcome the representatives in the name of the court.

<<153.79;167.15;en>>
I would also like to welcome a delegation of judges of the Supreme Court of Montenegro, judges from the Supreme Court of Justice of Moldova, judges from the Supreme Court of Poland.

<<167.15;178.63;en>>
I also welcome the visiting groups of judges and other dignitaries from Georgia, Latvia, Russia, Turkey, Japan, and Korea.

<<178.63;199.19;en>>
I would explain that in addition to interpreting in the two official languages of the court, English and French, interpreting into Russian and Turkish has been authorized for the benefit of a delegation of Russian judges and a delegation from the Turkish High Council of Judges and Prosecutors.

<<199.19;210.41;en>>
That interpreting is not arranged by the court, and no transcription of the oral translation will be included in the official record of the proceedings.

<<210.41;221.31;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and the representative of the applicant, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<221.31;225.03;en>>
Mr. Eadie for the government will speak first,

<<225.03;228.27;en>>
and then Mr. Otty for the applicant.

<<228.27;229.53;en>>
I call Mr. Eadie.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<232.04;241.84;en>>
Members of the court, if I wasn't nervous before, the list of dignitaries that you just read out would be more than sufficient to make me very nervous now.

<<241.84;244.8;en>>
We are in Iraq.

<<244.8;255.72;en>>
The relevant dates are late April and early May 2003, the core focus being between the 23rd of April and the 2nd of May 2003.

<<255.72;262.19;en>>
So that period is almost entirely within the active hostilities phase of the armed conflict.

<<262.19;268.1;en>>
It is not in dispute that that armed conflict was an international armed conflict.

<<268.1;272.6;en>>
It had commenced on the 20th of March 2003.

<<272.6;284.48;en>>
As the Grand Chamber noted in Al-Skaini at paragraph 10 and Al-Jadda at paragraph 26, British forces had captured Basra by the 5th of April 2003.

<<284.48;291.16;en>>
United States troops had gained control of Baghdad by the 9th of April 2003.

<<291.16;298.6;en>>
And major combat operations were declared complete on the 1st of May 2003.

<<298.6;316.72;en>>
From that date, as the Grand Chamber also specifically found in Al-Skaini at paragraph 143 and Al-Jadda at paragraph 77, the US and the UK became occupying powers within the meaning of article 42 of the Hague regulations.

<<316.72;331.01;en>>
Unsurprisingly, therefore, the Grand Chamber in Al-Skaini and Al-Jadda has already applied the 1st of May 2003 as the key date in terms of major combat operations in Iraq coming to an end.

<<331.01;334.39;en>>
That was also the conclusion of the court in Al-Sadun.

<<334.39;338.0;en>>
See paragraph 3 of that decision.

<<338.0;350.12;en>>
It appears that the applicant takes issue with this finding, asserting an earlier date for the end of active hostilities at some point in early April 2003.

<<350.12;353.96;en>>
We submit that there is no basis for doing so.

<<353.96;364.96;en>>
And we've set out our case in detail on that point in our additional observations of the 14th of October 2013 between paragraphs 21 and 31.

<<364.96;371.88;en>>
The issue has been dealt with correctly, as we submit, by the Grand Chamber in Al-Skaini and Al-Jadda.

<<371.88;379.84;en>>
The documents relied upon by the applicant simply do not support his proposition of an earlier end to that active hostilities phase.

<<379.84;386.15;en>>
No doubt, certain major objectives have been achieved earlier in April 2003.

<<386.15;393.07;en>>
But the documents also plainly indicate the fact of serious, ongoing fighting.

<<393.07;410.72;en>>
There is nothing whatever to support a suggestion, which would have to be made by the applicant, that for some unspecified reason, the UK and the USA delayed the declaration of completion of major combat operations for one, two, or even three weeks.

<<410.72;416.32;en>>
This case concerns a man called Tariq Hassan.

<<416.32;425.62;en>>
Early in the morning of the 23rd of April 2003, a military operation was carried out by British forces in Basra.

<<425.62;436.12;en>>
The aim of that operation was to capture a general in the Al-Quds Army, that is, in the army against which the coalition forces were fighting.

<<436.12;440.75;en>>
He was thus a combatant and a legitimate military target.

<<440.75;445.68;en>>
That general is now the applicant before this court.

<<445.68;449.6;en>>
The British forces went to an address believed to be the general's house.

<<449.6;451.75;en>>
They did not find him.

<<451.75;454.39;en>>
It appears that he had already left.

<<454.39;462.44;en>>
But they did find an adult male on the roof of the house with a Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle.

<<462.44;479.12;en>>
The fact that many Iraqis might lawfully have carried AK-47s does not mean that the UK forces should have assumed, still less were required to assume, that this individual was lawfully doing so, especially when he had the assault rifle on the roof of the house.

<<479.12;484.18;en>>
And that house was the house of a general in the Al-Quds Army.

<<484.18;494.03;en>>
The key contemporaneous record at GA3, therefore, and we say with good reason, described this individual as, and I quote, a gunman.

<<494.03;497.27;en>>
That is the word used in the record.

<<497.27;504.6;en>>
On being questioned, the individual admitted that he was the brother of the man being sought, that is, of the applicant.

<<504.6;510.56;en>>
According to the applicant's own statements, the soldiers found further firearms in the house.

<<510.56;515.96;en>>
They also, having searched the house, found valuable intelligence material.

<<515.96;521.8;en>>
In those circumstances, and entirely unsurprisingly, the individual was captured.

<<521.8;524.44;en>>
That occurred at about 6.30 in the morning

<<524.44;527.84;en>>
on the 23rd of April, 2003.

<<527.84;532.25;en>>
The individual was Tariq Hassan.

<<532.25;535.08;en>>
Two things are clear, and I will need to return to them.

<<535.08;548.08;en>>
It is clear first that the UK was entitled in international law to detain combatants as prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva Convention Number Three.

<<548.08;557.39;en>>
The circumstances of Tariq Hassan's capture more than justified detaining him on the basis that he was a suspected combatant.

<<557.39;567.2;en>>
The soldiers on the ground were unsurprisingly not well equipped, and indeed not even authorized to make any final decisions about his status.

<<567.2;573.27;en>>
So he was taken to Camp Bucca, B-U-C-C-A, for that to be done.

<<573.27;576.75;en>>
He was interviewed within two hours of his arrival at the camp.

<<576.75;580.13;en>>
The view was reached that he was probably a civilian.

<<580.13;586.96;en>>
He was interviewed again some 36 hours later on the morning of the 25th of April, 2003.

<<586.96;597.6;en>>
The view about his civilian status was confirmed, and it was additionally concluded that there was no reason to suspect that he was a security risk or a suspected criminal.

<<597.6;602.56;en>>
The decision was therefore taken at that point to release him.

<<602.56;605.12;en>>
I pause there to deal with two things.

<<605.12;613.91;en>>
The first is a suggestion that Tariq Hassan was detained in order to put pressure on the applicant to surrender himself.

<<613.91;617.63;en>>
That suggestion is entirely without foundation.

<<617.63;621.44;en>>
There is nothing in the records that have been discovered to support it.

<<621.44;631.48;en>>
It is undermined by the fact that there were entirely proper and reasonable grounds on which to capture him, not least the fact that he was a gunman at the general's house.

<<631.48;650.92;en>>
As importantly, that suggestion is impossible to reconcile with the fact, which is clearly and unequivocally recorded in the contemporaneous documentation, the fact that a decision was taken to release Tariq Hassan less than 38 hours after his arrival at Camp Bucca.

<<650.92;657.36;en>>
The second matter to deal with is the complaints the applicant makes about recently discovered documentation.

<<657.36;662.6;en>>
We can no doubt all agree that it is unfortunate that it was not discovered earlier.

<<662.6;673.39;en>>
That is for the simple reason that the documentation now provides a much clearer picture, based on the contemporaneous records, of the circumstances of the capture of Tariq Hassan.

<<673.39;679.68;en>>
But we do not accept the criticism now made by the applicant about the late appearance of this material.

<<679.68;688.6;en>>
It is easy in retrospect to assert that further electronic searches could have been made, which would have led to the earlier discovery of the documentation.

<<688.6;693.63;en>>
However, reasonable searches were made electronically in reasonable places.

<<693.63;698.63;en>>
See paragraph 7 of our observations for a description of what was undertaken.

<<698.63;715.5;en>>
And it is unattractive indeed for too strident a criticism to be made in this case, in circumstances in which the applicant himself, for whatever unverifiable reason, delayed for a period of three years before even raising the matter with the British authorities.

<<715.5;730.39;en>>
You have the citation of the Van Aver case, at paragraph 161 to 2, at paragraph 22 of our observations, for the importance the court attaches to the need to make timely complaints.

<<730.39;739.39;en>>
However, the point of real significance here is that the complaints about late discovery of material do not advance the applicant's substantive case at all.

<<739.39;750.84;en>>
They do not do so because he cannot properly, and does not seek, positively to suggest that the documentation now discovered is anything other than genuine and contemporaneous.

<<750.84;763.63;en>>
And once that is accepted, the documentation stands as highly relevant to, indeed, the best contemporaneous evidence of the circumstances of Tariq Hassan's capture.

<<763.63;765.88;en>>
Back to the facts.

<<765.88;775.6;en>>
Following the determination of his status on the 25th of April 2003, he was released to the civilian holding area at Camp Bucca.

<<775.6;791.34;en>>
He could not be released immediately because Iraq at that time was a dangerous place, and a military order provided for what it described as, and I quote, a secure, efficient, and humane system for release.

<<791.34;799.44;en>>
Before coming to that release, I can dispose of any suggestion of ill treatment, contrary to Article 3, briefly.

<<799.44;804.08;en>>
Again, there is nothing to support any ill treatment having occurred.

<<804.08;809.28;en>>
Nothing in the documentation, medical or otherwise, suggests it.

<<809.28;814.08;en>>
No possible reason for ill treatment has been advanced.

<<814.08;822.51;en>>
He was shortly questioned twice, the view being formed very early on that he was a civilian and not a threat.

<<822.51;829.12;en>>
Moreover, the evidence the applicant has advanced himself from Mr. Al-Sadun, the same Al-Sadun

<<829.12;838.55;en>>
whose case you heard some years ago, who was also in the camp at the time, positively supports the fact that no such ill treatment occurred.

<<838.55;841.48;en>>
Had there been ill treatment, Mr. Al-Sadun

<<841.48;850.55;en>>
would no doubt have been the first to say so, or to say that Tariq Hassan had even told him about such ill treatment of himself.

<<850.56;854.8;en>>
There is nothing to that effect even alleged.

<<854.8;856.56;en>>
His release.

<<856.56;863.76;en>>
It is clear from the records that Tariq Hassan was released in May 2003.

<<863.76;868.98;en>>
The most likely date is the 2nd of May 2003.

<<868.98;876.84;en>>
He returned by escorted coach to the place of his capture, either Umm Qasr or Basra.

<<876.84;884.76;en>>
What happened after his release is not known, and given the fact of release, could not be known to the government.

<<884.76;887.8;en>>
However, the following facts do appear.

<<887.8;894.84;en>>
They lead to the clearest conclusion that his death was not at the hands of British forces.

<<894.84;907.7;en>>
There is nothing whatever to link what happened to Tariq Hassan after he was released from Camp Bukha in May 2003 to the acts of the UK or its armed forces.

<<907.7;913.8;en>>
His body was found some four months after his release.

<<913.8;923.96;en>>
The only possible inference from the fact of the discovery of his body at this time is that he was in fact killed at or shortly before that discovery of the body.

<<923.96;931.4;en>>
The date of death, according to the death certificate, is the 1st of September 2003.

<<931.4;939.03;en>>
His body was found in Samarra, some 600 kilometers away from Camp Bukha and Umm Qasr.

<<939.03;946.12;en>>
It was found in an area that was not and had never been occupied by British forces.

<<946.12;950.15;en>>
It is said that he was killed by a Kalashnikov.

<<950.15;954.39;en>>
That is not a weapon used by British forces.

<<954.39;966.13;en>>
And finally, any theory that British forces had anything to do with his death thus has to be built around a prior claim that he was not in fact released in May 2003.

<<966.13;983.05;en>>
Such a claim would be impossible to reconcile with multiple contemporaneous records showing that Tariq Hassan was quickly determined to be a civilian who did not pose a security threat and was then released in May 2003.

<<983.05;988.79;en>>
There is thus no case on Article 2 on those facts.

<<988.79;1013.16;en>>
This is on no viewer case, such as posited in Van Aver Paragraph 184, where a particular burden shifts to the respondent state because a person has been found injured or dead or has disappeared in an area within the exclusive control of the authorities of that state, and there is prima facie evidence that the state at least may be involved.

<<1013.16;1026.23;en>>
This is also not a case like Velikova or other cases relied upon by the applicant where the applicant's injury or death indisputably occurred whilst in the custody of the contracting state's authorities.

<<1026.23;1032.17;en>>
Records clearly show that Tariq Hassan was released from custody.

<<1032.17;1040.45;en>>
It is equally clear for the reasons I've just given that he wasn't killed by British forces or even in an area controlled by UK authorities.

<<1040.45;1047.58;en>>
He was killed by persons unknown four months after release, some 600 kilometers away.

<<1047.58;1050.45;en>>
There is therefore nothing to investigate.

<<1050.45;1056.08;en>>
There is no arguable basis even for linking his death to the United Kingdom.

<<1056.08;1074.93;en>>
I make the submission of principle that in a case such as this, the existence of an arguable case that in some way the state concerned acted incompatibly with the substantive provisions of Article 2 is and properly in principle should be a precondition to any duty to investigate arising.

<<1074.93;1079.63;en>>
No such arguable case is close to being made out.

<<1079.63;1091.88;en>>
In any event, the records discovered since the matter was raised over three years after the death itself, as I indicated, show with clarity the essential elements of what happened.

<<1091.88;1096.23;en>>
In truth, this is a claim about Article 5 or nothing.

<<1096.23;1102.51;en>>
But before coming to Article 5, I want to deal very briefly, if I may, with jurisdiction.

<<1102.51;1115.36;en>>
It is, of course, well established that jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention is generally territorial in nature and that extraterritorial jurisdiction is exceptional.

<<1115.36;1128.23;en>>
It is to be emphasized that this case is different from previous cases in which the court has found exceptionally extraterritorial jurisdiction to exist in the context of armed conflict.

<<1128.23;1149.23;en>>
In Al-Skhaini and in Al-Jadda, the relevant events took place after the end of the active hostilities phase of the armed conflict on the 1st of May, 2003, at a time when the United Kingdom had become an occupying power within the meaning of Article 42 of the Hague Regulations.

<<1149.23;1161.67;en>>
And the UK was found, as you will recall, to have assumed authority and responsibility for the maintenance of security in that area of Iraq which it controlled, Southeast Iraq.

<<1161.67;1173.28;en>>
Cases such as Loizidou and Van Aver concern the extraterritorial acts of a contracting state within the territory of another contracting state, so different for that reason.

<<1173.28;1185.52;en>>
And the case is also different to those mentioned at paragraph 164 of Al-Skhaini, which again concerned events on a contracting state's own territory.

<<1185.52;1212.56;en>>
The government's submission of general principle is that where new sets of circumstances are argued to bring a person within the jurisdiction of a contracting state, the court should act in accordance with the base principles that it has consistently acknowledged, chief amongst them that jurisdiction in relation to extraterritorial acts is truly exceptional.

<<1212.56;1222.88;en>>
That as Bankovic noted, it is not appropriate to treat the foundational concept of jurisdiction as part of the living instrument doctrine.

<<1222.88;1238.36;en>>
That in consequence of both of these principles, there is no scope for the incremental development of the very concept of jurisdiction, or at the very least, that any such development should be approached with the utmost caution.

<<1238.36;1251.32;en>>
Still at the level of general principle, we have set out in some detail in our observations, paragraphs 65 to 75, our understanding of the court's reasoning in Al-Skhaini.

<<1251.32;1257.08;en>>
Of course, we say the situation in this case is different to that in Al-Skhaini for the reasons I've given.

<<1257.08;1270.32;en>>
However, given the importance of the principles governing jurisdiction to other cases, we do invite the court to agree in its judgment with that understanding of the reasoning of the court in Al-Skhaini.

<<1270.32;1273.27;en>>
What then of Tariq Hassan?

<<1273.27;1286.91;en>>
At the point of his capture, as I readily acknowledge, it can be argued that he was under the full and exclusive control principle articulated by the court at paragraph 136 of Al-Skhaini.

<<1286.91;1293.59;en>>
But even at that point, my submission is that he should not be held to fall within the UK's jurisdiction.

<<1293.59;1307.56;en>>
My submission is that the full and exclusive control exception should not apply in the active hostilities phase of an international armed conflict like this one, taking place outside the territory of any contracting state.

<<1307.56;1314.71;en>>
And that is because the convention was simply not designed to regulate the conduct of states in such a situation.

<<1314.71;1321.84;en>>
International humanitarian law applies, as it has been specifically designed to do.

<<1321.84;1333.59;en>>
And none of the other exceptional situations of extraterritorial jurisdiction referred to at paragraphs 134 to 142 of Al-Skhaini are of any potential application in this case.

<<1333.59;1349.89;en>>
To take but one example, in Al-Skhaini itself at paragraphs 149 to 150, the effective control of an area exception was found not to apply, even in relation to events after the 1st of May 2003.

<<1349.89;1358.15;en>>
That is, in the later stage, by which point the UK had become a Hague regulation state.

<<1358.15;1359.71;en>>
So that's the point of his capture.

<<1359.71;1366.71;en>>
Whilst at Camp Booker, Tariq Hassan was for a separate reason outside the jurisdiction of the UK.

<<1366.71;1376.55;en>>
Camp Booker was a United States-run facility, as was recognized by the fourth section in the Al-Sadun case at paragraph 41.

<<1376.55;1398.73;en>>
In Al-Skhaini at paragraph 136, the Grand Chamber noted that in Al-Sadun, the court held that two Iraqi nationals detained in British-controlled military prisons in Iraq did fall within the jurisdiction of the UK, since the UK exercised, as it was put, total and exclusive control over the prisons and the individuals detained in them.

<<1398.73;1406.23;en>>
Clearly, the UK did not exercise total and exclusive control whilst they were in Camp Booker.

<<1406.23;1421.11;en>>
Similarly, in Hurst-Jammer at paragraph 81, the Grand Chamber spoke of a situation where the applicants were under the continuous and exclusive de jure and de facto control of the Italian authorities.

<<1421.11;1445.95;en>>
Even if it were argued that Tariq Hassan was under some kind of joint UK or US control while at Camp Booker, it is submitted that the UK's participation with a non-contracting state in a joint authority responsible for the administration of a place of detention outside the territory of any contracting state does not place persons in that facility within the jurisdiction of the UK.

<<1445.95;1460.07;en>>
For the purposes of the principle described at 136 of Al-Skaini, a contracting state in such a case cannot have full and exclusive control over an individual detained by such joint authority.

<<1460.07;1469.19;en>>
The position is not changed because the memorandum of arrangement between the UK and the US on which the applicant has relied.

<<1469.19;1484.99;en>>
The memorandum of arrangement is consistent with Article 12 GC3, the Third Geneva Convention, which expressly provides for the transfer of prisoners of war by the detaining power to another power which is a party to that convention.

<<1484.99;1499.51;en>>
The second sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 12 makes clear that upon such transfer, and I quote, responsibility for the application of the convention rests on the power accepting them while they are in its custody.

<<1499.51;1513.83;en>>
It therefore specifically envisages, in effect, a transfer of responsibility so that if the capturing state affects such a transfer, the capturing state no longer has jurisdiction in the Article 1 sense.

<<1513.83;1523.79;en>>
It is immaterial that under paragraph 4 of the memorandum, the UK could have requested the return of Tariq Hassan to its custody from the US.

<<1523.79;1525.55;en>>
The same point applies.

<<1525.55;1543.75;en>>
The fact that such a requesting mechanism is in place strongly supports the proposition that it was the state holding the person, here the US, that exercised jurisdiction in the Article 1 sense unless and until that state returned the person to the capturing state.

<<1543.75;1550.91;en>>
The UK never made such a request in relation to Tariq Hassan and had no reason to do so.

<<1550.91;1559.47;en>>
Finally, UK troops were responsible for Tariq Hassan's transport from Camp Bucca back to his place of capture.

<<1559.47;1564.67;en>>
However, during that short period, he was in no sense within the jurisdiction of the UK.

<<1564.67;1575.43;en>>
He had become a free man merely being provided with transport arranged by UK forces to ensure that he reached his destination safely.

<<1575.43;1599.99;en>>
Article 5, then, the principal issue of substantive law raised by the facts of this case is whether the detention of a prisoner of war in accordance with GC3 would be contrary to Article 5 of the ECHR unless all of the substantive and procedural requirements of Article 5 are somehow complied with.

<<1599.99;1617.83;en>>
My submission to the court is that where a person is detained as an actual or presumed prisoner of war under the terms of GC3 in the active phase of hostilities, that detention is not contrary to Article 5.

<<1617.84;1620.19;en>>
Three short points on that.

<<1620.19;1633.84;en>>
First, the applicable safeguards governing all relevant aspects of detention are expressly regulated in detail by international humanitarian law, the Geneva Conventions.

<<1633.84;1640.41;en>>
That is the body of international law designed to deal with detention in such a situation.

<<1640.41;1653.84;en>>
Given that design, it is unsurprising that the safeguards afforded to the detainee by the Geneva Conventions are entirely sufficient to provide appropriate protection.

<<1653.84;1662.08;en>>
Not merely that, but those safeguards are specifically tailored to the situation they are designed to cover.

<<1662.08;1676.95;en>>
There is no need for the ECHR guarantees designed to cover detention in peace and not war, in summary, to step in to fill what might otherwise be perceived as a human rights deficit.

<<1676.95;1681.95;en>>
The Geneva Conventions are a true lex specialis.

<<1681.95;1693.34;en>>
Inherent, of course, in that very description is an assertion of the preference in principle for one particular system of law over another.

<<1693.34;1706.36;en>>
The preference here flows not just from the sufficient and tailored nature of the Geneva Conventions as the appropriate preferable system for regulating detention in such cases.

<<1706.36;1720.89;en>>
It also flows from what we submit is the inherent unsuitability of Article 5, or at least Article 5 without significant modification, as the regulatory system here.

<<1720.89;1741.67;en>>
To take but one example, an example which, as you will recall, much troubled our House of Lords in the Al-Jadda case, the categories of case listed in Article 5, paragraph 1 purport to be exhaustive as to the circumstances in which detention can occur compatibly with that article.

<<1741.67;1746.59;en>>
There is no category for combatants or suspected combatants.

<<1746.59;1756.35;en>>
It may, of course, be possible in some cases to stretch the existing categories to include all of those who could lawfully be detained under the Geneva Conventions.

<<1756.35;1760.59;en>>
But that is very far from obvious or easy.

<<1760.59;1773.15;en>>
And to the extent that that cannot be done to cover all cases where capture is specifically permitted by the Geneva Conventions, there would be absurdity or worse.

<<1773.15;1786.03;en>>
A state engaged in the active phase of an international armed conflict could kill an enemy combatant, but not, because of the operation of Article 5, capture and detain him.

<<1786.03;1794.12;en>>
That simply cannot, we respectfully submit, be a principled place for this court's jurisprudence to end up.

<<1794.12;1796.33;en>>
That's the first short point.

<<1796.33;1813.55;en>>
Secondly, such a conclusion is powerfully supported by the court's consistent approach of interpreting the convention itself in harmony with other rules of international law, and specifically with international humanitarian law.

<<1813.55;1821.27;en>>
See, for example, the Varnava case at paragraph 185 in the context of Article 2.

<<1821.27;1834.35;en>>
The superimposition of Article 5 on top of the Geneva Conventions on no view simply adds an additional and thus attractive layer of human rights protection.

<<1834.35;1838.67;en>>
The two systems simply do not fit in this context and for this purpose.

<<1838.67;1841.71;en>>
They simply don't fit naturally together.

<<1841.71;1849.03;en>>
And they do not do so for the simple reason that only one of them is designed to meet the context that we are considering.

<<1849.03;1852.07;en>>
That is the Geneva Conventions.

<<1852.07;1862.15;en>>
Thirdly, the approach is supported by the reasoning of the ICJ and by authoritative commentators, as we've set out in our observations at paragraph 107.

<<1862.15;1864.67;en>>
So we make alternative submissions.

<<1864.67;1874.83;en>>
Our primary case is that the Geneva Conventions are the lex specialis, and as such, displace Article 5 in the present context.

<<1874.83;1890.19;en>>
Our alternative case, and it is very much an alternative for the reasons I've just given, is that Article 5 is to be interpreted, or if necessary, modified in a way that avoids inconsistency with the Geneva Convention regime.

<<1890.19;1901.15;en>>
So on this case, on that analysis, Article 5 of the Convention must be interpreted as permitting the capture and detention of suspected combatants.

<<1901.15;1911.76;en>>
It may be possible, indeed the applicant himself appears to suggest it, to interpret the term offense within Article 5.1c so as to include participation

<<1911.76;1920.19;en>>
in the conflict as an enemy combatant, and hence subject to detention as a prisoner of war within GC3.

<<1920.19;1939.12;en>>
This approach would also require the procedural safeguards in Article 5, powers 2 to 5, to be modified or interpreted to have the same substantive content as the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law so far as concerns the capture and detention of prisoners of war in this context.

<<1939.12;1959.23;en>>
We note that a paragraph 53 of their submission, the Amicus Curiae brief, concludes that in relation to the grounds of detention, the type of review mechanism applicable, and the trigger for release, there would only be a violation of human rights law if there were a violation of GCs 3 or 4.

<<1959.23;1964.31;en>>
So the outcome is the subject of at least some common ground between some of the parties.

<<1964.31;1975.93;en>>
The real question, we submit, is the principle's route to that outcome, displacement of Article 5 by the lex specialis principle, or modification of it as a result of that.

<<1975.93;1997.91;en>>
Turning very briefly to the facts, and assuming that Tariq Hassan was within the jurisdiction at all times, contrary to our primary case, he was captured on the 23rd of April, 2003, as a suspected combatant, treated as a presumed prisoner of war, and taken to Camp Bucca for the determination of his status.

<<1997.91;2002.33;en>>
Once that was done, and it was speedily done, he was cleared for release.

<<2002.33;2010.79;en>>
From the 25th of April, he was no longer being detained in Camp Bucca, but was simply there awaiting safe transport to his place of capture.

<<2010.79;2015.95;en>>
He was then released, almost certainly, on the 2nd of May, 2003.

<<2015.95;2023.84;en>>
All of that was precisely consistent with the applicable rules of GC3, as no one appears to deny.

<<2023.84;2030.23;en>>
Article 5 should produce, and if necessary, we submit, at least can produce, no different answer.

<<2030.23;2034.73;en>>
Specifically, it is possible to interpret Article 5.1c

<<2034.73;2038.27;en>>
sufficiently broadly to include situations such as this.

<<2038.27;2046.28;en>>
Offense would need to be interpreted to include participation as a suspected enemy combatant.

<<2046.28;2061.91;en>>
The requirement for status to be determined by a competent tribunal under Article 5 of GC3 did not, on our facts, turn out to be necessary, because he was determined to be a civilian, and then cleared for release.

<<2061.91;2071.16;en>>
That swift determination also lies at the heart of the case under the ECHR procedural guarantees in Article 5, powers 2 to 4.

<<2071.16;2084.12;en>>
If they are not displaced entirely, they can and should be approached and applied in the way that we've submitted in our observations between paragraphs 137 and 143.

<<2084.12;2093.66;en>>
The short point is that they did not arise given the swift determination that he should be released as a civilian posing no real security risk.

<<2093.66;2100.24;en>>
For all of those reasons, my submission is that Tariq Hassan was not within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.

<<2100.24;2106.26;en>>
But even if he was, there is nothing on the facts of his case to support a finding of violation of any of Articles 2, 3, or 5.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<2114.36;2117.88;en>>
Thank you Mr Eadie. I call Mr Otty.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<2120.8;2125.56;en>>
Mr. President, in April 2003, Tarek Hassan was taken into

<<2125.56;2129.92;en>>
custody by United Kingdom forces in Iraq.

<<2129.92;2145.9;en>>
In September of that year, he was found dead with his hands tied together with wire, with multiple bullet wounds, and with an identity tag in his pocket issued by Camp Bucca, the detention camp in which he had been held.

<<2145.9;2149.06;en>>
The only people known to have seen Mr. Hassan in the time

<<2149.06;2158.0;en>>
between his capture and death are the UK forces themselves and American forces also at Camp Bucca.

<<2158.0;2165.06;en>>
No independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death or detention has been held.

<<2165.06;2171.96;en>>
Not a single witness statement from any of the soldiers responsible for his capture has been taken.

<<2171.96;2182.4;en>>
And contradictory documentary material of significance has emerged only slowly over time, including most recently, a matter of weeks ago.

<<2182.4;2185.36;en>>
Against that background, it is submitted that Mr. Hassan's

<<2185.36;2192.86;en>>
procedural and substantive rights under Articles 2, 3, and 5 of the Convention have been violated.

<<2192.86;2196.06;en>>
All of the applicant's written submissions are maintained.

<<2196.06;2200.82;en>>
But for today's purposes, I will focus on three core propositions.

<<2200.82;2204.46;en>>
First, Mr. Hassan was within the jurisdiction of the United

<<2204.46;2207.9;en>>
Kingdom under Article 1 of the Convention.

<<2207.9;2210.96;en>>
Secondly, the protections owed to Mr. Hassan under the

<<2210.96;2220.76;en>>
Convention were, in the absence of an Article 15 derogation, not displaced in any sense by international humanitarian law.

<<2220.76;2232.56;en>>
Thirdly, the principal facts relating to the arrest and alleged release show the inadequacy of investigation to date and a violation of each of the rights identified.

<<2232.56;2234.56;en>>
Jurisdiction first.

<<2234.56;2244.76;en>>
Following the Grand Chamber's decision in Al-Skaini, there can no longer be any doubt that this applicant's case and this application raises matters within the U.K.'s

<<2244.76;2247.16;en>>
Article 1 jurisdiction.

<<2247.16;2272.06;en>>
In its judgment in Al-Skaini, the Grand Chamber expressly recognized that extraterritorial jurisdiction may arise in certain circumstances, including, first, where the state's agents exercise control and authority over an individual, and secondly, where the state, as a result of military action, exercises effective control over the area in which the acts in issue are alleged to have occurred.

<<2272.06;2275.5;en>>
Both principles are satisfied here.

<<2275.5;2279.8;en>>
So far as state agent authority is concerned, the position is simple.

<<2279.8;2283.1;en>>
Mr. Hassan was captured by U.K. forces.

<<2283.1;2287.26;en>>
He was processed and interrogated by U.K. forces.

<<2287.26;2291.42;en>>
His detention remained under U.K. control at all times,

<<2291.42;2295.06;en>>
and it is U.K. forces who were purportedly involved in making

<<2295.06;2297.46;en>>
arrangements for his release.

<<2297.46;2306.1;en>>
This was a classic exercise of jurisdiction of the kind recognized by the U.K. itself in the Bankovic proceedings.

<<2306.1;2308.8;en>>
The U.K.'s argument in the present proceedings that state

<<2308.8;2313.96;en>>
agent authority in jurisdiction is not made out is of no merit.

<<2313.96;2322.4;en>>
It contends, first, that jurisdiction did not apply at the moment of capture because the convention was entirely displaced by IHL.

<<2322.4;2336.76;en>>
That approach is contrary to the wording of the convention, contrary to the judgments of this court, contrary to the judgments of the International Court of Justice, and contrary to statements by all relevant United Nations bodies and officeholders.

<<2336.76;2342.02;en>>
The government then contends that at Kambuka, Mr. Hassan was transferred to the custody of the United States

<<2342.02;2346.72;en>>
forces, and that at least from that point, jurisdiction ceased.

<<2346.72;2351.32;en>>
That, too, is a submission which must be rejected on the facts.

<<2351.32;2356.6;en>>
First, the detention was pursuant to a memorandum of arrangement under which the U.K. expressly remained a

<<2356.6;2358.62;en>>
detaining power.

<<2358.62;2361.82;en>>
Secondly, the U.K. paid the United States for guarding Mr.

<<2361.82;2365.2;en>>
Hassan and its other detainees.

<<2365.2;2367.3;en>>
Thirdly, Mr. Hassan was apparently held,

<<2367.3;2373.52;en>>
at least for some of the time he was detained, in a U.K.-designated compound within Kambuka,

<<2373.52;2376.9;en>>
and throughout the whole period, U.K. military policemen were

<<2376.9;2380.2;en>>
responsible for his welfare.

<<2380.2;2384.0;en>>
Fourthly, he was registered on a U.K.-run prisoner database and

<<2384.0;2388.2;en>>
issued with a U.K. identity number and bracelet.

<<2388.2;2391.2;en>>
Fifthly, it was the U.K. which was responsible with liaising

<<2391.2;2395.42;en>>
with the Red Cross about the treatment of U.K. detainees,

<<2395.42;2398.76;en>>
retained full rights of access to U.K. detainees,

<<2398.76;2401.76;en>>
and treated U.K. detainees at their own hospitals if they

<<2401.76;2403.76;en>>
needed treatment.

<<2403.76;2406.72;en>>
And, sixthly, the U.K. was responsible for determining

<<2406.72;2410.82;en>>
whether and when Mr. Hassan would be released.

<<2410.82;2414.16;en>>
Now, even if those facts did not establish that the U.K. had

<<2414.16;2418.4;en>>
authority and control over every single aspect of Mr. Hassan's

<<2418.4;2427.66;en>>
detention for all purposes, they certainly established that it had authority and control over the aspects which are relevant to this case.

<<2427.66;2447.2;en>>
It also merits emphasis in this context that the Grand Chamber in both Al-Skhaini and Hersey-Jamar has defined the concept of state agent authority jurisdiction as resting on control and authority, and not as requiring exclusivity of the kind the government contends for in its submissions.

<<2447.2;2455.36;en>>
Cases such as Issaq and Solomou likewise use the phrase authority and or effective control as their touchstone.

<<2455.36;2471.56;en>>
That approach is obviously right as a matter of principle, given the overarching protective intent of the convention reflected in cases such as El-Masri, and because it would otherwise be open to a member state to subcontract out of its own obligations.

<<2471.56;2476.66;en>>
The second principle which I've referred to, effective control of an area, also applies.

<<2476.66;2487.9;en>>
But given the clarity of the position in relation to state agency authority, I do not propose to take time on this aspect, save to make three points in addition to those in the written submissions.

<<2487.9;2496.9;en>>
First, in the Black Watch document dated 23rd April 2003, disclosed by the U.K. for the first time 10 years later in

<<2496.9;2507.9;en>>
September of this year, it is recorded that British soldiers are increasingly being encouraged by Civpop to intervene in family-stripe neighborhood disputes.

<<2507.9;2510.66;en>>
Comments such as these were consistent with other U.K.

<<2510.66;2515.7;en>>
materials describing the U.K. as an occupying power discharging

<<2515.7;2520.36;en>>
policing functions as early as the 9th of April 2003.

<<2520.36;2525.02;en>>
They show the extent of control U.K. forces were seen by the U.K.

<<2525.02;2531.16;en>>
as enjoying, and that it extended far beyond ordinary military activities.

<<2531.16;2537.92;en>>
Secondly, as the evidence of Major Wilson shows, U.K. forces were purporting to detain individuals at Camp Buka

<<2537.92;2541.7;en>>
for criminal justice purposes at the time of Mr. Hassan's

<<2541.7;2543.52;en>>
detention.

<<2543.52;2557.5;en>>
And thirdly, even if the government's submissions were right, that it was only in effective control of the area in issue from the 1st of May 2003, then it would still have had effective control during part of the period in which Mr. Hassan

<<2557.5;2562.56;en>>
was detained, as well as at the time of his purported release.

<<2562.56;2568.7;en>>
There is one further point of law of wider importance on the issue of jurisdiction which merits brief comment.

<<2568.7;2577.86;en>>
The government in its observations specifically invites the Grand Chamber to confirm that the concept of jurisdiction is not subject to the living instrument doctrine.

<<2577.86;2581.76;en>>
That arises from a suggestion to this effect in Bankovic.

<<2581.76;2588.02;en>>
Although it is not necessary to resolve this issue in this case because Mr. Hassan was so clearly within classic,

<<2588.02;2598.92;en>>
well-established concepts of jurisdiction, it is important to note that that argument has recently been expressly rejected by the United Kingdom's own Supreme Court.

<<2598.92;2611.72;en>>
In the case of Smith against Ministry of Defense, the court extended the protection of the convention to British servicemen abroad and stated that the suggestion in Bankovic can no longer be regarded as entirely accurate.

<<2611.72;2619.06;en>>
The court will also be aware that the government's position in this regard has been rejected in international law more generally.

<<2619.06;2636.72;en>>
In the Aegean Sea continental shelf case, the International Court of Justice characterized it as inconceivable that terms like domestic jurisdiction and territorial status were intended to have a fixed content regardless of the subsequent evolution of international law.

<<2636.72;2646.72;en>>
That potential for evolution and development is moreover strongly supported by statements such as that made recently by the Grand Chamber in the Al-Masri case.

<<2646.72;2662.16;en>>
There the court stated as follows, the convention is an instrument for the protection of human rights and it is of crucial importance that it is interpreted and applied in a manner that renders those rights practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory.

<<2662.16;2671.72;en>>
This concerns, the Grand Chamber continued, not only the interpretation of substantive provisions of the convention, but also procedural provisions.

<<2671.72;2678.86;en>>
The applicant accordingly invites the Grand Chamber to decline to give the government the confirmation it seeks.

<<2678.86;2683.86;en>>
I turn next to the relationship between the convention and IHL.

<<2683.86;2696.4;en>>
The government's primary position is that IHL displaces the convention because it is argued the relevant acts took place within the active combat phase of an international armed conflict.

<<2696.4;2700.66;en>>
The applicant contends that this argument fails at the first hurdle.

<<2700.66;2709.8;en>>
He does not accept for the reasons set out in his written submissions that the relevant acts did take place during such an active combat phase.

<<2709.8;2712.16;en>>
By the time Mr. Hassan was arrested,

<<2712.16;2724.96;en>>
Saddam Hussein's regime had fallen and there are numerous indications that significant combat operations were over, both generally and at least in the area concerned in this case.

<<2724.96;2729.3;en>>
In any event, however, the government's position is wrong in law.

<<2729.3;2736.56;en>>
The convention is not displaced and it continues to apply for at least three reasons.

<<2736.56;2747.36;en>>
First, the convention is absolutely clear that its provisions continue to apply in times of war unless the subject of an express derogation.

<<2747.36;2753.8;en>>
What otherwise is the purpose of the derogation provision in Article 15?

<<2753.8;2770.76;en>>
Secondly, that position that relevant human rights treaties continue to apply in situations of conflict, as in peace, has been consistently and repeatedly recognized as correct by this court and by other international courts, tribunals and treaty bodies.

<<2770.76;2778.8;en>>
Thirdly, there is no conceptual difficulty with the idea that IHL and human rights law may overlap in certain circumstances.

<<2778.8;2791.22;en>>
But in proceedings before this court, absent a derogation, this cannot lead to any reduction in the protection provided by the convention, and there can be no question of displacement.

<<2791.22;2797.4;en>>
IHL is a safety net applicable even in the event of a derogation.

<<2797.4;2804.0;en>>
It is not a means of the state's obligations being independently watered down.

<<2804.0;2806.82;en>>
The first of these points requires little elaboration.

<<2806.82;2810.92;en>>
Article 15.1 of the convention creates a specific procedure

<<2810.92;2820.36;en>>
under which it may be possible to derogate from certain provisions in order to deal with war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation.

<<2820.36;2823.7;en>>
There was no such derogation in this case.

<<2823.7;2828.06;en>>
The government has offered no explanation why this is so.

<<2828.06;2837.72;en>>
And Article 15 would be rendered largely redundant if a de facto derogation could now be implied in the way the government apparently suggests.

<<2837.72;2851.76;en>>
The applicant contends simply that unless and until the formal gateway of derogation is passed through, there can be no possibility of applying IHL in preference to convention law as a matter of first principle.

<<2851.76;2865.86;en>>
The second point is that the government's displacement theory would be inconsistent with the practical and protective intent of the convention, and the previous case law and learning of the court and all other major international courts and treaty bodies.

<<2865.86;2884.06;en>>
The court's own case law has repeatedly applied the convention in situations of international and non-international armed conflict, most recently in Al-Jeddah, but also in earlier cases concerned with northern Cyprus, southeast Turkey, northern Iraq, Chechnya, and Georgia.

<<2884.06;2893.96;en>>
The ICJ has addressed this question on several occasions, ruling repeatedly that IHL does not displace international human rights law in wartime.

<<2893.96;2910.1;en>>
In the Palestinian wall advisory opinion, it held that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in cases of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant.

<<2910.1;2923.0;en>>
In Congo against Uganda, a case concerned with widespread human rights abuses by Ugandan forces on Congolese territory, the court again cited this passage from the wall case with specific approval.

<<2923.0;2927.06;en>>
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has been just as clear.

<<2927.06;2936.5;en>>
In court against the United States, the case relating to the United States' intervention in Grenada, the commission emphasized the primacy of human rights law.

<<2936.5;2960.66;en>>
It said, as a general matter, while the commission may find it necessary to look at the applicable rules of international humanitarian law when interpreting and applying the norms of the Inter-American human rights system, where those bodies of law provide levels of protection which are distinct, the commission is bound by its charter-based mandate to give effect to the normative standard which best safeguards the rights of the individual.

<<2960.66;2963.62;en>>
The U.N. General Assembly, the U.N. Human Rights Committee, the

<<2963.62;2967.12;en>>
U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the U.N. Special

<<2967.12;2977.52;en>>
Rapporteurs are all likewise consistent in their repeated statements that fundamental human rights are not displaced by situations of armed conflict.

<<2977.52;2990.16;en>>
In the words of the General Assembly in Resolution 2675, as long ago as 1970, it was said that such rights continue to apply fully in such situations.

<<2990.16;3001.0;en>>
The third and final point on this issue is that there is, in any event, no reason in principle why it is impossible to reconcile the application of IHL and the Convention.

<<3001.0;3005.92;en>>
Both regimes may bind the state in a conflict situation.

<<3005.92;3021.16;en>>
But that does not alter the fact that it is the Convention which this Court is obliged to apply by virtue of Article 19 of the Convention, and that absent a derogation, the Convention is not in any sense displaced.

<<3021.16;3031.8;en>>
That is the clear effect of the Grand Chamber's analysis in Al-Jadda, where it was held that only a Security Council resolution, which explicitly or implicitly required the U.K. to

<<3031.8;3042.16;en>>
place an individual into indefinite detention without charge, and so raised a mandatory conflict with the Convention, could have this displacement effect.

<<3042.16;3054.66;en>>
There is simply no basis for suggesting any such direct conflict here, or for concluding that IHL could create an obligation of a kind equivalent to a Security Council resolution.

<<3054.66;3079.3;en>>
In those circumstances, the simple, clear, principled answer to the inquiry as to the relationship between the two legal regimes is that while both regimes will apply to restrict the state, IHL cannot reduce the protection which would otherwise be available to the individual, or create a power of detention where otherwise there would be none.

<<3079.3;3094.46;en>>
As on the issue of jurisdiction, the Government's submission should be rejected as contrary to well-established jurisprudence, and as advocating a regional fragmentation of established international legal principles.

<<3094.46;3099.36;en>>
Finally, I would like to return to the facts.

<<3099.36;3105.26;en>>
I'll focus on three areas, Mr. Hassan's arrest, his release,

<<3105.26;3111.86;en>>
and the need for an investigation, and an independent investigation, into his fate.

<<3111.86;3114.12;en>>
First, the arrest.

<<3114.12;3116.96;en>>
The applicant has always maintained that Mr. Hassan was

<<3116.96;3124.86;en>>
detained because the applicant was an important figure in the Ba'ath Party, and because U.K. forces wished to encourage him

<<3124.86;3130.1;en>>
to surrender by detaining Mr. Hassan, who was his brother.

<<3130.1;3133.8;en>>
A neighbor of Mr. Hassan and both his sisters claimed that

<<3133.8;3137.06;en>>
they were informed that Mr. Hassan would only be released

<<3137.06;3140.86;en>>
if the applicant surrendered.

<<3140.86;3148.56;en>>
As against that evidence, the Government's case has been presented in an unsatisfactory and inconsistent manner.

<<3148.56;3152.12;en>>
It was originally contended that Mr. Hassan's arrest was a result

<<3152.12;3154.5;en>>
of mistaken identity.

<<3154.5;3157.92;en>>
That case did not arise from the recollection of any witness.

<<3157.92;3169.5;en>>
It appears to have been reconstructed by the Government from the documentary record, which at the point the argument was advanced was woefully incomplete.

<<3169.5;3176.4;en>>
The argument was first undermined by the disclosure in January of this year of a record of Mr. Hassan's interview at

<<3176.4;3186.62;en>>
Kambuka by American forces, which recorded in terms that he, and I quote, knows that he was brought in because of his brother.

<<3186.62;3193.42;en>>
That document shows, or at least bears the strong inference, that Mr. Hassan had been informed that he had been detained

<<3193.42;3202.36;en>>
because of his brother's importance and that this was also known to be the position by his interrogators.

<<3202.36;3215.22;en>>
The mistaken identity case was then utterly destroyed by the emergence in September of 2013 of the contemporaneous Black Watch document at GA3.

<<3215.22;3218.72;en>>
This document described Mr. Hassan's arrest and expressly

<<3218.72;3223.2;en>>
recorded that prior to detention Mr. Hassan had confessed that

<<3223.2;3226.3;en>>
he was the brother of the applicant.

<<3226.3;3236.02;en>>
The Government, of course, does not now pursue its mistaken identity case and argues on the basis of the reference in that same Black Watch document to Mr. Hassan as a gunman that he was

<<3236.02;3239.16;en>>
captured as a suspected combatant.

<<3239.16;3246.76;en>>
But this new fallback case is on analysis as weak as the mistaken identity case initially advanced.

<<3246.76;3259.36;en>>
First, the document on which it is based records a peaceful, and to use the words of the document, friendly operation in which coalition forces went from house to house, talking to locals and gathering information.

<<3259.36;3263.52;en>>
It does not record any attack or attempted attack by Mr. Hassan,

<<3263.52;3266.66;en>>
and it is hard to see how the U.K. forces can have suspected

<<3266.66;3273.8;en>>
him of being a combatant when there is no suggestion of any actual or even threatened combat.

<<3273.8;3277.66;en>>
Secondly, the document does not itself say that Mr. Hassan was

<<3277.66;3282.22;en>>
detained because of any combatant or suspected combatant status.

<<3282.22;3287.26;en>>
All it records is that he was the brother of an individual of some importance.

<<3287.26;3293.22;en>>
The most obvious inference is that he was detained because of that family connection.

<<3293.22;3297.2;en>>
Thirdly, the mere possession of a gun by Mr. Hassan in Iraq in

<<3297.2;3302.1;en>>
2003 cannot suffice for a conclusion of combatant status.

<<3302.1;3313.56;en>>
The Handbook of International Humanitarian Law cited by the government in its own submissions notes in terms that many Iraqi individuals lawfully carry AK-47s.

<<3313.56;3326.8;en>>
Likewise, the Black Watch documentation itself records clerics lawfully traveling in the company of gunmen for security purposes, and the Black Watch Battalion releasing individuals on that basis.

<<3326.8;3333.5;en>>
Fourthly, not a single witness from the Black Watch Battalion said to have been responsible for Mr. Hassan's detention has

<<3333.5;3338.3;en>>
been interviewed, let alone presented to the court by the government.

<<3338.3;3342.12;en>>
Fifthly, the notes of Mr. Hassan's interview by American

<<3342.12;3347.2;en>>
forces bear no suggestion of any suspicion that he was a combatant.

<<3347.2;3354.56;en>>
On the contrary, they record in terms that he seems to be a good kid, innocent of anything himself.

<<3354.56;3357.76;en>>
As to the true reason for Mr. Hassan's detention, as I've

<<3357.76;3363.36;en>>
already said, these notes record instead that he knows he was brought in because of his brother.

<<3363.36;3371.62;en>>
They also state that he could know more about his brother's activities in the Ba'ath Party and some of his friends involved in the party.

<<3371.62;3375.3;en>>
Using any type of harsh approach is not going to be effective.

<<3375.3;3382.66;en>>
He will cooperate, but he needs someone he can trust if he's going to tell information about his brother that is going to harm him.

<<3382.66;3389.76;en>>
These observations are entirely consistent with the applicant's case that Mr. Hassan was detained because of some desire

<<3389.76;3396.1;en>>
to exploit his relationship to his brother, and are inconsistent with the government's case.

<<3396.1;3398.8;en>>
Sixthly, the notes of Mr. Hassan's interview by British

<<3398.8;3403.02;en>>
forces do not say anything about Mr. Hassan having been suspected

<<3403.02;3405.26;en>>
of being a combatant either.

<<3405.26;3415.06;en>>
On the contrary, they record that he was of no intelligence value, and the very heading of the documentation identifies him as a civilian from Basra.

<<3415.06;3425.6;en>>
Major X has explained that these notes would have been produced after sight of the capture card prepared by the detaining unit, a document which has still not been produced.

<<3425.6;3429.9;en>>
If that card had identified Mr. Hassan as a suspected combatant,

<<3429.9;3432.96;en>>
that would inevitably have appeared in these notes.

<<3432.96;3440.96;en>>
The fact that the notes identify him instead as a civilian strongly suggests that that is what the detaining unit recorded.

<<3440.96;3456.46;en>>
The result of all of this is that, as in Al-Jadda, none of the justifications for detention in Article V of the Convention are made out, and none of the procedural protections required by Article V were adhered to.

<<3456.46;3464.1;en>>
The government would, furthermore, be no better off, even if IHL were somehow to be read into Article V.

<<3464.1;3469.96;en>>
None of the justifications for detention provided by IHL are made out either.

<<3469.96;3472.76;en>>
It cannot be said that Mr. Hassan was a member of opposing

<<3472.76;3479.36;en>>
forces, representing a security threat, let alone that as a civilian, as the U.K.'s own documentation

<<3479.36;3487.72;en>>
describes him, some imperative reasons of security or absolute necessity was capable of justifying his detention.

<<3487.72;3501.16;en>>
Finally, as the Essex Human Rights Center intervention has observed, the detention of civilians as a bargaining chip is, of course, strictly prohibited and amounts to a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

<<3501.16;3503.4;en>>
So far as Mr. Hassan's release is concerned,

<<3503.4;3510.26;en>>
the evidence as to when and how release occurred is, again, deeply unsatisfactory.

<<3510.26;3521.92;en>>
First, a record was apparently made on the British Armed Forces database on the 4th of May, 2003, asserting that he had been released shortly after midnight on the 2nd of May.

<<3521.92;3531.46;en>>
Secondly, the British Armed Forces made a further record on the 12th of May, recording that he was found to be absent and so was deemed to have been released on that day.

<<3531.46;3536.6;en>>
Thirdly, the database of the American Armed Forces, whom the U.K. government insists in these proceedings were in

<<3536.6;3542.8;en>>
control of the camp, did not record release until the 17th of May, 2003.

<<3542.8;3545.12;en>>
Fourthly, whenever Mr. Hassan was released,

<<3545.12;3549.12;en>>
it's not at all clear how the release was actually effected.

<<3549.12;3562.42;en>>
The government says that the 4th of May, 2003 record shows that he was released by coach to Umm Khazar, but there is an inconsistency in the documentation as to whether Umm Khazar was ever a drop-off point for detainees.

<<3562.42;3568.22;en>>
In any event, there is no evidence as to what, if any, arrangements were made to ensure Mr. Hassan could

<<3568.22;3571.82;en>>
return home safely from the drop-off point.

<<3571.82;3582.4;en>>
The circumstances in which he was found dead hundreds of miles away, without having contacted any member of his family in the meantime, and while still carrying his Camp Buka U.K.

<<3582.4;3586.92;en>>
I.D. tag, remain wholly unexplained.

<<3586.92;3590.9;en>>
Finally, I turn specifically to the need for an investigation.

<<3590.9;3597.46;en>>
The government has asserted that there is no breach of any investigative duty in relation to Mr. Hassan's fate,

<<3597.46;3602.12;en>>
because everything that could be done to investigate the matter has now been done.

<<3602.12;3605.46;en>>
There are a series of problems with that approach.

<<3605.46;3612.7;en>>
First, it was an assertion first made to this court in March of 2012, prior to the production of the U.S.

<<3612.7;3616.3;en>>
interview record supportive of Mr. Hassan's case,

<<3616.3;3618.76;en>>
prior to the production of a witness statement from the U.K.'s

<<3618.76;3624.7;en>>
interrogation team, and prior to the production of the Blackwatch document.

<<3624.7;3632.82;en>>
Secondly, it was only almost a year later, in January of 2013, that the report of the U.S. interrogation was produced.

<<3632.82;3641.86;en>>
That document, as I have submitted, was highly significant as undermining the suggestion that Mr. Hassan's arrest was a result of mistaken identity,

<<3641.86;3653.06;en>>
indicating that he knew he had been brought in because of his relationship to his brother, and showing that consideration was being given to the exploitation of that relationship.

<<3653.06;3664.46;en>>
Thirdly, it was only in March of this year that the government announced in a letter to the court that 10 years on, it was taking steps to trace the individuals who had questioned Mr. Hassan.

<<3664.46;3670.66;en>>
Fourthly, it was only in May of this year that the government then produced a witness statement from Major X.

<<3670.66;3679.6;en>>
At this point, the government admitted, frankly, having taken the view in February of 2012, that it had not appeared necessary to interview him.

<<3679.6;3694.96;en>>
Fifthly, in September of this year, the government, with its third round of submissions in these proceedings, produced highly significant new material, notably the heavily redacted Blackwatch document, upon which it now hinges its case as to the reason for Mr.

<<3694.96;3697.22;en>>
Hassan's detention.

<<3697.22;3702.8;en>>
Its explanation was that the new material had not been picked up in any previous searches.

<<3702.8;3713.6;en>>
But the Blackwatch document contains the name Kadeem Rehsan Hussan, the applicant's own name, with only slight variance and in block capitals.

<<3713.6;3720.16;en>>
That document obviously ought to have been picked up through the most basic of keyword searches at an earlier stage.

<<3720.16;3729.46;en>>
And it would have been picked up in any event if the government had looked through the documents it held in relation to operations on the relevant day.

<<3729.46;3741.36;en>>
Sixthly, on the 2nd of December, 2013, less than two weeks ago, the government disclosed a copy of the same Blackwatch document with fewer redactions.

<<3741.36;3747.8;en>>
It has explained the meaning of the remaining redactions by saying that they are necessary in the interests of national security.

<<3747.8;3753.96;en>>
Whether or not the still redacted material is relevant to Mr. Hassan's fate, or any issues in this case,

<<3753.96;3756.76;en>>
remains unexplained.

<<3756.76;3769.66;en>>
And seventhly, as I've already said, even now, there has been no attempt to take statements from any of the Blackwatch unit responsible for the detention operation at the heart of this case.

<<3769.66;3789.5;en>>
It's clear from all of this that when the government says that it is confident that it now has an accurate understanding of the relevant facts, the court should proceed with considerable caution and should bear in mind that it is not the first time that the government has had that confidence and that it has in the past proved to be misplaced.

<<3789.5;3794.2;en>>
Six core factors remain at the heart of this case.

<<3794.2;3798.42;en>>
First, Mr. Hassan was a civilian and was not, in fact,

<<3798.42;3801.3;en>>
an enemy combatant of any kind.

<<3801.3;3804.66;en>>
Secondly, he was taken into custody by the U.K.

<<3804.66;3808.0;en>>
in April of 2003.

<<3808.0;3817.5;en>>
Thirdly, his body was found months later with his hands tied and with him still in possession of a Camp Buca identity tag.

<<3817.5;3825.62;en>>
Fourthly, the documentary record as to the reasons for his detention and the timing of his release are inconsistent.

<<3825.62;3840.92;en>>
Fifthly, his neighbors and relatives, now supported in their account by contemporaneous United States documentation, were told that the initial motivation for his detention was a desire to pressurize his brother into surrender.

<<3840.92;3849.42;en>>
And, sixthly, there has been no independent investigation into what occurred.

<<3849.42;3851.86;en>>
Mr. President, that state of affairs would be as

<<3851.86;3861.58;en>>
unsatisfactory and unjustifiable under IHL as it is under the convention which this court is bound to apply.

<<3861.58;3868.98;en>>
And against that background, the court is invited to uphold each of the applicant's complaints made and to grant him the relief sought.

<<3868.98;3868.98;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<3872.46;3878.62;en>>
Thank you Mr. Otty. I now turn to the judges if there are questions.

<<3878.62;3882.14;en>>
Judge Yudkivska please.

[[Judge;Ganna Yudkivska]]

<<3892.75;3894.51;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<3894.51;3898.11;en>>
I have questions to the government.

<<3898.11;3903.79;en>>
First of all, on the facts, I understand that Camp Bucca was U.S.-run camp.

<<3903.79;3923.97;en>>
But yet, I will need clarification which state, the United Kingdom or the United States, or a combination of the two, was ultimately responsible for determining Tarek's status, the legality of his detention, and for ordering his release.

<<3923.97;3931.25;en>>
My second question is again for the government, and this time on the law.

<<3931.25;3956.37;en>>
In the case of person interned as a prisoner of war or as a civilian giving rise to a threat to security in the context of an international art conflict, should the requirements of Article 5 of the Convention be qualified or displaced by the provisions of third or fourth conventions?

<<3956.37;3961.85;en>>
What is the meaning of displacement or qualification in this context?

<<3961.85;3971.45;en>>
And to what extent, if at all, should the safeguards under Article 5, paragraph 1, 2, and 4 continue to apply?

<<3971.45;3971.45;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<3973.34;3974.46;en>>
Thank you, Judge Ziemele.

[[Judge;Ineta Ziemele]]

<<3980.35;3982.35;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<3982.35;3993.19;en>>
As a follow-up to the questions by Judge Yudkivska, the question to the government that the applicants may want to comment as well.

<<3993.19;4015.79;en>>
First, as to your thesis that the convention is displaced in the context of armed conflict, what value do you attribute to the International Courts of Justice statement of principle in the Wall advisory opinion, as repeated subsequently in a number of judgments?

<<4015.79;4029.55;en>>
And what is the government's position as to whether this court should take an inspiration in those principles as identified by the ICJ?

<<4029.55;4036.59;en>>
And that concerns the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law.

<<4036.59;4038.31;en>>
That's the first question.

<<4038.31;4052.35;en>>
The second question, if the government would be so kind to point out in terms of Geneva Convention No. 3 and in terms of Article 4, the groups of combatants, to which group would

<<4052.35;4057.79;en>>
you attribute Mr. Hassan exactly?

<<4057.79;4067.39;en>>
Then as concerns the release, exactly the facts surrounding a release of Mr. Hassan,

<<4067.39;4072.87;en>>
would you explain these discrepancies in various records?

<<4072.87;4079.15;en>>
We indeed have several dates, 2nd May, 12 May, 17 May.

<<4079.15;4086.67;en>>
How does it happen that there is no – one clear record on the release?

<<4086.67;4097.43;en>>
How does it happen that it is still uncertain which drop-off point exactly was he – well, dropped off?

<<4097.43;4117.47;en>>
And do you consider that this lack of precision in the records is compatible with the principle under Geneva Convention No. 4, which requires to provide for safe release of civilians if

<<4117.47;4121.67;en>>
Mr. Hassan is to be presumed a civilian?

<<4121.67;4125.95;en>>
And finally, a small question.

<<4125.95;4134.79;en>>
You are also aware that under Article 106 in Geneva Convention No. 4, there is an obligation

<<4134.79;4156.71;en>>
to have the internees to make them contact their family, and there is also an information that, well, an independent body such as ICRC is informed of the presence of the particular internee.

<<4156.71;4162.51;en>>
Could you provide the Court with an information what happened exactly in the case of Mr. Hassan

<<4162.51;4168.63;en>>
in terms of contacts with the outside world, the outside institution?

<<4168.63;4168.63;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4170.92;4172.74;en>>
Thank you.

<<4172.74;4174.74;en>>
Judge Mahoney, please.

[[Judge;Paul Mahoney]]

<<4177.07;4178.55;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4178.55;4181.43;en>>
I have three questions.

<<4181.43;4187.47;en>>
First of all, two questions on the fact that are addressed to the government.

<<4187.47;4222.19;en>>
Number one question, the government have informed the court that the military order in force at the relevant time called for a two-stage screening process for prisoners claiming to be innocent civilians with an initial interview to determine civilian status, and then a second interview to determine whether there were grounds to suspect that the person concerned was a security risk or a criminal risk.

<<4222.19;4231.87;en>>
Well, did the two interviews carried out in respect of Tarek Hassan correspond to this two-stage process?

<<4231.87;4246.75;en>>
Was it normal practice for one interview to be carried out by United States agents and one interview by the second one by United Kingdom agents?

<<4246.75;4252.99;en>>
And if not, why did this take place in Tarek Hassan's case?

<<4252.99;4272.91;en>>
The second question on the facts is, was Tarek Hassan detained in a compound specifically set aside for United Kingdom detainees at any stage while he was at Camp Bucca?

<<4272.91;4280.71;en>>
Third question I have is a question on the law, and it is addressed to both parties.

<<4280.71;4303.35;en>>
The question is, do the terms of Article 15 of the convention allow a state to derogate from its obligations under Article 5 in the context of an international armed conflict, such as the military intervention in Iraq?

<<4303.35;4326.39;en>>
And would it be necessary for a state formally to lodge such a derogation in order for the court to interpret Article 5, so as to take account of the context and also of the applicable norms of international humanitarian law?

<<4326.39;4327.47;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4327.47;4328.97;en>>
Those are my three questions.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4329.37;4332.47;en>>
Thank you, Judge Mahoney.

<<4332.47;4334.13;en>>
Judge López Guerra.

[[Judge;Luis López Guerra]]

<<4336.57;4343.3;en>>
Thank you. Only one question to the government concerning the circumstances of the release

<<4343.3;4351.45;en>>
of Mr. Tarek Hassan on some date on the month of May of 2003. I see that in the observations

<<4351.45;4364.73;en>>
of the government in page 15, the government concerning the place of release gives two alternatives, either Umm Qasr or Basrah. Well, there is some difference because Umm

<<4364.73;4372.89;en>>
Qasr was the home of Mr. Tarek Hassan, it's two and a half kilometers from Camp Bucca, and

<<4372.89;4381.34;en>>
Basrah is 50 kilometers north, a dangerous place. Would it be possible for the government

<<4381.34;4393.57;en>>
to maybe to ask some additional clarification of where was it released, in which one of these two places, or give some brief accounting of what was the usual proceeding for release?

<<4393.57;4405.3;en>>
I mean, where the prisoners were transferred to Iraqi authorities, or where they transferred to some ONG or the Red Cross, or where they just left in some village or some highway.

<<4405.3;4409.97;en>>
I think that could be interesting information. Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4411.54;4412.3;en>>
Thank you.

<<4412.3;4413.3;en>>
Judge Nußberger, please.

[[Judge;Angelika Nußberger]]

<<4415.75;4416.75;en>>
Thank you.

<<4416.75;4420.95;en>>
I would also just have one question about concrete detail.

<<4420.95;4433.99;en>>
The applicants submit that Tarek Hassan was found, his body, his dead body was found, and he still had the ID, the UK ID tag in his pocket.

<<4433.99;4442.39;en>>
So what was the practice of the British forces with ID tags as soon as they released prisoners?

<<4442.39;4446.39;en>>
Were the ID tag usually taken away?

<<4446.39;4450.51;en>>
What was done with a United States ID tag?

<<4450.51;4451.51;en>>
What was the practice there?

<<4451.51;4451.51;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4454.05;4457.29;en>>
Thank you, Judge Paulo de Albuquerque.

[[Judge;Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque]]

<<4458.59;4459.88;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4459.88;4466.09;en>>
My question is addressed to the applicant.

<<4466.09;4496.12;en>>
What does the applicant think about Baroness Hale's remark in Al-Jedda that international humanitarian law does not displace international human rights law, but it qualifies international human rights law, in the sense that restrictions to the European Convention rights can be applied that are not foreseen in the European Convention?

<<4499.16;4519.09;en>>
And insofar, the courts, these courts, we need is limited to control of the exercise of proportionality in the application of these rights.

<<4519.09;4534.59;en>>
And my second question, also addressed to the applicant, is about to remark that the civilian was used as a bargaining chip, a bargaining instrument.

<<4534.59;4539.28;en>>
I would like you to elaborate a little bit further on this topic.

<<4539.28;4548.84;en>>
What is, in substance, the evidence that you can produce before us to sustain this statement?

<<4548.84;4548.84;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4550.21;4552.29;en>>
Thank you, Judge Pinto de Albuquerque.

<<4552.29;4562.57;en>>
I have myself two questions to both parties, but more specifically also to the respondent government.

<<4562.57;4575.81;en>>
We received on the 9th of September this year observations on the admissibility and merits, and in particular, Annexes A and B.

<<4575.81;4590.53;en>>
Now, Annex B contains proposed additions to statements of facts and incorporates corrections at Annex A together with further facts upon which the applicant proposes to rely.

<<4590.53;4596.37;en>>
Now, I understand that the additions are highlighted by track changes.

<<4596.37;4621.79;en>>
And I would like to refer to paragraph 18 of the amended version, where the applicant says that the government provided the court with a copy of a record of the interview of the 23rd of April, and then which was available to and may have been seen by UK soldiers.

<<4621.79;4632.69;en>>
Now, I understand that this allegation is disputed, if I have read carefully the observations of the government.

<<4632.69;4647.91;en>>
But in this record of the interview, we read, and the applicant's lawyer referred to it already, that the enemy prisoner of war knows that he was brought in because of his brother Resaan.

<<4647.91;4659.23;en>>
And further down, we read that the EPW could know more about his brother's activities in the Ba'ath Party and some of his friends involved in the party, too.

<<4659.23;4665.59;en>>
Using any type of harsh approach is not going to be effective.

<<4665.59;4668.47;en>>
The EPW loves his family and so on.

<<4668.47;4678.75;en>>
EPW will cooperate, but he needs someone he can trust if he's going to tell information about his brother that is going to harm him.

<<4678.75;4684.45;en>>
Now, I would like both parties to comment on that.

<<4684.45;4692.63;en>>
My second question is connected to the statement made by the government.

<<4692.63;4718.71;en>>
The government relied on the case of Al-Saadoon, the judgment of the 2nd of March, 2010, and in particular to paragraph 41 of this judgment to submit that the United States, the American forces, did run the facility at Camp Bucca.

<<4718.71;4733.51;en>>
Do I understand you well that you do rely on paragraph 41 as authority of our court to say that in connection with Camp Bucca, the UK did not fall within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom?

<<4733.51;4739.55;en>>
If you could be precise on that paragraph, please.

<<4739.55;4740.07;en>>
Thank you.

<<4740.07;4742.27;en>>
So there are no further questions.

<<4742.27;4746.39;en>>
So there will now be a break of 20 minutes, generous 20 minutes.

[[Announcer;UNK]]

<<4901.02;4901.58;fr>>
La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4944.57;4948.57;en>>
The hearing is resumed, Mr. Eadie

[[Government;GR1]]

<<4955.01;4957.25;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<4957.25;4960.49;en>>
we've got a lot of questions in a short time.

<<4960.49;4963.05;en>>
I will do the best I can to try and answer them.

<<4963.05;4970.09;en>>
Some of them we may need to check some parts of those questions to try and make sure you have as accurate information as we can possibly give you.

<<4970.09;4979.91;en>>
Some of them, particularly in relation to one question asked by Judge Marnie, may be rather above my pay grade in terms of committing a UK to a particular position on derogation.

<<4979.91;4983.57;en>>
So I may need to check back at head office about that as well.

<<4983.57;4989.93;en>>
But if I can just simply go through the questions and try and weave in whatever reply I have points there, I'll do that if I may.

<<4989.93;4993.25;en>>
Mr. Judge Trycowski asked, first of all,

<<4993.25;5000.97;en>>
about the question of whether or not the UK and the US shared responsibility for status and release.

<<5000.97;5007.17;en>>
I'm told that there was, indeed, some shared responsibility is the short answer to that question.

<<5007.17;5017.45;en>>
We dealt with that point in some detail in our initial observations before the fourth section of the 6th of March, 2012.

<<5017.45;5026.81;en>>
I'm sorry for referring to those, but we've tried very hard in our grand chamber observations to restrict our answers and our observations to the questions asked by the court.

<<5026.81;5030.67;en>>
Some of these points of detail, therefore, were dealt with in the earlier observations.

<<5030.67;5032.27;en>>
The reference, I'm sure you have them on file.

<<5032.27;5033.77;en>>
If not, we can provide another copy.

<<5033.77;5038.65;en>>
But the reference to those obs for this purpose is paragraphs 44 to 55.

<<5038.65;5042.41;en>>
But the short answer is there was some shared responsibility.

<<5042.41;5053.09;en>>
And that's obviously a point of some relevance when you come to consider, which I'm sure underlies the question, whether or not there was full and exclusive control in the UK of that camp.

<<5053.09;5059.93;en>>
But I accept that there was some shared responsibility for both of those matters.

<<5059.93;5074.57;en>>
The next and second question related to the law, which was whether or not when a person was detained for security reasons, should Article V be qualified by GC3 and GC4, and what did that mean?

<<5074.57;5079.81;en>>
I've to some extent made the submissions I wanted to make on that in my opening remarks.

<<5079.81;5098.93;en>>
We do submit as our primary case that there was displacement, by which I mean IHL as the tailored and suitable set of norms governing detention and release are the applicable body of law for good reason of principle.

<<5098.93;5111.57;en>>
But my alternative submission, as you will recall, is even if that is not accepted, we do have the alternative position which says make Article V work to the extent you can to cover this sort of context.

<<5111.57;5128.37;en>>
The one point on which the principles become very difficult to submit is if you try and overlay Article V so as to create in effect inconsistency or unsatisfiable requirements for this sort of context.

<<5128.37;5130.67;en>>
That's the real concern of principle we have.

<<5130.67;5132.97;en>>
But there are a variety of ways of achieving that.

<<5132.97;5146.27;en>>
Now, as I say, I fully recognize the court's case law on Article V, which, for example, in relation to V1 says these restricted bases on which detention might be lawful are restricted and are to be interpreted narrowly.

<<5146.27;5150.77;en>>
So there may be limited scope to where you can go on that.

<<5150.77;5174.21;en>>
But as I say, my fundamental submission on Article V is that it would be incoherent in principle and thoroughly damaging to end up in a place where a state, any Council of Europe state, is involved in military action of this kind abroad, can legitimately under the applicable international law kill someone, but cannot detain because there is no basis.

<<5174.21;5179.17;en>>
That would be an absolutely bizarre position of principle we respectfully submit.

<<5179.17;5182.09;en>>
Those are the two questions from Judge Tryckowska.

<<5182.09;5196.21;en>>
Judge Ziamiti's questions, the first one related to what value should be placed by the court on the ICJ's statements of principle in the Wall case and other cases.

<<5196.21;5198.69;en>>
What inspiration does the court take from that?

<<5198.69;5207.09;en>>
I make it absolutely clear that I'm not at all submitting that the court shouldn't take thorough inspiration from what the ICJ does.

<<5207.09;5210.45;en>>
It is a well-established principle of the convention case law.

<<5210.45;5221.53;en>>
Indeed, it's a principle upon which we positively rely, that you should have regard in interpreting the convention to international law norms established by bodies such as the ICJ.

<<5221.53;5232.05;en>>
My fundamental point of principle is that if you are seeking to achieve harmony between all the various systems of law, that does require a context-specific analysis.

<<5232.05;5236.89;en>>
And so we don't say you shouldn't take inspiration from those judgments.

<<5236.89;5238.49;en>>
You certainly should do.

<<5238.49;5249.25;en>>
What we say about those judgments is that they are not authority for the proposition that in no circumstances can IHL be treated as the lex specialis.

<<5249.25;5264.29;en>>
They are simply authority for the more general proposition that as a general matter, one doesn't end up in a situation where IHL will automatically displace all the provisions of whatever human rights instrument might be applicable.

<<5264.29;5272.01;en>>
Non sequitur, that the principle that those cases stand for, is that you can never have a lex specialis derived from IHL.

<<5272.01;5273.41;en>>
That's our submission.

<<5273.41;5280.57;en>>
So take inspiration by all means, but recognize the generality of the principle which is expanded.

<<5280.57;5291.69;en>>
A second question related to GC3, which groups of combatants identified in Article 4 of GC3 did Mr. Hassan fall into?

<<5291.69;5294.77;en>>
And the answer to that is any or all of them.

<<5294.77;5296.97;en>>
And I don't mean that flippantly.

<<5296.97;5303.09;en>>
He was suspected of a point of his detention and capture.

<<5303.09;5307.21;en>>
The soldiers on the ground simply couldn't make that sort of judgment.

<<5307.21;5318.53;en>>
That's why he was taken back to Camp Bucca for the status to be properly considered by those who knew the relevant and detailed legal norms and could make those judgments.

<<5318.53;5328.85;en>>
You could not possibly have a situation where soldiers on the ground conducting this sort of operation were required to make those detailed, nuanced legal judgments.

<<5328.85;5337.49;en>>
They saw a man in a house of a person they believed to be a general of the Al-Quds Army with an AK-47 assault rifle on a roof.

<<5337.49;5348.69;en>>
And in those circumstances, it's entirely unsurprising, we respectfully submit, that they didn't say, well, hang on a second, which particular paragraph within Article 4 of GC3 are we arresting this person on?

<<5348.69;5352.49;en>>
They're soldiers from the Black Watch responding to a military environment.

<<5352.49;5355.93;en>>
They properly took him into custody on that basis.

<<5355.93;5363.35;en>>
And decisions were thereafter made by those who were qualified to make those sort of legal status judgments.

<<5363.35;5390.09;en>>
The third question related to release and the facts of release and pointed out, as I think one of the other judges' questions also did, that there are discrepancies or some discrepancies in amongst the contemporaneous records, both in relation to the precise date of release and also in relation to the precise location of release.

<<5390.09;5401.49;en>>
I think it was Judge Lopez-Guerra's question about precise location pointing out that it may be a matter of some importance because Unkazar is relatively close and might be thought to be relatively less dangerous.

<<5401.49;5410.41;en>>
The position so far as those records are concerned is that there are some discrepancies between the contemporaneous records.

<<5410.41;5417.65;en>>
That, I'm afraid, also was a matter that we dealt with in a little detail in our observations before the fourth section.

<<5417.65;5425.13;en>>
The relevant paragraphs are 44 to 55 to try to explain how it was that those records came about.

<<5425.13;5444.13;en>>
To take an example, the reference to the 17th of May date being the date for release was as explained in those observations because on that date, a separate sweep through the camp was made and a check was done on who was and who wasn't there, and a record was created on that date.

<<5444.13;5445.33;en>>
But that's the detail of it.

<<5445.33;5453.73;en>>
The detail, as I say, we've tried to explain in those paragraphs of those observations before the fourth section.

<<5453.73;5457.29;en>>
But the reality is that there are some differences.

<<5457.29;5465.21;en>>
My submission to you is that although there are some differences, there are differences which in truth do not centrally impact.

<<5465.21;5472.85;en>>
And it comes to the tail end of the third question, which is effectively to ask GC for safe release.

<<5472.85;5481.01;en>>
Can you really have safe release when you have discrepancies in the contemporaneous records, which I fully understand appears to be the underpinning for that raft of questions.

<<5481.01;5483.77;en>>
And my answer to it is an unequivocal yes.

<<5483.77;5491.77;en>>
It's a yes because although there are those discrepancies, which we frankly acknowledged in our observations, none of those touch the core of it.

<<5491.77;5503.69;en>>
And the core of it here is that it doesn't matter for the purpose of the Article 2, Article 3, or Article 5 arguments, where the release happened on 2, 10, 12, or 17th of May.

<<5503.69;5510.53;en>>
All the contemporaneous records are clear that by mid-May, release had occurred.

<<5510.53;5524.93;en>>
And it's that fact, uncontroversial, uncontroverted upon which we rely to say, well, if you've got release on that date, how is the UK then responsible four months later, 600 miles away, and so on?

<<5524.93;5529.09;en>>
So we do acknowledge the discrepancies.

<<5529.09;5546.93;en>>
Just to come briefly to Judge Lopez-Guerra's question about precise place of release, again, in those paragraphs of our observations before the fourth section, we do come off the fence, if I can put it that way.

<<5546.93;5560.49;en>>
At least to this extent, there are screenshots of release data, I think, for the two dates, the 2nd and the 12th or the 17th.

<<5560.49;5565.73;en>>
And both of those list Umm Qasr as the place of release.

<<5565.73;5569.85;en>>
And so our case is that that is the more likely place of release.

<<5569.85;5581.09;en>>
But we cannot, because there are some other records which at least make reference to Basra, we cannot say for certain, because there are discrepancies in the contemporaneous documents of that kind.

<<5581.09;5600.89;en>>
But again, in relation to that, the critical feature is that it is uncontroversial and uncontroverted that there was release on that date or on or around that date to one or other of those places, more likely, most likely perhaps, 2nd of May and Umm Qasr.

<<5600.89;5612.05;en>>
Then at 106 of the fourth question of Judge Zia-Miti, 106 of GC4 and the obligation to have contact with the family.

<<5612.05;5619.05;en>>
Again, that's addressed in our observations for the fourth section, paragraphs 52 and 68.

<<5619.05;5648.93;en>>
And in relation to paragraph 68 of those observations, we stated that in relation to Tariq Hassan specifically, the statement of Timothy Lester says, at paragraph 6, that the POW Information Bureau, which now and during the conflict in Iraq acted as the UK's National Information Bureau, forwarded details of Tariq's detention to the ICRC on the 25th of July, 2003.

<<5648.93;5656.17;en>>
The statement adds that the record indicates that Tariq did not consent to Iraq being noted.

<<5656.17;5659.37;en>>
The delay is also there explained.

<<5659.37;5670.55;en>>
It was due to a computer update and didn't mean we therefore respectfully submit that there was a breach of that provision of the Geneva Conventions.

<<5670.55;5678.41;en>>
Judge Marni's questions then, the military order calling for the two-stage screening process.

<<5678.41;5691.97;en>>
And the question was, did the two interviews correspond to that process, pointing out that one was by the US and one was by UK agents, and if not, why on his case?

<<5691.97;5697.81;en>>
My submission in relation to that is, or the factual point in relation to that, is that, as I understand it, we'll double check.

<<5697.81;5709.37;en>>
But as I understand it, the position is believed to be, although not certain, that the US interrogators conducted the first and UK interrogators conducted the second of those interviews.

<<5709.37;5723.21;en>>
But that those interrogators, because there were a large number of people flowing through the camp on this basis whose status needed to be determined, those interrogators did share some of their duties.

<<5723.21;5736.69;en>>
Again, in terms of a reference back into the evidence, the relevant reference back is to the witness statement of the major, whose name has been redacted at annex 5 to our grand chamber observations.

<<5736.69;5743.53;en>>
But perhaps the punchline of that point is that there was a two-stage process.

<<5743.53;5749.13;en>>
So whoever conducted it, the process was to determine civilian status, then to determine threat.

<<5749.13;5755.53;en>>
It looks in the interviews as though that was the process that was properly followed.

<<5755.53;5761.17;en>>
Was he detained in a compound set aside for UK detainees?

<<5761.17;5768.65;en>>
I will check in relation to that, and we will confirm this in some of these answers to the court in writing, if we may.

<<5768.65;5781.53;en>>
But I think the position is that the answer to that question is yes, he was so detained in part of a compound set aside for UK detainees.

<<5781.53;5783.93;en>>
Article 15, my learned friend Mr. Otte relied upon

<<5783.93;5787.85;en>>
to some extent, and Judge Marnie has asked a question about it.

<<5787.85;5795.21;en>>
Whether or not the terms of Article 15 allow a state to derogate in this sort of context, that's the bit I said was a bit above my pay grade.

<<5795.21;5801.05;en>>
I don't want to commit the UK to a position on that, only to be shouted at thereafter.

<<5801.05;5814.65;en>>
But the short point I can perhaps make in relation to Article 15 at this stage is that you'll appreciate that our primary position is that they were without the jurisdiction and that Article 5 was displaced.

<<5814.65;5820.85;en>>
But even if not, the short point about Article 15 is that there is still plenty of argument to be had.

<<5820.85;5829.61;en>>
We've had it this morning before this case about how precisely Article 5 does or doesn't apply in this sort of context.

<<5829.61;5838.69;en>>
And whatever else it may be, I'm not trying to formulate a legal test, but whatever else it may be, Article 15 is an action of last resort by states.

<<5838.69;5857.61;en>>
And if there is a possibility that the articles, the substantive articles of the convention, can be made to work in this sort of context, it might be thought that that was quite a compelling reason for not wishing to derogate, given that derogation, as we all know, has to be a necessary step.

<<5857.61;5860.85;en>>
And I'm sure we would confront arguments if we were to have derogated.

<<5860.85;5863.01;en>>
Obviously, you can't do it retrospectively.

<<5863.01;5866.01;en>>
But if we were to have derogated, I'm sure we would have confronted answers.

<<5866.01;5867.65;en>>
Well, why are you doing that now?

<<5867.65;5869.13;en>>
It's not necessary.

<<5869.13;5876.25;en>>
You need first to have the arguments about how the substantive provisions of the convention can or can't be made to work in this sort of context.

<<5876.25;5882.41;en>>
And only if they can't should you, it would have to be in future, derogate from those substantive provisions.

<<5882.41;5890.65;en>>
So I hope that whatever else it may be, that position is at least closer to the heart of the rule of law than jumping to a derogation rather too quickly.

<<5893.37;5897.73;en>>
Judge Lopez-Guerra, I've picked up and dealt with.

<<5897.73;5902.13;en>>
I should perhaps give you one reference into the screens that I mentioned.

<<5902.13;5905.71;en>>
I think they're AA11 at page 163.

<<5905.71;5911.57;en>>
It's I think the screen document, the printout from the computer that I had in mind.

<<5911.57;5922.05;en>>
Judge Nussberger then asked about the significance of the ID tag having been found in the pocket of this individual.

<<5922.05;5928.93;en>>
Again, we'll check what the policy was, whether there was a policy in place about taking back tags on release.

<<5928.93;5937.61;en>>
But my fundamental submission in relation to the tag in the pocket point, which I know Mr. Otte made a bit of play of in his submissions,

<<5937.61;5940.77;en>>
is that it simply doesn't prove anything about anything.

<<5940.77;5942.95;en>>
It doesn't prove anything about release.

<<5942.95;5947.37;en>>
It proves simply that he kept the ID tag.

<<5947.37;5950.57;en>>
Because on any view, he was at that point outside the camp.

<<5950.57;5954.01;en>>
So if there had been a policy to take back, it should have been taken back.

<<5954.01;5956.37;en>>
If not, he still had it with him.

<<5956.37;5970.43;en>>
So my submission in relation to that is that it doesn't in truth advance any sort of case that says, doesn't that tend to demonstrate or tend to suggest that he must have been in the camp for a longer period?

<<5970.43;5982.69;en>>
Not least because the one thing that is absolutely clear on the contemporaneous evidence, and whatever other holes my friend tried to pick in the factual position, he made no headway on this point.

<<5982.69;5993.07;en>>
Whatever else it shows, it shows consistently across a variety of different contemporaneous documents that release occurred in May 2003.

<<5993.07;6001.41;en>>
And once one starts from that position, there is then a very large time gap between there and September, with a body discovered in September.

<<6001.41;6007.33;en>>
The body, no one suggests, could possibly have been, as it were, four months dead.

<<6007.33;6026.01;en>>
So the theory that the UK agents were involved in some way in that killing has to be squared with the unanimity of position found in a variety of different contemporaneous documents that release occurred on whatever precise date in May.

<<6026.01;6034.41;en>>
The president then asked two questions, if I can leave Mr. Otte to deal with Judge Albuquerque's

<<6034.41;6036.29;en>>
questions.

<<6036.29;6041.65;en>>
The first of the questions related to, again, it was a document Mr. Otte relied upon,

<<6041.65;6051.41;en>>
the record that you quoted from, sir, about him being brought in because he was the brother of Hassan, that document.

<<6051.41;6059.25;en>>
Again, the submission that I make about that is that it doesn't actually advance the position at all.

<<6059.25;6065.25;en>>
It doesn't demonstrate or advance a case that he was, in effect, being taken hostage.

<<6065.25;6066.93;en>>
That's the theory.

<<6066.93;6070.05;en>>
Taken hostage, blackmail of the brother to make him give himself up.

<<6070.05;6073.29;en>>
That just simply doesn't support that case at all.

<<6073.29;6089.33;en>>
It is common ground between us that one of the reasons why the soldiers captured him and brought him into detention is because he was the brother of the general in the Al-Quds Army and was found in his house with the assault rifle on the roof.

<<6089.33;6100.69;en>>
So for there to be contemporaneous records that refer to the fact that he was brought in because of his brother doesn't support the case that he was brought in in order to create him as some sort of hostage.

<<6100.69;6119.05;en>>
Indeed, any theory of that kind would have to be squared, and we say it couldn't be, with the fact that he was then interviewed as he was within 36 hours twice, with conclusions being drawn very quickly that he was a civilian and not a threat, and was then cleared for release.

<<6119.05;6130.05;en>>
How, it may be asked, does that position, how can that position possibly be squared with a theory that is now being peddled that he was taken hostage for the purpose of blackmailing his brother?

<<6130.05;6132.21;en>>
If that has happened, why not keep him?

<<6132.21;6135.57;en>>
It just simply makes no sense whatever and cannot be squared with the documents.

<<6135.57;6141.17;en>>
Even on the face of that document, my submission is that it doesn't advance that case.

<<6141.17;6156.13;en>>
It simply demonstrates a fact that is common ground, which was that a part of the reason he was brought in was because he was the brother of the person believed, accurately as it appears, to be a general in the Al-Quds Army.

<<6156.13;6168.89;en>>
The second question the President asked is whether we rely on the paragraph in the Al-Sidun judgment, paragraph 41, and the answer to that, you won't be surprised to hear, is yes, we do.

<<6168.89;6174.25;en>>
Can I just check whether there's anything very, very briefly I wish to say by way of reply?

<<6174.25;6178.53;en>>
I think I've probably picked up most of it in relation to that, perhaps two points.

<<6178.53;6184.69;en>>
One in relation to jurisdiction and effective control of the area upon which Mr. Otte relied

<<6184.69;6188.29;en>>
as one alternative for establishing jurisdiction.

<<6188.29;6192.89;en>>
It's a point which is of some considerable significance because, as you know, Mr. Shiner's firm

<<6192.89;6199.13;en>>
represent lots of Iraqis before the British courts who are seeking investigations and damages.

<<6199.13;6205.33;en>>
And these sorts of issues about jurisdiction are of considerable broader relevance for those cases.

<<6205.33;6209.77;en>>
And I do not want it to go by default, the effective control of the area point.

<<6209.77;6253.21;en>>
The reason I particularly don't want it to go by default is because when you go back to the relevant principles expanded by the Grand Chamber in Al-Skhaini, you will recall that when you came to deal with effective control of the area, one of the major distinctions between that basis of jurisdiction and state agent authority and control is that under the ECA head, the effective control of the area head, the Grand Chamber said the consequence of jurisdiction is established on that basis is that all the rights in the convention have to be secured to those who fall within the jurisdiction as compared to the divided and tailored approach that you get from state agent authority and control.

<<6253.21;6271.45;en>>
And we respectfully submit, therefore, that demonstrates both the importance of the basis on which you find jurisdiction, but it also serves to demonstrate the need to be thoroughly cautious before finding jurisdiction on an effective control of the area basis.

<<6271.45;6281.09;en>>
I put it that way because you'll recall that Al-Skhaini and the House of Lords, they were deeply worried about the practicalities of the consequence of jurisdiction being found.

<<6281.09;6290.91;en>>
If it was that all convention rights had to be secured, that in itself will tell you a lot about the jurisdictional concept you're dealing with.

<<6290.91;6303.17;en>>
You cannot have a concept of jurisdiction that requires states to afford the rights and freedoms in the convention in circumstances where they simply cannot practically do so.

<<6303.17;6304.61;en>>
And that was exactly the position.

<<6304.61;6311.13;en>>
Whatever else you may decide about state agent authority control, that was exactly the position one was dealing with in Iraq.

<<6311.13;6327.05;en>>
You have, in that respect, all the evidence from the domestic courts who considered that very submission ECA in relation to Iraq and found the series of facts that we've set out in our observations before this court at paragraph 73.

<<6327.05;6346.53;en>>
In a nutshell, Lord Justice Brooke saying that it will be, as he put it, utterly unreal to suggest the United Kingdom is in effective control of the area even after the 1st of May when they became an occupying power, so as to be able to provide all of the guarantees that that basis of jurisdiction would entail.

<<6346.53;6360.17;en>>
And Lord Justice Sedley saying that at that stage after May 2003, the British forces were, in effect, only, as he put it, holding the fragile line against anarchy in Iraq.

<<6360.17;6362.89;en>>
That is not effective control of an area.

<<6362.89;6368.49;en>>
But we urge the court to exercise real caution in that respect.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<6373.06;6377.14;en>>
Mr. Eadie, may I ask you to conclude?

[[Government;GR1]]

<<6377.37;6379.01;en>>
I'm done, Mr. President, I'm done.

<<6379.01;6383.73;en>>
I'm sorry I've gone over, but there were a lot of questions to try and deal with.

<<6383.73;6384.73;en>>
I hope I've dealt with them as shortly as possible.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<6385.31;6387.31;en>>
Thank you very much indeed. Mr. Otty, please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<6387.94;6391.84;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<6391.84;6399.94;en>>
I'll address, if I may, some of the questions raised generally, and of course those specifically directed to me.

<<6399.94;6402.48;en>>
Judge Trzaska first.

<<6402.48;6408.3;en>>
The question was, which state was responsible for detention and release here?

<<6408.3;6413.34;en>>
On the fact of Tarek Hassan's case, the position is crystal clear.

<<6413.34;6418.6;en>>
Detention and release were the responsibility of the UK.

<<6418.6;6423.54;en>>
Decisions to detain and decisions to release were made by the UK.

<<6423.54;6434.58;en>>
The second question, which goes to the heart of a number of the questions raised, should Article 5 be displaced or qualified by reference to IHL?

<<6434.58;6444.26;en>>
The answer to that, and the entirely coherent, principled answer is, only through the gateway of Article 15.

<<6444.26;6450.66;en>>
If you derogate lawfully, you can avoid all the practical problems that Mr. Eadie complains

<<6450.66;6452.04;en>>
about.

<<6452.04;6458.12;en>>
You maintain the principled position that this Court is upholding the rights in the Convention.

<<6458.12;6466.26;en>>
And in testing the lawfulness of the extent of the derogation, you can, of course, have regard to IHL.

<<6466.26;6497.54;en>>
But to suggest that a Convention which refers in terms to how a high-contracting party is to respond to a state of war, to suggest that the appropriate response to that is to say, well, we'll ignore that provision, we'll go to war, and then we'll argue for lesser rights, is, with great respect, not a proper approach to take as a matter of conventional construction of any instrument, let alone one with the protective purpose of this Convention.

<<6497.54;6500.18;en>>
Judge Ziemeler next.

<<6500.18;6508.46;en>>
The importance to attach to the ICJ's approach, we, of course, say, as I've already submitted, very considerable indeed.

<<6508.46;6519.08;en>>
The ICJ, of course, again emphasizing precisely the same principled analysis referable to derogation that I found my case upon.

<<6519.08;6529.32;en>>
And though put with characteristic charm, not good enough, we say respectfully, for the United Kingdom to say, we need to think about that question.

<<6529.32;6543.9;en>>
That issue has been at the heart of the way this case has been put, and understandably at the heart of the way this case has been put, because of the wording of the Convention.

<<6543.9;6549.56;en>>
Judge Mahoney raised one factual question, which Mr. Eadie has said the government will

<<6549.56;6553.02;en>>
make further submissions upon or seek to check the position.

<<6553.02;6560.04;en>>
But we agree that on the evidence, undoubtedly, Mr. Hassan was detained, at least for part

<<6560.04;6564.96;en>>
of the time, in a UK JFIT compound.

<<6564.96;6570.94;en>>
That's evident from the evidence of Major Wilson and indeed Major X.

<<6570.94;6577.68;en>>
The question of legal principle that Judge Mahoney raised is, of course, the Article 15 question.

<<6577.68;6580.68;en>>
And I've already made my submissions on that clear.

<<6580.68;6593.4;en>>
But I'd like to give one additional reference, if I may, to the jurisprudence of the European Commission of Human Rights in the Cyprus against Turkey case, which is referred to in the submissions before the Court.

<<6593.4;6612.36;en>>
At paragraph 519 of the Commission's report, the observation is made that once jurisdiction is made out, even on an extraterritorial basis, then it is open to the state vested with that jurisdiction to derogate.

<<6612.36;6625.36;en>>
And the observation is made in the context of Turkey being the high-contracting party appropriate for consideration of derogation under Article 15 in relation to events in northern Cyprus.

<<6625.36;6639.08;en>>
Now reading across, that principled position again supports our analysis of the route through human rights law and IHL.

<<6639.08;6646.02;en>>
Judge Albuquerque asked two questions of the applicants specifically.

<<6646.02;6662.96;en>>
The first was by reference to Baroness Hale's observations in the Al-Jedda case and the question of the potential for displacement of the Convention or qualification of the Convention.

<<6662.96;6675.34;en>>
Those observations we respectfully submit are specifically focusing upon the potential or otherwise for Security Council resolutions to qualify the Convention.

<<6675.34;6680.6;en>>
The same issue addressed authoritatively by this Court in Al-Jedda.

<<6680.6;6689.16;en>>
They provide no basis for suggesting a qualification simply by reference to IHL of Convention rights.

<<6689.16;6699.44;en>>
And again, the principled coherent response is to say, derogate first and then have regard to IHL.

<<6699.44;6705.96;en>>
Now Mr. Eadie's response on this issue involved the submission that one had to be terribly

<<6705.96;6711.64;en>>
careful about derogation because it was a measure of last resort.

<<6711.64;6721.08;en>>
Well of course engagement in international conflict is a step, one hopes, of last resort.

<<6721.08;6735.72;en>>
And it's a step that would involve consideration of the extent to which both the engagement in that conflict and the consequences which will flow can be compatible with international law.

<<6735.72;6753.74;en>>
And the combination of Article 15 and IHL should have provided a ready guide to the United Kingdom before the 20th of March 2003 and the commencement of operations in Iraq.

<<6753.74;6778.94;en>>
It obviously would have been anticipated that if that commencement of operations went well, the United Kingdom would swiftly find itself in a position where it would be detaining individuals, to put it another way, exercising a classic means of bringing individuals within the jurisdiction of the European Convention on Human Rights.

<<6778.94;6784.84;en>>
The practical problems which Mr. Eadie understandably relies upon would then have had to be considered.

<<6784.84;6791.76;en>>
What do we do about Article 5 and the principle of strict construction and the limited grounds for detention?

<<6791.76;6795.56;en>>
What do we do about the other qualified rights in the Convention?

<<6795.56;6801.24;en>>
Well the answer, if you're in a time of war, is you can derogate.

<<6801.24;6824.16;en>>
And then it's up to this court and the domestic courts to scrutinize the lawfulness of that derogation, but it does so in a logically coherent way and it would test, for example, whether the use of lethal force was indeed lethal force compatible with the laws of war and it would test whether detentions were compatible with IHL.

<<6824.16;6843.72;en>>
And if the answer to either of those hypothetical questions was no, then the derogation would be held to be unlawful because, as I sought to submit in my opening submissions, the Geneva Convention provides a safety net below which in no circumstances can a state's conduct fall.

<<6843.72;6852.36;en>>
The second question of Judge Albuquerque was to ask for the applicant's evidence on the question of bargaining chip.

<<6852.36;6884.32;en>>
Now the words bargaining chip are taken from the Essex Human Rights Center intervention, as I've already indicated, but in terms of the evidence, and it's important to focus the stage at which this evidential inquiry is focused, in terms of the evidence for the motivation behind the initial detention, the evidence is that a neighbor of Tarek Hassan's was told shortly after the detention had occurred that Mr. Hassan was being kept until the applicant

<<6884.32;6886.16;en>>
surrendered himself.

<<6886.16;6892.64;en>>
That's Mr. Alubodi, tab two of the applicant's core documents.

<<6892.64;6899.84;en>>
Similarly the applicant's sisters, indeed Mr. Hassan's sisters, were told that the applicant

<<6899.84;6904.94;en>>
had to surrender himself in order for Mr. Hassan to be released.

<<6904.94;6908.72;en>>
That's tab one, the statement of the applicant.

<<6908.72;6920.54;en>>
Now we don't know what happened after that, and we don't know what was in the mind of the soldiers who detained Mr. Hassan in the first place.

<<6920.54;6942.48;en>>
And one reason we don't know that is that the Black Watch document relied upon as the cornerstone of the government's case as explaining the circumstances of what happened was only produced ten years on in redacted form and without a single statement from any of that unit being taken.

<<6942.48;6956.76;en>>
And that alone illustrates, we say vividly, why there is a compelling need for an independent investigation in this case.

<<6956.76;6963.52;en>>
Finally the President's question as to the significance of the passages in the U.S. interview

<<6963.52;6965.96;en>>
record.

<<6965.96;6972.4;en>>
We of course, as I've already indicated, place considerable significance on those observations.

<<6972.4;6979.12;en>>
And it was notable that in his reply to the President, Mr. Eadie addressed only the first

<<6979.12;6981.2;en>>
of the observations.

<<6981.2;6994.34;en>>
And he said nothing about the second passage that the President put to him, indicating that clear consideration was being given as to how the relationship between Mr. Hassan

<<6994.34;7000.82;en>>
and his brother could be exploited for intelligence-gathering purposes.

<<7000.82;7009.32;en>>
There could be no justification in human rights law or IHL for that kind of conduct either.

<<7009.32;7016.0;en>>
Mr. President, subject to reserving the applicant's position to reply to any further written submissions

<<7016.0;7020.56;en>>
that the government seeks to put before the court, those are the only submissions we would seek to make.

La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<57.19;63.23;en>>
Please be seated, I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of Pentikäinen  against Finland.

<<63.23;74.67;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on the 19th of February, 2010, under Article 34 of the Convention by a Finnish national, Mr. Markus Veikko Pentikäinen.

<<74.67;83.35;en>>
It was allocated to the fourth section of the court, pursuant to Rule 52, Paragraph 1 of the Rules of Court.

<<83.35;98.07;en>>
On the 4th of February, 2014, the chamber of the fourth section declared the application admissible and found by five votes to two that there had been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention.

<<98.07;112.59;en>>
On the 30th of April, 2014, the applicant requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention, and the panel of the Grand Chamber accepted his request on the 2nd of June, 2014.

<<112.59;121.55;en>>
The Finnish government are represented by their agent, Mr. Arto Kosonen, Director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<215.26;218.94;en>>
Dear Mr. President and distinguished members of the Court,

<<218.94;229.3;en>>
We have recently seen conflicts in the Member States of the Convention, where journalists have risked their safety and even their lives for media freedom.

<<229.3;238.38;en>>
The Court has often noted that a journalist plays an eminent role as the public watchdog of the government.

<<238.38;248.26;en>>
Only a journalist can gather and impart real-time information and cover both sides of a story when the government is a counterparty.

<<248.26;257.36;en>>
The earlier Chamber judgments on this particular case shocked journalists within and beyond the states of the Convention.

<<257.36;268.24;en>>
The European Federation of Journalists and the International Federation of Journalists decided to support the applicant's submission to the panel of the Grand Chamber.

<<268.24;285.6;en>>
The Grand Chamber now will have the opportunity to set a standard for how journalists should be treated in extreme situations and to what extent the state can intervene in the journalistic work and the public's right to access to information.

<<285.6;296.54;en>>
I would like to summarize briefly the circumstances and the facts in the light of the government's written submission and the Chamber's judgment.

<<296.54;302.8;en>>
The SMAS-ASEM demonstration in Skiasma Square attracted extensive media attention.

<<302.8;311.9;en>>
The applicant was sent by his employer, Suomen Kuvalehti, to gather and impart information from the area.

<<311.9;319.84;en>>
The employer publishes a prestigious publication that focuses on social issues.

<<319.84;328.62;en>>
The magazine aimed to make in-depth analyses of the social issues brought to the light by the demonstration.

<<328.62;336.6;en>>
Therefore it was necessary that the applicant was in the scene until the very end of the demonstration.

<<336.6;349.22;en>>
Some 500 bystanders, a core group up to 50 demonstrators, and some 50 journalists gathered at Skiasma Square, which was the departure point of the march.

<<349.22;356.84;en>>
The police had made security preparations for the event by deploying 480 police officers.

<<356.84;363.96;en>>
By Finnish standards, the scale of police preparations was exceptional.

<<363.96;371.2;en>>
Police announced that the march would not be allowed, but a peaceful demonstration could be held in front of Skiasma Square.

<<371.2;377.6;en>>
The police formed a police line and did not allow protesters to leave.

<<377.6;385.6;en>>
After that, a core group of about 15 protesters tried to break through the police line.

<<385.6;393.56;en>>
The police ended the demonstration and cordoned off Skiasma Square after 30 minutes from the start of the event.

<<393.56;404.36;en>>
First nobody was allowed to leave the cordoned area, and after an hour police formed some checkpoints which the people could use to leave the area.

<<404.36;414.1;en>>
The situation developed in such a way that the applicant's interest focused on the seemingly excessive force and actions of the police.

<<414.1;423.68;en>>
The police had detained bystanders with excessive force and some without any lawful reason.

<<423.68;441.4;en>>
Because the sudden actions of the police were provocative, controversial and questionable, the applicant saw that as a member of press he had to remain at the scene to gather and impart information for the public which they have a right to receive.

<<441.4;447.2;en>>
As the court has noted in the Törköyhti vs. Iceland, excess conduct of the police

<<447.2;453.32;en>>
is looked on as a serious public concern.

<<453.32;459.92;en>>
The government has stated that their security preparations for the demonstration were justified.

<<459.92;468.68;en>>
The government has also noted that they had to secure the security of citizens and put an end to the demonstration.

<<468.68;473.92;en>>
Indeed the applicant also accepts the view of the government.

<<473.92;478.48;en>>
The applicant has never contested this fact.

<<478.48;488.88;en>>
However, the government failed to secure the applicant's right to freedom of expression.

<<488.88;505.68;en>>
Additionally it is unclear to the applicant why the government has sent DVD video footage to the court from other violent incidents that happened on another day and therefore have no relevance to the present case.

<<505.68;520.04;en>>
I would like to draw the court's attention that the case is lodged for the violation of Article 10 of the Convention and not the Article 11 of the Convention which the government seems to be referring.

<<520.04;523.72;en>>
Now I move on the violation of Article 10 of the Convention.

<<523.72;529.72;en>>
Article 10 of the Convention guarantees that everyone has freedom of expression.

<<529.72;535.84;en>>
Freedom of expression consists of gathering, imparting and publishing information.

<<535.84;540.88;en>>
The right can be subject to conditions and restrictions.

<<540.88;546.44;en>>
The court has noted in Sunday Times vs. the United Kingdom that the eminent role of the

<<546.44;556.2;en>>
press in democratic society is to impart ideas and opinions on political matters and other matters of public interest.

<<556.2;567.52;en>>
Strong reasons must be provided for any measure affecting this role of the press and limiting access to information which the public has right to receive.

<<567.52;573.08;en>>
As the court has noted in Observer and Guardian vs. the United Kingdom, the number of exceptions

<<573.08;576.96;en>>
must be narrowly interpreted.

<<576.96;586.56;en>>
The court has established a three-stage test to verify that the limiting of freedom of expression is justified.

<<586.56;593.36;en>>
First it has to be established interference to the freedom of expression has occurred.

<<593.36;604.88;en>>
As the Chamber has correctly noted, the presumption exists that there was an interference because the applicant was on the scene as a journalist.

<<604.88;611.84;en>>
During the detention, the applicant could not impart real-time information to the publisher's website.

<<611.84;626.16;en>>
Just after the apprehension, the applicant wanted to give the memory cards from his cameras to his colleague to ensure that the people would have access to this information right away, but the police did not allow this.

<<626.16;634.38;en>>
In other words, the applicant's journalistic sources were confiscated for the period of detention.

<<634.38;645.24;en>>
The applicant was not only removed from the scene and detained overnight, but was also charged by a prosecutor and convicted by the District Court of Helsinki.

<<645.24;651.4;en>>
Indeed it is quite clear that there was interference in his journalistic work.

<<651.4;655.92;en>>
Mr. President, if you allow, my colleague Mr. Mattilainen would now describe the second

<<655.92;658.36;en>>
stage of the verification as to whether the interference was prescribed by Finnish law.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<663.28;665.6;en>>
Yes, thank you, Mr. Matilainen.

[[Applicant;AP3]]

<<672.56;677.24;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<677.24;682.48;en>>
the applicant holds a view according to which the state interference described by Mr. Salokangas

<<682.48;688.88;en>>
has not been prescribed by Finnish domestic law enforced during the relevant time.

<<688.88;704.4;en>>
First of all, at the outset, I would like to mention that few crucial sections of domestic law were not referred before the four chamber, at least not with the same diligence as they have now been brought forth in the applicant's written submissions.

<<704.4;723.08;en>>
The applicant considers that he has had the right to supplement the facts, first of all, because they are facts by nature to which the whole case should be founded in the first place, and secondly, because it is the state's first and foremost duty to know the relevant content of its own legislation.

<<723.08;730.0;en>>
Moreover, the state should have taken into account also the facts that speak on behalf of the applicant.

<<730.0;745.86;en>>
Now, as for the domestic law, according to the Constitution of Finland, the Assembly Act, and the Police Act, the duty of the police is to maintain a public order and for this purpose to give necessary instructions and orders.

<<745.86;757.96;en>>
The term necessary within the aforementioned legislation implies that while performing this duty, all competing basic rights needs to be taken into account with due regard.

<<757.96;769.16;en>>
Moreover, under the Constitution of Finland, everyone, even journalists, are equal before the law, as the government has correctly observed in its written submissions.

<<769.16;776.44;en>>
It cannot nevertheless be presumed that formal equality shall overrule every other basic right possibly at stake.

<<776.44;792.12;en>>
In fact, by referring to equality in this context and in this particular case, the state seems to admit that it has not even tried to take into consideration the basic right of freedom of expression as executed by the applicant.

<<792.12;810.86;en>>
Nonetheless, the applicant admits that it might not be an easy task to make such a necessity assessment between competing basic rights, for example, in protests, where masses of people behave aggressively and where events might transform rapidly.

<<810.86;821.8;en>>
However, the smash as a demonstration in general can hardly be described as such an event, as we have seen from the documentation attached to the applicant's written submissions.

<<821.8;831.72;en>>
Moreover, at least at the time of applicant's apprehension, the protest was already quelled, even if some protesters were still left at the scene.

<<831.72;847.92;en>>
In your court's precedent, Giselle versus Switzerland, the national authorities' conduct, by which they had not made any kind of distinction between potentially violent individuals and peaceful demonstrators, was regarded as not prescribed by local domestic law.

<<847.92;856.6;en>>
The Finnish government has also observed in its written submissions that the reason for the applicant's arrest did not turn on his acting as a photographer.

<<856.6;882.36;en>>
However, in this context, one must bear in mind your court's case of Nechafli versus Azebaijan, where, irrespective of the police's true intention to interfere with the applicant's journalist activity, relevance was given to the journalist's clear efforts to identify himself as a journalist and to the fact that the journalist was simply doing his work and observing the event.

<<882.36;894.52;en>>
In the present case, it is indisputable that the applicant was not part of a demonstration and that he conducted himself in a peaceable manner during the events in question.

<<894.52;919.04;en>>
Even if the somewhat questionable declaration by the police to consider the smash as a demonstration as a riot would be deemed to remain within the member state's margin of appreciation, the decision of the police after this declaration to categorically apprehend everyone left at the scene, whether or not they were involved in violent acts, has not been necessary.

<<919.04;935.56;en>>
It has also been evident for the police that the applicant was a journalist performing his journalistic tasks and that he was not a threat to public order nor to any individual security that would have required to apprehend the applicant.

<<935.56;946.76;en>>
The circumstances being such, the applicant's apprehension was not necessary for the sake of public order and as such not prescribed by domestic law either.

<<946.76;959.44;en>>
At least the general criminal law principle of minimum intervention should have required the police, instead of apprehension, to order the applicant to present himself for interrogation at a later date.

<<959.44;966.32;en>>
However, the applicant was apprehended for contumacy towards the police for about 18 hours.

<<966.32;982.24;en>>
According to the Pretrial Investigation Act, a suspect who has not been arrested needs to be present in the criminal investigation for longer than 12 hours at the time unless the prerequisites for an arrest are met.

<<982.24;988.16;en>>
If the prerequisites for an arrest are met, a suspect needs to be released in 24 hours at the latest.

<<991.08;1004.56;en>>
The prerequisites for an arrest are set out in the Coercive Measures Act, according to which the suspect may be arrested for an offense where the most severe penalty exceeds imprisonment for one year.

<<1004.56;1007.28;en>>
Now, what is relevant here?

<<1007.28;1017.64;en>>
Only the offense of rioting but not contumacy towards the police is such a criminal act, and therefore, permitting the police to arrest the suspect.

<<1017.64;1027.12;en>>
In this context, one cannot either emphasize too much that the time limits for any kind of coercive measures are only maximum limits.

<<1027.12;1037.56;en>>
And while applying them, the authorities need always to take into account the principle of minimum intervention on behalf of an individual.

<<1037.56;1059.8;en>>
Given the applicant's clearly and visibly peaceful conduct during the demonstration and his clear and successful efforts to identify himself as a journalist, no evidence of any kind whatsoever of him having rioted existed at any time that might have justified his arrest or prolonging the apprehension for over 12 hours.

<<1062.92;1075.64;en>>
It is worth pointing out also that interrogating a suspect between 10 PM and 7 AM was legal during the relevant time if suspect was only to request this.

<<1075.64;1087.64;en>>
In current case, the applicant had indeed made clear for the authorities his will to be interrogated as soon as possible from the very beginning of his detention.

<<1087.64;1095.96;en>>
For these reasons, the detention of the applicant for about 18 hours was not prescribed by domestic law.

<<1095.96;1107.64;en>>
Thirdly and lastly, the district court's decision was not reasoned sufficiently, a failure which is contrary to the Finnish criminal procedural act.

<<1107.64;1117.28;en>>
As a member of the European Convention on Human Rights, the Finnish courts are obliged to be familiar with the convention's content and to apply all the case law related to it.

<<1121.08;1132.48;en>>
Concerning the question as to whether the interference had been necessary in a democratic society, the district court came only to a laconic conclusion according to which the interference had been necessary.

<<1132.48;1145.48;en>>
This decision was nevertheless made without drawing any kind of distinction whatsoever between the different competing interests as required by the convention, but also directly by the domestic law itself.

<<1145.48;1157.84;en>>
Hence, for the applicant and for the public, it has not been clear at all on what legal reasoning the judgment was based and what was the pressing social need for the state interference.

<<1157.84;1165.08;en>>
Therefore, neither the district court decision, as manifestly unsubstantiated, was prescribed by domestic law.

<<1165.08;1184.56;en>>
In any case, and regardless whether or not your court would consider the interference concern as prescribed by domestic law, the applicant requests that your court would take into consideration the government's said actions, also by asking itself whether the government said whether the applicant's treatment has been necessary in a democratic society.

<<1184.56;1186.88;en>>
I will ask my colleague Mr. Salogangas to continue next

<<1186.88;1188.0;en>>
on this theme.

<<1188.0;1188.0;en>>
Thank you.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<1196.63;1199.51;en>>
Dear Mr. President and distinguished members of the Court,

<<1199.51;1208.43;en>>
now I would like to move to the third stage of the certification assessment as to whether the action was necessary in a democratic society.

<<1208.43;1219.19;en>>
The Chamber has noted that a separate area was reserved for the representatives of the media so they could freely and safely cover the event in question.

<<1219.19;1224.71;en>>
However, this claim is dismantled for following reasons.

<<1224.71;1230.79;en>>
First of all, reasoning of the majority of the Chamber should be rejected.

<<1230.79;1240.87;en>>
It is not up to the government to decide the viewpoint of a journalist's story or the angle of close-up photograph.

<<1240.87;1250.83;en>>
This kind of reasoning would allow pre-censorship in member states of the Convention if use of the area is obligatory.

<<1250.83;1259.35;en>>
Such media areas would be always established in conflict zones where violence clashes might occur.

<<1259.35;1267.55;en>>
As judges have stated in their dissenting opinion, the area should have been optional for use.

<<1267.55;1275.35;en>>
The government has clarified in their written submission that the media area was actually in the Pasikivi Square.

<<1275.35;1286.39;en>>
After the government's written submission to the Grand Chamber, it is now the first time that the journalist and the applicant have been made aware of the media area.

<<1286.39;1294.75;en>>
The Union of Journalists in Finland contacted all the main media houses and asked if anyone had been in the area.

<<1294.75;1299.35;en>>
Many journalists who were on the scene responded to the request of the Union.

<<1299.35;1301.11;en>>
Their message was clear.

<<1301.11;1306.99;en>>
Nobody was in the claimed area, and nobody even knew about it.

<<1306.99;1325.27;en>>
This is confirmed by many journalists, for example, those representing the newspaper with the biggest circulation in the Nordic region, Helsinki-Sanomat, and by those representing the Finnish National Broadcasting Company, which is comparable to the BBC.

<<1325.27;1334.59;en>>
Moreover, every journalist who was at the scene told that at no time they were actually instructed to enter the claimed media area.

<<1334.59;1340.91;en>>
If the area was formed, why didn't the police try to instruct the applicant or any other journalist to enter it?

<<1344.59;1349.71;en>>
The Pasikivi Square is about 100 meters away from the coordinate area.

<<1349.71;1359.31;en>>
The government has asserted for the first time that the visibility to the Kiasma Square was partly blocked from time to time.

<<1359.31;1372.71;en>>
However, the visibility from this area was not only partly blocked, but completely, by police buses, minibuses, and multilayered police lines, as the videos and pictures show.

<<1375.91;1392.79;en>>
As judges have noted in their dissenting opinion, photo journalists could not mingle with the demonstrators in order to get a better understanding of events and obtain statements from the participants or take close-up photos.

<<1392.79;1401.83;en>>
In this context, one must bear in mind that the peaceful demonstrators should have a right to express their opinions.

<<1401.83;1409.53;en>>
The media's role is to gather and impart those opinions to the public.

<<1409.53;1430.55;en>>
The government has clarified in the submission that this area contained a senior officer from the Helsinki Police District's Public Relations Unit, who was present to answer any questions media representatives might have had, as well as to give interviews on the events that unfolded during the day.

<<1430.55;1440.19;en>>
However, the media cannot work as a watchdog of the government if a journalist is able to make interviews only given by the authorities.

<<1440.19;1445.23;en>>
It cannot be adequate if only authorities can present their view of the events to the media.

<<1445.23;1456.55;en>>
As the government has described in their written submission, the police used so-called paint-and-chain methods and did not let anyone enter or go outside the cordon.

<<1456.55;1463.47;en>>
During the event, the policemen actively compressed the cordon so that it contained a smaller area.

<<1463.47;1468.87;en>>
Only for the first half an hour of the demonstration could the journalists move freely in the area.

<<1468.87;1486.15;en>>
The chamber has made an unsubstantiated finding that it was not clear to the government that the applicant was a journalist.

<<1486.15;1490.59;en>>
The applicant was given an order to disperse around 9 o'clock.

<<1490.59;1501.87;en>>
However, he informed the police that he was a journalist after which he was left alone, according to the merits of the district court of Helsinki.

<<1501.87;1509.23;en>>
After that, he made a call to his employer to ask whether he should stay or leave the area.

<<1509.23;1519.11;en>>
This is a standard procedure since the employer has duties such as taking care of the occupational safety of an employee.

<<1519.11;1528.99;en>>
The Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Act requires that the employee should make the employer aware of the security risks.

<<1528.99;1541.79;en>>
After a phone call with the employer, it was clear that the applicant should remain at the scene to be a public watchdog of the government and to impart information to the public.

<<1541.79;1547.99;en>>
The applicant was apprehended after he heard the command, detained a photographer.

<<1547.99;1554.19;en>>
The police officer who apprehended him has given a statement in the preliminary investigation.

<<1554.19;1564.59;en>>
I would like to endorse that the statement is based on a most recent hearing after the event where he had official responsibility by the criminal law to be truthful.

<<1564.59;1568.91;en>>
I'll quote the statement for you.

<<1568.91;1573.23;en>>
The applicant was in process of taking photographs within the cordon.

<<1573.23;1576.15;en>>
I apprehended him according to orders.

<<1576.15;1578.07;en>>
He did not resist in any way.

<<1578.07;1585.39;en>>
He asked why he was being arrested to which I replied that this was not an arrest but an apprehension.

<<1585.39;1590.23;en>>
He asked permission to make a call and this was allowed.

<<1590.23;1595.39;en>>
When I asked the applicant for identification, he presented a press card.

<<1595.39;1600.87;en>>
He said he was a journalist but I don't remember for which paper.

<<1600.87;1608.75;en>>
Then I filled out the apprehension form and passed him to another squad, end of quote.

<<1608.75;1617.15;en>>
Additionally to the applicant's identification as a journalist, he was in possession of heavy camera gear consisting of two cameras.

<<1617.15;1624.67;en>>
He had been peacefully photographing the event and did not in any way participate in the demonstration.

<<1624.67;1636.03;en>>
In the district court of Helsinki, the witness Helminen had seen the applicant wearing a press badge just before exiting the cordon some minutes before the applicant's apprehension.

<<1636.03;1641.87;en>>
It has to be noted that the applicant did not fail to identify himself in the custody facilities.

<<1641.87;1650.27;en>>
As he has described in his article, he had shouted constantly to the passing police officers that he was a journalist.

<<1650.27;1661.99;en>>
By law, the police will receive the applicant at custody room, has to confiscate all personal belongings before passing the apprehended to an actual detention cell.

<<1661.99;1676.19;en>>
This means that the police officer will receive the applicant at custody room, became aware that the applicant was a journalist from the press badge which he had to confiscate for the detention time.

<<1676.19;1685.43;en>>
The applicant has sent pictures to the court showing demonstrations, sitting down and holding their hands at the end of the demonstration.

<<1685.43;1693.75;en>>
In another picture which was taken sometime earlier, the demonstrators are smiling and showing peace signs.

<<1693.75;1707.47;en>>
The applicant's role to the end was to take part in discussion as to whether there really was a riot as the police had claimed from the beginning and whether the conduct of the police was justified.

<<1707.47;1719.43;en>>
The applicant could not have gathered and imparted this kind of information to the public if he had followed the orders of the police and left the area in the first place.

<<1719.43;1726.27;en>>
The public would have been deprived of their right to be told another side of the story.

<<1726.27;1734.87;en>>
In addition, the voice of the peaceful demonstrators could not have been heard if the applicant did not remain at the scene.

<<1734.87;1739.83;en>>
Journalists in Finland are strictly following the ethical guidelines.

<<1739.83;1749.79;en>>
The Finnish ethical guidelines for journalists require that the journalist is free from influences, including those practiced by the government.

<<1749.79;1759.71;en>>
Normally, the cases of conduct of journalists are dealt with by the Council for Mass Media in Finland and not as a criminal matter.

<<1759.71;1769.11;en>>
The conduct of the authorities might have been justifiable if the event had been chaotic, but it was not.

<<1769.11;1772.23;en>>
The riot had quelled one and a half hours ago.

<<1772.23;1779.95;en>>
The applicant was one of the last ones on the scene and was surrounded by hundreds of policemen.

<<1779.95;1782.95;en>>
It has been never claimed that the applicant was a demonstrator.

<<1782.95;1786.11;en>>
As the Court has noted in Gesell v. Switzerland, the government

<<1786.11;1791.23;en>>
should have made a distinction between a demonstrator and a journalist.

<<1791.23;1795.55;en>>
In Nasafli v. Azerbaijan, the Court noted that the government's

<<1795.55;1805.23;en>>
intention was not relevant if the journalist was only there to assert the event and had identified himself as a journalist.

<<1805.23;1815.55;en>>
In its written submission, the government has noted out the applicant should not have been treated the same way as other members of the crowd were treated.

<<1815.55;1824.11;en>>
This reveals that the government is still not interested in the applicant's status as a journalist.

<<1824.11;1831.99;en>>
As far as for the chilling effects of the applicant's experience, there can be no doubt that this case is chilling by nature.

<<1831.99;1837.47;en>>
This is confirmed by the judges in their dissenting opinion of the case.

<<1837.47;1842.03;en>>
The consequences of what happened to the applicant have to be assessed as a whole.

<<1842.03;1849.39;en>>
The conduct of the applicant was relatively insignificant in proportion to its consequences.

<<1849.39;1854.79;en>>
The applicant was kept overnight in custody for about 18 hours.

<<1854.79;1861.31;en>>
When he was released, the information which he had gathered was no longer a fresh news item.

<<1861.31;1869.31;en>>
Detention in itself has negative implications for the right of freedom of expression.

<<1869.31;1875.75;en>>
Criminal conviction is a grave sanction which every journalist in Finland tries to avoid.

<<1875.75;1880.95;en>>
Such a conviction has a negative effect on the career of a journalist.

<<1880.95;1886.79;en>>
It has to be noted that the applicant had to pay all his legal costs.

<<1886.79;1897.47;en>>
The Chamber has noted that the District Court of Helsinki saw the conduct of the applicant excusable and therefore did not impose any penalty.

<<1897.47;1907.99;en>>
The Chamber reasoned that it was because of the expectations arising from obligations imposed by the police and, on the other hand, by his employer.

<<1907.99;1915.59;en>>
One must bear in mind that almost every media house uses freelance workforce, especially in the conflict zones.

<<1915.59;1920.59;en>>
The freelance journalist does not traditionally have an employer.

<<1920.59;1926.31;en>>
Freelance journalists might be just gathering information by himself for the upcoming article.

<<1926.31;1933.35;en>>
With this kind of reasoning, freelance journalist conduct would not be excusable.

<<1933.35;1938.59;en>>
Journalists in Finland obey strictly the commands given by the police.

<<1938.59;1946.23;en>>
When the demonstration was coming to an end, the applicant was the only journalist at scene.

<<1946.23;1956.91;en>>
Journalists will continue to make effort to avoid such circumstances as long as they are likely to be sanctioned by detention and a criminal conviction.

<<1956.91;1974.11;en>>
This will lead to the situation where journalists cannot play their vital role as a watchdog of the government if the police can give a disproportionate command to a journalist without the adequate reason and, therefore, limit the access to information which the public has right to receive.

<<1977.59;1985.11;en>>
Before I move to the conclusion, I will shortly comment on the legal costs since the government has objected them.

<<1985.11;1992.51;en>>
The applicant's legal costs meet up the level of the national regulation of the Finnish Bar Association.

<<1992.51;2000.99;en>>
National legal aid is just an aid to help persons in low income in the legal costs, but it is not a standard fee for any lawyer in Finland.

<<2004.83;2021.75;en>>
As for the conclusion, I would like to endorse that Finland is a country that appears to have highest level of press freedom rankings according to organizations such as Reporters Without Borders and Human Rights Watch.

<<2021.75;2034.39;en>>
If the press freedom in a modern country permits, journalists will pursue their profession to be apprehended by the police, prosecuted, and convicted of an offense.

<<2034.39;2044.79;en>>
And approval of this practice by the court will send wrong signals about the protection level for journalists in democratic society.

<<2044.79;2053.51;en>>
This would have implication in countries who have less robust protection for freedom of speech.

<<2053.51;2060.99;en>>
The police did not balance their interests properly when apprehending or giving a disperse order to the applicant.

<<2060.99;2066.63;en>>
However, more can be expected of the national courts.

<<2066.63;2077.35;en>>
The district court of Helsinki did not give any reasons or balance interest as to why it was necessary in democratic society to interfere with the applicant's right.

<<2077.35;2085.67;en>>
The national court did not analyze whether the applicant needed to be the watchdog of the government or whether the cheating effect would come in question.

<<2085.67;2092.11;en>>
The applicant tried his best to establish better legal reasoning from the national courts.

<<2092.11;2096.39;en>>
The appeal court of Helsinki did not change the reasoning of the case at all.

<<2096.39;2107.31;en>>
The highest court of Finland did not give any reasons why they would not take up the case, even if it was broadly discussed in Finland and one that said precedent.

<<2107.31;2115.51;en>>
This clearly shows that the Finnish authorities and courts need guidance from the European Human Rights Court.

<<2115.51;2117.43;en>>
Mr. President and distinguished members of the

<<2117.43;2118.69;en>>
court, I thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<2121.38;2123.42;en>>
Thank you very much. I call Mr. Kosonen.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<2132.12;2134.72;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<2134.72;2146.68;en>>
ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning, the government finds it necessary to address two preliminary underlying issues that arise from the applicant's new submissions to the court, to the Grand Chamber.

<<2153.24;2168.72;en>>
Firstly, your court may not entertain accio popularis claims in respect of individuals who have not claimed to be a victim of violation burdened against the United Kingdom in 2008.

<<2168.72;2184.28;en>>
Consequently, the numerous references by the applicant to the actions of the police vis-a-vis SMAS as an event in general are entirely outside of the scope of the present proceedings.

<<2184.28;2187.12;en>>
Indeed, it is the scope.

<<2187.12;2202.68;en>>
Indeed, it is not your court's task to take a stance on the rights enjoyed by a great number of persons in abstracto, but rather to assess the questions pertaining to the present application in concreto.

<<2202.68;2220.8;en>>
Related to the above, the government further laments the number of attempts taken by the applicant to use your court as a court of third thought, or now before your Grand Chamber of, as one may call it, fifth instance.

<<2220.8;2240.88;en>>
Insofar as the applicant's entirely new submissions of this kind may be understood to require the assessment of fresh evidence not presented before the domestic courts, they are to be dismissed as falling out the scope of your court's function, gone against United Kingdom 2000.

<<2240.88;2250.76;en>>
Rather, the government submits that the present case concerns the assessment by your court of the applicant's case and that alone.

<<2250.76;2271.98;en>>
As to the real substance of the present case, the government would like to begin by noting that while it is in agreement with practically all aspects of the Grand Chamber's judgment, it is hard to follow the presumption by the chamber for the existence of an interference with the applicant's right to freedom of expression.

<<2271.98;2288.56;en>>
This presumption by the government warrants a careful deconstruction and reconsideration, which will be done by reiterating the government's consistent stance on the matter, now expressed through two separate arguments.

<<2288.56;2298.36;en>>
Firstly, the police in their crowd-controlling function did not prevent the applicant from covering this mass assault event.

<<2298.36;2313.0;en>>
And secondly, the applicant's conviction, detention, or apprehension did not follow from his conduct as a newspaper photographer or journalist, but from his systematic refusal to obey police orders.

<<2316.36;2325.24;en>>
It is evident that the applicant was able to take pictures right up to the very end of this mass assault event.

<<2325.24;2338.88;en>>
Again, this is explicitly admitted by the applicant, as can be seen from page 62 of the pretrial investigation record and confirmed by his own written account in the event of Suomen Kuvalehti.

<<2342.36;2355.28;en>>
The applicant claims, and I quote again, that the police actively attempted to prevent the applicant from photographing the event by putting their seals and legs in front of his camera.

<<2355.28;2361.12;en>>
And he further refers to the statement of witness aides in the district court.

<<2361.12;2363.84;en>>
This claim is unfounded.

<<2363.84;2384.6;en>>
Referring to applicants' very purposefully edited video evidence, we can see that this supposed active prevention of photography rather appears as the police attempting to secure a safe space in which it can carry out its functions at the situation.

<<2384.6;2396.6;en>>
This view is rendered still stronger when we consider that the video evidence shows a rush of photographers towards the apprehension in question being made.

<<2396.6;2409.36;en>>
The photographers who not only took photos in front of the police cordon, but also lifted the cameras above the police cordon very close to the officers' heads.

<<2409.36;2420.2;en>>
Moreover, annex 9 of the written submissions of the applicant clearly shows that the seals of the police officers in question were transparent.

<<2420.2;2441.36;en>>
Furthermore, the applicant's continuous insinuation that the police made no effort to facilitate journalists' work or to inform them of matters relating to the demonstration, but rather sought to limit the rights of the media, is a leap into blind consensual.

<<2441.36;2456.28;en>>
One opposite example that counters this wild claim can be found in the way in which police had prepared for the demonstration from the point of view of the media by securing a separate area from them.

<<2456.28;2465.68;en>>
This area was located at the Pasekivi Square, opposite from Kiasma on the other side of the Manestehem Street, on the other side of the street.

<<2465.68;2475.76;en>>
The operative head of the police had appointed a senior member of police to act as a media relations contact person at the designated press area.

<<2475.76;2486.4;en>>
Moreover, the planned demonstration march was to pass right in the front of the set pass at Pasekivi Square, where from the media would have had a good view.

<<2486.4;2490.4;en>>
Indeed, a television crew vehicle was there.

<<2490.4;2499.38;en>>
Obviously, none of this meant that the journalists were not able to freely cover the event or potential march from other suitable places.

<<2502.0;2506.28;en>>
These facts, however, are not for the first time contested by the applicant.

<<2506.28;2507.48;en>>
This is surprising.

<<2507.48;2512.16;en>>
They are now for the first time contested by the applicant, and this is surprising.

<<2512.16;2528.2;en>>
Indeed, even in his request for referral to the grand chamber, the applicant stated, and I quote, only journalists who came later to the scene were informed about the area for photographing or filming, end quote.

<<2528.2;2540.2;en>>
Moreover, the applicant himself has stated in his own written account in Suomen Kuvalehti that he came to know of this press area during the district court proceedings.

<<2540.2;2543.96;en>>
Clearly enough, the area was there.

<<2543.96;2562.0;en>>
Still, the applicant now presents as new evidence the written statements of four journalists, of all of whom claim that they were present at the demonstration and were neither aware nor made aware of the existence of the said area.

<<2562.0;2577.36;en>>
Yet despite this assertion, some nine paragraphs later, the applicant modifies his position again and instead claims that the existence of separate press area is unconvincing.

<<2577.36;2589.08;en>>
None of this new evidence produced by the applicant has been verified or tested in the domestic courts, and moreover, is contrary to the actual circumstances of the case.

<<2589.08;2603.6;en>>
Further, the applicant's assertions on the visibility from the separate media area assume that the police at all times planned on exercising such measures as they were forced to do on that day.

<<2603.6;2613.88;en>>
However, such an assumption is false, as the actions that the police took were in reaction to the event turning into a riot.

<<2613.88;2626.46;en>>
A pertinent example to prove this is the fact that the police itself had placed its head of operations vehicle next to the area reserved for the press.

<<2626.46;2642.84;en>>
This is because that area was one where from one may have monitored the start of the entire mass event, which had it not turned into a riot.

<<2642.84;2652.52;en>>
Furthermore, the police had issued a statement concerning these arrangements and sent it to all major media outlets in Finland.

<<2652.52;2665.58;en>>
Individual police officers at the demonstration were also informed via their personal radio headsets of these media arrangements.

<<2665.58;2682.24;en>>
Turning then to the reasons for apprehension of the applicant, it is clear that the applicant was apprehended due to his repeated failure to comply with consistent and clear police orders to leave the event site.

<<2682.24;2692.44;en>>
Further, to avoid any confusion on the matter, there is clear evidence that shows that the applicant was ordered personally by a police officer to leave the event.

<<2695.28;2714.0;en>>
On the basis of all of this above, the government is of the strong view that the applicant's conviction, detention, or apprehension did not follow from his conduct as a newspaper photographer or journalist, but from his systematic refusal to obey police orders.

<<2714.0;2724.32;en>>
Nevertheless, we at the Grand Chamber, to have another opinion on the question of the alleged interference, the government submits the following.

<<2724.32;2728.96;en>>
Mr. President, whereas previously before the chamber

<<2728.96;2740.1;en>>
there existed no real disagreement that the alleged interference was prescribed by law, the situation has now changed markedly.

<<2740.1;2749.8;en>>
The government is appalled by the sea change of legal opinion of which there has been agreement in all instances until now.

<<2753.54;2768.12;en>>
The government recalls that your court is not a court of fourth or fifth instance, nor are the present proceedings instituted in order to try the original domestic criminal case anew.

<<2768.12;2779.62;en>>
In light of the above, the government regretfully is forced to go over a rather large portion of relevant domestic law in detail.

<<2779.62;2783.28;en>>
The appropriate questions under this heading are twofold.

<<2783.28;2791.8;en>>
Firstly, were the apprehension or subsequent 17 and 1 1 detention of the applicant prescribed by law?

<<2791.8;2799.32;en>>
Secondly, was the applicant's conviction for contumacy to the police similarly prescribed by law?

<<2799.32;2813.2;en>>
The latter of these questions, namely that relating to the applicant's conviction, is easily dealt with by referring to the relevant provisions of domestic law enforced at the time as had been explicitly noted by the chamber.

<<2813.2;2838.88;en>>
Moreover, the applicant seems to have forgotten that the very same chapter of police act that he cites confers on the police the right to order a crowd to disperse and apprehend noncompliant persons, contrary to the applicant's later claim that the order of the police for the crowd to disperse was not according to law.

<<2838.88;2854.06;en>>
As to the further question related to the applicant's apprehension, the applicant asserts that the police apprehended him from contumacy towards the police, which then later was changed to a suspicion of rioting.

<<2854.06;2860.26;en>>
This is incorrect and based on a misreading of the pretrial investigation record.

<<2860.26;2869.86;en>>
On page 62 of the set record, one finds an initial summary of the pretrial investigation in respect of the applicant.

<<2869.86;2879.14;en>>
That has been written retrospectively to the initial apprehension and published the 1st of February, 2007.

<<2879.14;2895.3;en>>
On page 262 of the same pretrial investigation record, one finds the initial minutes taken of the applicant's interview on 10th September, 2006.

<<2895.3;2920.86;en>>
Therefore, from this pretrial investigation record, it is clear that the fact of the matter is that the applicant was apprehended on the basis of suspected rioting, which after further investigation into the matter was changed to a suspicion of contumacy to the police, of which the applicant was found guilty by domestic force.

<<2920.86;2931.6;en>>
These facts are important as they have effects on the application of those parts of the domestic law that pertain to the legal basis of applicant's apprehension.

<<2931.6;2959.9;en>>
The applicant was apprehended on the basis of chapter 1, section 2 of the Coercive Measures Act, which holds in its relevant parts, and I quote, should the precredits for arrest exist and should the carrying out of the arrest otherwise be endangered, a policeman may apprehend a person suspected of an offense even without a warrant for his arrest.

<<2959.9;2965.82;en>>
The policeman shall notify an official with the powers of arrest the apprehension without delay.

<<2968.74;2978.56;en>>
Said officer shall decide within 24 hours of the apprehension whether the apprehended person is to be released or arrested.

<<2978.56;2980.86;en>>
End quote.

<<2980.86;2988.78;en>>
The prerequisites for arrest in turn are listed in chapter 1, section 3 of the Coercive Measures Act.

<<2988.78;2996.46;en>>
In this regard, the government notes that the applicant in his written submissions has cited outdated provisions of this act.

<<2996.46;3026.9;en>>
This is because the act has been amended in 2003 in relation to subsection 2 to read in relevant parts, and I quote, a person suspected with probable cause of offense may be arrested, number 2, if the offense is subjected to punishment of less than two years of imprisonment, but the most severe punishment stipulated for the offense is at the minimum one year of imprisonment.

<<3026.9;3051.94;en>>
And on the basis of the circumstances of the suspect or on the basis of other facts, it is probable that B, he will make it more difficult to clarify the case by destroying, defacing, altering, or concealing evidence or by influencing a witness, an insured person, an expert, or an accomplice, or he will continue his criminal activity.

<<3051.94;3054.06;en>>
End quote.

<<3054.06;3076.46;en>>
Further, the applicant has also provided the court with incomplete information in the citation of the Coercive Measures Act by omitting the second paragraph of section 3, which holds, and I quote, where there is a cause to suspect a person of an offense, he may be arrested even though there is no probable cause for the suspicion.

<<3076.46;3089.46;en>>
But the other prerequisites for arrest stipulated in paragraph 1 exist, and the taking of the suspect into custody is very important because of the expected further clarification.

<<3089.46;3094.98;en>>
The most severe punishment stipulated for rioting is one year of imprisonment.

<<3094.98;3105.66;en>>
Rather, further, the police has had reason to suspect that the person suspected of rioting would have continued their criminal activity.

<<3105.66;3117.14;en>>
Moreover, it was necessary to continue the apprehension of persons suspected of rioting into the morning and following day in order to investigate the suspected offenses.

<<3117.14;3125.26;en>>
As such, the prerequisites for arrest stipulated in the above-mentioned sections of the coercive measures existed.

<<3125.26;3143.44;en>>
Therefore, on the basis of both chapter 1, section 2 of the Coercive Measures Act, and section 21, subsection 2 of the Pretrial Investigation Act, the applicant could be held for a maximum of 24 hours.

<<3143.44;3154.34;en>>
Finally, section 21, subsection 1 of the Pretrial Investigation stipulates, and I quote, no one may be held in criminal investigation for longer than necessary.

<<3154.34;3173.74;en>>
In this regard, and specifically in relation to the applicant, once the detective chief inspector in charge of the detained persons learned of the applicant's profession, the applicant was then interviewed and released amongst the first apprehended persons.

<<3173.74;3183.86;en>>
The applicant notes that there were minors who were released before him, erroneously implying that he should have been released among them.

<<3183.86;3205.34;en>>
In any case, the government reiterates the general rule according to section 24 of the pretrial investigation, that no interrogations are to take place between 10 PM and 7 AM, as the above clarifications of the legal basis of the applicant apprehension and detention show.

<<3208.02;3213.54;en>>
There were no reasons relating to the investigation for his detention.

<<3213.54;3224.26;en>>
And it is also obvious that no exceptional circumstances of the kind stipulated under section 24 of the pretrial investigation existed in the present case.

<<3224.26;3233.54;en>>
The government submits that the only conclusion available here is that the alleged interference was at all times prescribed by law.

<<3233.54;3253.18;en>>
The government notes that despite the applicant's vacillating approach to his submissions before the grand chamber, he is nevertheless in agreement in government and chamber that those actions permissible by law undoubtedly constitute legitimate objectives.

<<3253.18;3272.1;en>>
While then, while on the face of it, the applicant dedicates tens of paragraphs to the assessment of the aspect necessary in democratic society constituted in Article 10, Paragraph 2.

<<3272.1;3293.88;en>>
The vast majority of his submissions are written from the point of view of seeking to assess the police actions on 10 September 2006 as a whole towards all of the members of the press who were present at the event.

<<3293.88;3309.3;en>>
Given that this is certainly not what the case is about, the government will directly focus its presentation on assessment of whether the alleged interference in the applicant's right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society.

<<3313.7;3327.14;en>>
The first disagreement between the parties concerns the assessment by the district court of the police's actions towards the applicant and whether he had conducted an assessment of the necessity.

<<3327.14;3333.02;en>>
They had conducted an assessment of necessity in the democratic society of that conduct.

<<3333.02;3344.5;en>>
The government points out that in this detailed assessment of the action of the police by the district court is to be found in its consideration of the evidence in question.

<<3344.5;3350.7;en>>
Indeed, in this light, the judgments need to be read as a whole.

<<3350.7;3363.38;en>>
The district court further noted that the organizer of the demonstration was unwilling to positively respond to the police's efforts to discuss the orderly progress and safety measures of the event on March.

<<3363.38;3383.3;en>>
Moreover, since the crowd at large failed to comply with repeated commands to disperse in order to cease the harm being suffered by members of the public and the police, the police was entitled to carry out apprehensions and arrests in their efforts to ensure public safety and restore order.

<<3383.3;3397.98;en>>
The district court equally notes that when the demonstration became violent, families and children and media representatives were allowed to pass through the police cordon, as much as confirmed by the chamber in paragraph 10 of judgment two.

<<3397.98;3412.5;en>>
Furthermore, members of the media, including the applicant, were able to report from the very midst of the event and photograph really right up until the very end of the situation, even at extremely close range to the police cordon.

<<3412.5;3431.66;en>>
Further, it is clear and uncontested on the basis of the applicant's own published account of the events at hand in Suomen Kuvalehti, he had personally with his own ears heard the police's orders to disperse already at 9.30 PM,

<<3431.66;3437.3;en>>
and he had also noticed that several people were heading towards the exit routes.

<<3437.3;3444.94;en>>
Yet he had chosen not to leave as the exit routes had seemed to him to be too burdensome.

<<3444.94;3447.48;en>>
The government observes that after 9.00 PM,

<<3447.48;3458.22;en>>
the police gave final orders to the remaining crowd at the event site to leave with the express notification that anybody failing to do so would be apprehended.

<<3458.22;3466.62;en>>
According to the documents, there were, in addition to the applicant, two other photographers, all of whom continued with their documentation of the event.

<<3466.62;3471.18;en>>
The other photographers left the scene around 9.15 PM,

<<3471.18;3472.98;en>>
as appears from the district court judgment.

<<3472.98;3476.46;en>>
No measures were imposed on them at any stage.

<<3476.46;3482.94;en>>
However, the police ordered the applicant to leave the event site at 9.15 PM

<<3482.94;3487.38;en>>
as the final apprehensions related to the remaining crowd were being made.

<<3487.38;3489.42;en>>
He refused to do so.

<<3489.42;3507.14;en>>
The applicant held to this defiant point of view, despite the fact that, as documents show, at the very time, the other non-company, at the same time, the other non-compliant members of the crowd were apprehended, and the event had come to an end.

<<3507.14;3516.62;en>>
Consequently, some minutes later, the police apprehended the applicant, as was clear that he continued not to comply with the orders of the police.

<<3516.62;3531.74;en>>
Moreover, the fact that the applicant consulted with his superior via telephone, asking for advice on whether to stay or leave, clearly indicates that the applicant understood that the order of the police to leave concerned him as well.

<<3531.74;3541.46;en>>
The district court, too, found it established that the police command could not be construed otherwise, and it clearly concerned everybody present.

<<3541.46;3559.86;en>>
As to the second point of contention under the necessity requirement, the government submits that the case law of the court cannot be understood in such a manner that as to confer onto journalists a privileged status in relation to the right to freedom of expression.

<<3559.86;3577.7;en>>
Rather, your court has at time and time observed that it must be borne in mind that the representatives of the media, and I quote, cannot be released from their duty to obey ordinarily criminal law on the basis of that article then of a stem protection.

<<3577.7;3583.66;en>>
Finally, the government reiterates that the applicant's coverage of the event was not hampered with.

<<3583.66;3585.14;en>>
He was allowed to phone.

<<3585.14;3593.58;en>>
His photographs were protected as journalistic sources, and no restrictions on their use were imposed.

<<3593.58;3597.54;en>>
He was released amongst the first persons on the following day.

<<3597.54;3602.46;en>>
No penalty was imposed upon his conviction for contumacy.

<<3602.46;3605.7;en>>
Nothing was recorded on his criminal record.

<<3605.7;3610.1;en>>
He was not even made to bear his costs.

<<3610.1;3625.38;en>>
Therefore, the government submits that Alex's interference with the applicant's right to freedom of expression was proportionate to the legitimate aim and pursuit, and moreover, necessary in democratic society.

<<3625.38;3649.22;en>>
And finally, the government submits that on the analysis of the case, the actions of the police cannot be considered to create a ceiling effect on the right to freedom of expression, contrary to the opinions of Judge Nicolau or Judge De Gaetano expressed in their joint separate dissenting opinion, and now followed by the applicant before the grand chamber.

<<3649.22;3678.86;en>>
The central claim by the applicant in relation to his ceiling effect argument rests on the validity of his claim that, and I quote, the state convicted a journalist for carrying out his work, even though he had already suffered the consequences of the police's concrete actions, which follows from the first three requirements set out in your court's consistent case law on the creation of ceiling effect.

<<3678.86;3693.14;en>>
That being, that in order for a ceiling effect to be established and applied to Alex's interference must be related to the actual reporting on the event in question.

<<3693.14;3708.82;en>>
In this respect, the government reiterates its submission that the applicant's apprehension, detention, and sentencing did not relate to his activities as a journalist but were due to him systematically not complying with clear police orders.

<<3708.82;3716.1;en>>
Indeed, no other conclusion could be made as contrary to the applicant's extensive assertions.

<<3716.1;3722.54;en>>
As the chamber noted, the applicant failed to make clear efforts to identify himself as a journalist.

<<3722.54;3737.08;en>>
And secondly, your court has considered that the sanctions imposed by governments must be found to be disproportionate for the reasons for infringing on the right of freedom of expression to find a ceiling effect.

<<3737.08;3746.1;en>>
Here, the government observes that the sanctions imposed on the applicant amounted to an offense deemed executable under domestic law.

<<3746.1;3752.3;en>>
As such, moreover, the applicant was not ordered to pay any costs.

<<3752.3;3768.98;en>>
And finally, and especially in relation to applying criminal law in cases of alleged infringement of Article 10, your court has stated that the use of criminal sanctions can be understood to be proportionate only in grave circumstances.

<<3768.98;3778.74;en>>
This phrase, in turn, has been interpreted as inter alia relating to the existence of threat or of violence against the public.

<<3778.74;3784.86;en>>
In the present case, this requirement is fulfilled as discussed above vis-a-vis the riot.

<<3784.86;3790.46;en>>
And as such, the use of criminal law sanctions must be understood to be proportionate.

<<3790.46;3801.36;en>>
As such, the government finds that the argument concerning the potential ceiling effect of disjudgment on the exercise of the journalist profession is completely unfounded.

<<3801.36;3809.18;en>>
Based on the above considerations, the government invites the court to conclude that there has been no violation of Article 10 of the convention.

<<3809.18;3810.26;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<3810.3;3815.26;en>>
Thank you Mr. Kosonen and I now turn to the judges to ask if there are questions.

<<3815.26;3816.26;en>>
Judge Hirabella.

<<3816.26;3816.26;en>>
I have a question for Judge Hirvelä.

[[Judge;Päivi Hirvelä]]

<<3818.75;3820.23;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<3820.23;3823.87;en>>
And I have two questions to both parties.

<<3823.87;3825.71;en>>
And first to the government.

<<3825.71;3841.81;en>>
The government, in the observations and also today, refers to the separate area reserved by the police for the media, which was on the square opposite to Kiasma Museum on the other side of the street.

<<3841.81;3857.75;en>>
However, it can be seen from the photos and from the video film that when the situation turned violent, visibility from that area to the scene was blocked by the police cordon, police cabs, and buses.

<<3857.75;3869.67;en>>
And my question is, was this area really useful for the journalists to cover the event on the spot when it turned violent?

<<3869.67;3878.99;en>>
My second question to the government concerns the apprehension time of the applicant and the legal basis of that.

<<3878.99;3884.03;en>>
And the applicant was apprehended for 17.5 hours.

<<3884.03;3891.03;en>>
And my question concerns the justification for the last 5.5 hours.

<<3891.03;3910.79;en>>
Since according to the Police Act, a person could not be kept apprehended for more than 12 hours, and the longer apprehension time, up to 24 hours by the Criminal Investigation Act, would have been applicable only if arrest was available.

<<3910.79;3921.31;en>>
And the applicant was charged and convicted of disobeying police order, and the statutory sanction of that would not have allowed arrest.

<<3921.31;3939.83;en>>
Now, I understood from the submission of the government that the government's allegation is that the applicant was apprehended of rioting, and it was only later changed to disobeying police orders.

<<3939.83;3951.67;en>>
However, according to the Ombudsman, a bystander who did not take part in violent actions as the applicant could not be apprehended of rioting.

<<3951.67;3958.67;en>>
And therefore, the longer apprehension time, this 24 hours, seems to be excluded.

<<3958.67;3972.23;en>>
And my question now is, since the legal basis for the apprehension for 12 hours, it's clear, but the question concerns the legal basis for the rest 5.5 hours.

<<3972.23;3976.51;en>>
And then I have two questions to the applicant.

<<3976.51;3987.69;en>>
And the applicant stated in his observation, and also today, that the police at the scene tried to hamper his journalistic work.

<<3987.69;4003.43;en>>
However, in the video films, and in photos, and in witness hearings before the National Court, there did not appear any indication of hindering by the police carrying out his work as a photographer.

<<4003.43;4015.29;en>>
And further, the applicant did not raise these allegations before the National Court or before the chamber.

<<4015.29;4025.03;en>>
And now, after eight years behind the incidents, after the incidents, he raises new facts.

<<4025.03;4044.75;en>>
And I only would like to mention the fact he raised today, here before the grand chamber, for the very first time, the allegation that he wished to give the memory card to the other journalist, which was not permitted by the police.

<<4044.75;4057.53;en>>
So my question is, why the applicant did not raise these facts and these allegations before the National Court or before the chamber?

<<4057.53;4065.39;en>>
Why the grand chamber is the first stage when these facts come out?

<<4065.39;4071.79;en>>
My other question concerns the press card, the badge.

<<4071.79;4078.99;en>>
And here, I again refer to the video film and the photo submitted by the applicant.

<<4078.99;4087.87;en>>
And in any shots, in any photos taken of the applicant at the scene, the press card cannot be seen.

<<4087.87;4092.59;en>>
And my question is, did he have the press card suspending around his neck?

<<4092.59;4100.95;en>>
And was it visible when he was working on the spot when the order to disperse was given?

<<4100.95;4100.95;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4103.03;4104.93;en>>
Thank you judge Hirvelä, judge Potocki.

[[Judge;André Potocki]]

<<4107.2;4108.2;fr>>
Merci, M. le Président.

<<4109.2;4109.96;fr>>
J'ai deux questions.

<<4110.12;4112.24;fr>>
La première s'adresse au gouvernement.

<<4113.88;4135.52;fr>>
Si un journaliste avait la crainte que le groupe des derniers manifestants qui refusait d'obéir à la police risquait de subir des mesures brutales, la décision de ce journaliste de rester sur place était-elle liée ou non à son travail d'information?

<<4138.44;4141.28;fr>>
Ma seconde question s'adresse au requérant.

<<4142.8;4161.0;fr>>
Dans ce que vous avez appelé des situations extrêmes, c'est-à-dire, à mes yeux, des manifestations, des catastrophes, des prises d'otages, est-ce qu'il suffit au journaliste d'invoquer sa mission d'information pour refuser d'obéir à la police?

<<4163.64;4176.4;fr>>
Si la réponse, selon vous, dépend des circonstances, quels sont alors, à votre avis, les critères qui doivent guider le comportement des journalistes face à des instructions ou des ordres de la police?

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4179.41;4183.49;fr>>
Merci beaucoup, juge Silvis.

[[Judge;Johannes Silvis]]

<<4186.03;4188.51;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4188.51;4213.63;en>>
The essence of the case, as characterized by the applicant, and my first question concerns the applicant, the essence of the case, as characterized by the applicant in the reasons for referring the case to the ground chamber, is the right of the state to restrict the impartation of real-time communications.

<<4213.63;4229.15;en>>
Now, today, the applicant raised the argument that he was refused to hand over the memory card, as already stated in the question of Judge Hirvelä.

<<4229.15;4235.07;en>>
My question is, was this raised before, either before the domestic authorities?

<<4235.07;4238.35;en>>
I haven't seen it in the file.

<<4238.35;4250.19;en>>
And second, has the newspaper tried, during the period of custody, to get hold of this material?

<<4250.19;4257.07;en>>
My second question is for the government and is related to the same matter.

<<4257.07;4267.99;en>>
The government observes that the purpose of arresting the applicant was not to hinder his freedom of expression, but to investigate the offense that he was suspected to have committed.

<<4267.99;4277.51;en>>
And in this connection, the government recalls that the applicant was able to use all of his photographs he may have had from the event.

<<4277.51;4290.59;en>>
Now, my question is, the government acknowledges that at a certain moment in time, the authorities realized that the person apprehended was a journalist.

<<4290.59;4299.51;en>>
This was at 9.30 p.m. or somewhat later the day.

<<4299.51;4309.51;en>>
Have the government considered the possible interest of immediate use of the photographs taken by the person apprehended?

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4314.37;4319.21;en>>
Merci, thank you Judge Silvis. Judge Motoc.

[[Judge;Iulia Antoanella Motoc]]

<<4321.88;4324.0;fr>>
Merci beaucoup, M. le Président.

<<4324.2;4327.36;fr>>
Ma 1re question s'adresse au gouvernement.

<<4327.56;4346.44;fr>>
Et vous avez dit qu'il y avait des informations concernant lesquelles cette manifestation pouvait tourner dans une manifestation très violente et que c'était l'Agence de sécurité finlandaise qui avait donné cette information.

<<4346.64;4364.32;fr>>
Dans la mesure où il est possible, je voulais savoir dans quelle mesure les informations qui étaient données par cette agence ont été prises en considération par le déploiement de la police et par la suite, par la manifestation elle-même.

<<4364.52;4376.16;fr>>
Si vraiment l'information qui a été donnée a été correspondue à l'ampleur de la manifestation et aux actions violentes qui étaient sur place.

<<4377.84;4384.56;fr>>
La 2e question que je voulais poser s'adresse au récurrent cette fois-ci.

<<4384.84;4389.04;fr>>
Et je voulais savoir si vraiment...

<<4389.28;4405.6;fr>>
Comment est-ce que vous percevez dans la jurisprudence de la Cour l'effet dissuasif que nos collègues qui font l'opinion séparée, et vous-même maintenant devant la Grande Chambre, ont fait, ont exposé dans leur opinion séparée?

<<4405.6;4423.36;fr>>
Est-ce que, comme vous le savez, cet effet dissuasif part de jugements de la Grande Chambre, comprenant Mazaré, et continue avec des autres jugements de la Cour, mais ces jugements-là vont toujours envers la condamnation pénale?

<<4423.56;4452.12;fr>>
Et une 3e question que je vais mettre en deux parties, si, à part les investigations qui étaient faites par l'Ombudsman, il y avait d'autres investigations qui étaient faites par rapport au comportement de la police, et si vraiment on a trouvé qu'il y avait des plaintes contre le comportement de la police par des manifestants, et si vraiment, si ces plaintes avaient eu lieu, comment est-ce que la fin de cette plainte s'est passée?

<<4452.12;4452.12;fr>>
Merci beaucoup, M. le Président.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4454.26;4457.42;fr>>
Merci beaucoup, Madame Motoc.

<<4457.42;4459.42;fr>>
Le juge Alexandre Sicilianos.

[[Judge;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<4464.41;4465.41;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4465.41;4469.29;en>>
I have two questions that are somehow peripheral.

<<4469.29;4472.65;en>>
They both concern the exact scope of the case.

<<4472.65;4476.85;en>>
I think that it is important to know exactly what we are speaking about.

<<4476.85;4480.61;en>>
My first question goes to the applicant.

<<4480.61;4485.45;en>>
In your application, you are invoking only Article 10 of the convention.

<<4485.45;4489.65;en>>
You do not invoke Article 11 on the freedom of assembly.

<<4489.65;4502.13;en>>
However, in contesting that the impugned interference was prescribed by law, your observations to the Grand Chamber mentioned the following, and a small quotation from paragraph 86 of your observations.

<<4502.13;4512.49;en>>
You say, the police's decision to treat the demonstration as a riot following its order for the public to disperse was questionable.

<<4512.49;4516.97;en>>
And then the extent of aggressive behavior was relatively small, and so on.

<<4516.97;4524.41;en>>
So apparently, you contest the legal basis of the police decision to disperse the demonstration.

<<4524.41;4533.93;en>>
So my question is whether you could clarify your position in respect of the scope of this case.

<<4533.93;4537.89;en>>
The second question goes to the government.

<<4537.89;4540.53;en>>
The agent, Mr. Kosonen, and you have repeatedly mentioned the

<<4540.53;4542.17;en>>
term of rioting.

<<4542.17;4547.09;en>>
Could you please clarify the meaning and scope of this term under national law and practice?

<<4547.09;4547.09;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4547.75;4550.91;en>>
Thank you very much, Dutch Spano.

[[Judge;Robert Spano]]

<<4550.94;4554.14;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4554.14;4569.1;en>>
A quick question to the government for clarification of factual assertions made by the government here today as regards the real-time assessment of the need for apprehension.

<<4569.1;4583.94;en>>
The applicant mentions at paragraph 133 of their observations the testimony given by the apprehending police officer, Mr. Tero Kivikangas, where he says, Mr. Pentikäinen

<<4583.94;4593.42;en>>
asked why he was being arrested, to which I replied that this was not an arrest but an apprehension.

<<4593.42;4621.76;en>>
So my question is, is the government contention or submitting now that when the police apprehended the applicant, which I assume was based on the measure according to the Police Act, the police was not reacting to the disobedience of an order, but the police was apprehending the applicant to remove a disturbance according to the Police Act.

<<4621.76;4636.84;en>>
So the fact that the assessment of the necessity of the interference being a disobedience of an order, that is not made by the police but by prosecutorial discretion or authorities at a later stage.

<<4636.84;4643.42;en>>
Could I get a clarification on that issue as in my view it can have a bearing on proportionality?

<<4643.42;4643.42;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4645.34;4647.46;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge Spano.

<<4652.73;4653.49;en>>
Thank you.

<<4653.49;4657.65;en>>
I have one question to the applicant, a factual question.

<<4657.85;4668.65;en>>
You mentioned, the lawyers mentioned, and it's in the file, that there was a call from the applicant to his employer or the editor of the magazine.

<<4668.95;4679.69;en>>
Could you please retell in as great detail as possible if you wish, the contents of that conversation?

<<4680.23;4681.81;en>>
Who asked what?

<<4681.81;4683.77;en>>
Who said what?

<<4683.77;4685.35;en>>
And whose was the final word?

<<4685.35;4685.35;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4686.38;4688.66;en>>
Thank you Judge Kūris, Judge Dedov.

[[Judge;Dmitry Dedov]]

<<4690.9;4693.02;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4693.02;4697.38;en>>
I have a question to first to the applicant.

<<4697.38;4707.02;en>>
You said about social issues, freedom of expression, ideas of political importance, and the right to impart and receive information.

<<4707.02;4725.94;en>>
Could you please specify what kind of social issues you try to impart and then to information on some social issues important to the public during this demonstration?

<<4725.94;4739.22;en>>
And the question to the government, were there any position on such public issues of public debate was manifested by the demonstration?

<<4739.22;4745.5;en>>
So in fact, what it was, a demonstration or a crowd?

<<4745.5;4745.5;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4747.71;4748.83;en>>
Thank you.

<<4748.83;4758.83;en>>
So we will have a break now and the hearing will resume at 10 to 11.

<<4824.25;4824.85;fr>>
La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4864.76;4867.24;en>>
Please sit down, the hearing is resumed.

<<4871.24;4872.24;en>>
So...

<<4872.24;4877.04;en>>
I call Mr. Salokangas.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<4879.49;4882.41;en>>
Mr. President and the members of the court,

<<4882.41;4894.3;en>>
as Judge Hirvela asked, whether the police hampered on journalistic work and was these allocations brought before the chamber?

<<4894.3;4903.26;en>>
These allocations are based on the hearing of a witness, Helminen, who witnessed four pentagon in the District Court of Helsinki.

<<4903.26;4923.34;en>>
He had said in the witness statement that the police actively hampered their work with shields and they tried to block photographers from photographing the event with feet and setting shields in front of a photographer.

<<4923.34;4941.14;en>>
And I endorse that the constable, Kivi Kangas, was aware that the applicant was a journalist on that time when he apprehended the applicant.

<<4941.14;4958.81;en>>
As to the question brought by the Silvis, the chief of editor, the judge Silvis, the chief of editor tried constantly calling to the police stations to find out where they hold the applicant.

<<4958.81;4976.14;en>>
However, the police stations answered that they were giving only details about the detention to their family members and he would not have a right to get information about where he was at the time of detention.

<<4976.14;4988.18;en>>
So therefore, he had told the applicant to go to the scene to photograph and he had interest in getting those photos back.

<<4988.18;5003.02;en>>
But I have to tell that the applicant has not before told that the claim that he had to give the memory cards to a colleague, this has not been brought before the district court of Helsinki or from the chamber.

<<5003.02;5008.85;en>>
But he has written about this on his article.

<<5008.85;5015.94;en>>
As to the question asked by Judge Motok, the chilling effect comes in question.

<<5015.94;5020.26;en>>
The applicant had to pay all the legal costs and not everyone can afford them.

<<5020.26;5025.41;en>>
The journalists in Finland are obeying the orders of the police strictly.

<<5025.41;5042.1;en>>
So this could mean that in the future, when the police doesn't want that the incident would come into the public, they could give disproportionate disperse order and the media could not work as a watchdog of the government.

<<5042.1;5060.53;en>>
And to the question asked by Judge Dedov, the social issues which were brought to the light were those that the demonstrators opposite the head of the states and the Asia-Europe Intergovernmental Summit.

<<5060.53;5073.3;en>>
The most relevant social issue was that there were a lot of bystanders on the event, not so many demonstrators, and the police used excessive force to detain them.

<<5073.3;5082.38;en>>
And this was very interesting for the media and I think this is the information which the public has also the right to receive.

<<5082.38;5084.61;en>>
And under the complaints, I would turn to my colleague, Mr Mattilainen.

[[Applicant;AP3]]

<<5094.23;5099.43;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<5099.43;5131.63;en>>
as for the Judge Podolsky's question on what kind of extreme situation or what are the criteria for the journalist to refuse to obey the orders of the police in extreme situation, I would like to endorse that, as we have mentioned in our written submissions, even journalists are equal before the law.

<<5131.63;5138.03;en>>
But here is the question, is another type of...

<<5138.03;5149.83;en>>
The question is, is police able to give, in such circumstances, orders that are not necessary?

<<5149.83;5164.47;en>>
As well, we have admitted that it might be challenging for the police to distinguish people in these kind of extreme situations, where the events transform rapidly.

<<5164.47;5176.99;en>>
But the applicant views that if the journalist is seemingly recognizable by a vest or a card, he or she should be leaving peace.

<<5176.99;5197.03;en>>
Or if the police him or herself has admitted factually that he or she has apprended a journalist, the journalist should be leaving peace, as was the case in the applicant's case.

<<5197.03;5226.43;en>>
Now, as for Judge Siciliano's question about the scope of this case, or the extent of the scope, we have actually not contested the police's right to give an order for the crowd to disperse or order the demonstration to be stopped.

<<5226.43;5251.03;en>>
We have mainly, and I want to emphasize mainly, contested the police's right to apprehend people for the sheer fact that they were part of the event that the police declared as a riot, without making any kind of distinction between potentially violent individuals or other demonstrators.

<<5251.03;5251.03;en>>
Thank you.

<<5262.27;5265.65;en>>
Dear Mr. President, members of the court,

<<5265.65;5279.03;en>>
regarding to Judge Kyrgyz's question about the phone calls made during the demonstration, I was almost nine years ago present at this demonstration.

<<5279.03;5296.59;en>>
And towards the end of the demonstration, I noticed more aggressive use of force by the police against the seemingly peaceful and so-called neutral demonstrators.

<<5296.59;5313.79;en>>
And after this situation, as I have told also in Helsinki District Court and first interrogations, there were efforts from police to hamper photographing those arrests where they were using excessive force.

<<5313.79;5324.07;en>>
And immediately after this happening, I made a phone call to my employer, and I said that the situation is turning strange.

<<5324.07;5328.31;en>>
The police is now attacking demonstrators.

<<5328.31;5345.07;en>>
And I asked what to do, and he said to me, try your best to do your work and document everything what happens.

<<5345.07;5350.07;en>>
And there was other phone call just right after I was apprehended.

<<5350.07;5355.59;en>>
And in this phone call, I only told that I have been now apprehended by police.

<<5355.59;5360.19;en>>
And my photographic gear is going to be confiscated.

<<5360.19;5368.11;en>>
And I asked for the possibility to give the memory cards, and that was not possible at that time.

<<5368.11;5368.11;en>>
Thank you.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<5371.06;5384.88;en>>
Still to the question, what Judge Motok asked, if there were any investigation of the police behavior, there were some complaints about the behavior of the police.

<<5384.88;5389.56;en>>
There was even a criminal prosecution pending.

<<5389.56;5402.82;en>>
But the prosecutor and the police could not identify which policemen had detained bystanders and which policemen had acted against the police act.

<<5402.82;5411.0;en>>
However, the charges were dropped because the identification of the policemen were not known.

<<5411.0;5416.44;en>>
Also, many journalists complained about the behavior of the police.

<<5416.44;5425.6;en>>
Actually, the Union of Journalists in Finland had a discussion with the Ministry of the Interior after the event where we discussed about the case.

<<5425.6;5432.56;en>>
And we tried to make principles so that this kind of case would not happen in the future.

<<5432.56;5432.56;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5440.79;5442.19;en>>
Have you finished your submission?

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<5442.19;5443.59;en>>
Yes, thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5443.59;5445.59;en>>
So then I give the floor to Mr. Kosonen.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<5456.19;5458.59;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<5458.59;5461.15;en>>
Various questions to the government also.

<<5461.15;5477.73;en>>
Firstly, concerning the separate area which was there, which is now, I think, a fact which we can say that both parties are of that opinion after what we have said and what we have said in our address too.

<<5477.73;5490.91;en>>
There was a separate area, and the visibility from that area, which is just behind the other part of the Mannerheim, to this place where demonstration took place.

<<5490.91;5505.65;en>>
Very, very nice view from there, and as you can see, you have certainly looked at the video, and there you can see it, just on the other side of the street, and there was also a television crew just filming there.

<<5505.65;5530.07;en>>
Of course, when the riot or demonstration became violent, the police has to act in a certain way, and then there were buses, which of course restricted the visibility from that separate area to the place where the demonstrators were, and the demonstration event took place.

<<5530.07;5538.07;en>>
But as I said in my address, this was not planned to do so, to be so. The idea was that from that area,

<<5538.07;5551.31;en>>
the public, the media has a good place to cover everything, and unfortunately, it became violent, and the reason for that was that no march could be taken and so forth.

<<5551.31;5579.03;en>>
But anyway, it's true, it certainly was a good idea to have a demonstration, and I think that the applicant had the choice to be somewhere else, all the journalists could be somewhere else, and the applicant was very near to the demonstrators, and now his visibility was not hindered in any way.

<<5581.83;5613.15;en>>
As regards the question of whether there was a demonstration or demonstrators, or whether it was a crowd, first there was a demonstration, but quite soon, police ordered it to be ended, and that was not peaceful anymore, there was no demonstration anymore, and then of course you can just see that there was a crowd.

<<5613.15;5619.65;en>>
And our legislation refers to a crowd which the police can order to disperse.

<<5623.55;5628.05;en>>
And the applicant was part of that crowd, certainly.

<<5628.05;5648.23;en>>
As regards the Finnish Secret Service and its examinations and its statements and documents, they were useful, and that also related to earlier demonstrations which had taken place one or a couple of years earlier, and that's evident also from the facts of the case.

<<5648.23;5656.15;en>>
And the police used that, and regretfully it found to be like the Secret Service was estimated.

<<5661.47;5684.21;en>>
Then, the Finnish Secret Service, and then concerning, well I have one point here, and then concerning, well I have one point here, and then concerning, well I have one point here, which relates to the reasoning of the district court, or the reasoning of the issue, and the applicant had said here that there was no reasoning at all.

<<5684.21;5691.53;en>>
And I already explained in my address how the district court's judgment must be analyzed.

<<5691.53;5704.61;en>>
As regards the Supreme Court, there was a leave to appeal proceed, so it's of course, it's such that there's, it's not required that there should be reasonings.

<<5705.97;5709.62;en>>
It's under your court's case law, too.

<<5709.62;5723.85;en>>
And, well I can perhaps continue after Madam Mayuri has explained the legislation and how it affects apprehension and detention and so forth.

<<5723.85;5726.01;en>>
Madam Mayor, would you, with your indulgence, of course.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<5739.36;5745.04;en>>
Mr. President, there was a question about the length of the apprehension,

<<5745.04;5751.34;en>>
and I will now explain a little bit of the legal background of that.

<<5751.34;5755.64;en>>
Actually, I refer to the government's address earlier today.

<<5755.64;5774.64;en>>
Government tried to give clarification of the relevant legislation at that time, and the relevant act is the Coercive Measures Act, and particularly sections two and three from the chapter one.

<<5774.64;5791.84;en>>
The Coercive Measures Act requires that in order to have the possibility to apprehend for maximum 24 hours, there has to be prerequisites for arrest at present.

<<5791.84;5799.34;en>>
And in government's view, there were prerequisites of arrest at present.

<<5799.34;5812.34;en>>
Firstly, the applicant was apprehended on the basis of rioting, and the maximum punishment is one year imprisonment for rioting.

<<5812.34;5819.54;en>>
And I refer to the subsection two of the Coercive Measures Act.

<<5819.54;5825.24;en>>
So this fulfills the requirements of the act in this respect.

<<5825.24;5846.94;en>>
And secondly, persons who were suspected of rioting would have probably continued with the criminal activity rioting later on, and this fulfills subsection c requirement.

<<5846.94;5861.64;en>>
I mean in the Coercive Measures Act, the requirement of the intention of continuing criminal activity.

<<5861.64;5874.14;en>>
But I also like to emphasize the importance of second paragraph of section three, which came up in government's address today.

<<5874.14;5885.34;en>>
And probably it's good for understanding if I read, if I quote the subjects, because it goes like this.

<<5885.34;5893.54;en>>
When there is a cause to suspect a person of an offense, he may be arrested even though there is not probable cause.

<<5893.54;5902.14;en>>
Not probable cause for the suspicion, but the other prerequisites for arrest stipulated in paragraph one exist.

<<5902.14;5910.54;en>>
And the taking of the suspect into custody is very important because of expected further clarification.

<<5910.54;5917.54;en>>
So in this particular case, it was important to have further clarification on the matter.

<<5917.54;5937.94;en>>
And as the subsection which I quoted says, it isn't obligatory to have a cause, probable cause to suspect, but cause to suspect is enough.

<<5937.94;5950.54;en>>
And I also like to emphasize that usually the prerequisites of arrest, they clarify later on when the investigation goes on.

<<5950.54;5954.94;en>>
So they are not at hand in the beginning.

<<5954.94;5965.54;en>>
And one also has to remember in this case that there was a considerable amount of persons being detained at that time.

<<5965.54;5973.74;en>>
The amount was 121 persons in detention.

<<5973.74;5982.54;en>>
So this also has to be taken into account when considering the length of detention.

<<5982.54;6001.94;en>>
But the government's view is that the prerequisites of arrest are fulfilled and also all the elements of Coercive Measures Act, the provisions are fulfilled in this case.

<<6001.94;6001.94;en>>
Thank you.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<6005.79;6010.71;en>>
Mr. President, may I still have a few words

<<6010.71;6024.55;en>>
concerning firstly what the applicant and his representatives said about the filming or that the police hindered them, the applicant, to make photos or others.

<<6024.55;6028.99;en>>
What Mr. Helminen said in the district court,

<<6028.99;6033.87;en>>
he was invited by the applicant to be there.

<<6033.87;6045.27;en>>
He said, he indeed said that, argued that the police hindered photographing with their shields and legs.

<<6048.23;6078.91;en>>
And you can see in those videos just the situation very well, which I also expressed in my, indicated or explained in my address that it was rather, it was a normal, let's say normal painting situation where a certain person had been marked and then the police came and took him away behind the cordon.

<<6078.91;6093.15;en>>
And during that time, there was a rush of photographers to the place and they were very near to the police faces and the police naturally could take place.

<<6093.15;6097.07;en>>
They raised their shields, but these shields are transparent.

<<6097.07;6098.55;en>>
That's one issue.

<<6098.55;6120.79;en>>
Another question, one question related to the fact whether what the government likes in general terms of demonstrations and I think demonstrations, they are allowed by the convention and constitution and they are, of course, there must be demonstration if need be and if people think so.

<<6120.79;6131.67;en>>
I don't have any idea about those, but this came while and therefore it had to be stopped and to protect the safety.

<<6131.67;6146.31;en>>
And finally, concerning, concerning, concerning, concerning, just a minute.

<<6160.31;6163.95;en>>
All right, I think that's it anyway, yes.

<<6163.95;6163.95;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<6174.01;6176.01;en>>
So, thank you very much.

<<6176.01;6180.01;en>>
We have now come to the end of the hearing.

<<6180.01;6188.37;en>>
I thank the parties for their interventions and answers to the court's questions.

<<6188.37;6192.57;en>>
The courts will now deliberate on the merits.

<<6192.57;6198.53;en>>
The judgment will be delivered later, and the parties will be informed of the date of delivery.

<<6198.53;6198.53;en>>
I declare the hearing closed.

La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<55.93;56.93;en>>
Please be seated.

<<68.97;76.05;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of ND and NT versus Spain.

<<76.05;91.65;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on 12 February 2015 under Article 34 of the Convention by a Malian National, Mr. ND, and the National of the Ivory Coast, Mr. NT.

<<91.65;100.77;en>>
The application was allocated to the third section of the court pursuant to Rule 52, Paragraph 1 of the Rules of the Court.

<<100.77;107.41;en>>
It was communicated to the government on 7 July 2015.

<<107.41;116.17;en>>
On 3 October 2017, a chamber of the third section delivered its judgment in the case.

<<116.17;128.73;en>>
It unanimously declared the application admissible and held that there had been a violation of Articles 4 or Protocol Number 4 and 13 of the Convention.

<<128.73;140.37;en>>
On 14 December 2017, the government requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention.

<<140.37;147.85;en>>
And the panel of the Grand Chamber accepted that request on 29 January 2018.

<<147.85;163.93;en>>
The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe has exercised a right under Article 36, Paragraph 3 of the Convention to intervene in the proceedings before the Grand Chamber and submitted written observations.

<<163.93;197.57;en>>
Leave to intervene was also granted under Article 36, Paragraph 2 of the Convention and Rule 44, Paragraph 3 of the Rules of Court to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Spanish Commission for Assistance to Refugees, and acting collectively, the AIR Centre, Amnesty International, the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, the International Commission of Jurists, and the Dutch Council for Refugees.

<<197.57;215.93;en>>
The governments of Belgium, France, and Italy also submitted observations as third parties before the Grand Chamber, having been granted leave to that effect pursuant to rule to Article 36, Paragraph 2 of the Convention.

<<215.93;238.05;en>>
At this hearing, the respondent government are represented by their agents, Mr. Rafael Andrés Leon Cavero, Mr. Francisco de Asís Sanz Gandasegui, and Mr. Alfonso Brezmes Martínez De Villarreal, and by Manuel Montobbio, permanent representative of Spain with the Council of Europe.

<<238.05;250.77;en>>
They are assisted by Mr. Francisco Coria  Rico, Mr. Jesús Rueda Jimenez, Mr. Juan  Valterra De Simón, and Mr. Luis Tarín Martín, advisors.

<<250.77;258.29;en>>
The applicants are represented by Mr.Carsten Gericke and Mr. Gonzalo Boye, counsel.

<<258.29;268.41;en>>
They are assisted by Mr. Wolfgang Kaleck, Mrs. Hanaa Hakiki, Mrs. Rocío Moreno, and Mrs. Isabel Elbal, advisors.

<<268.41;282.21;en>>
The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, Mrs. Dunja Mijatovic, will also participate in this hearing, pursuant to her right under Article 36, Paragraph 3 of the Convention.

<<282.21;288.77;en>>
She is assisted by Mrs. Francoise Kempf and Mrs. Anne Weber, advisors.

<<288.77;299.41;en>>
In addition, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was granted leave to participate in this hearing under Article 36, Paragraph 2 of the Convention.

<<299.41;312.85;en>>
She is represented by Mrs. Grainne O’hara, director of the Division of International Protection, assisted by Mrs. Marta García and Mr. Randhir Wanigasekara, advisors.

<<312.85;318.69;en>>
I welcome the representatives of the parties in the name of the court.

<<318.69;330.25;en>>
I also welcome a delegation of the European Judicial Training Network and a delegation of Latvian judges who are on a study visit to the court.

<<330.25;343.25;en>>
Having consulted the agents of the government, the representatives of the applicants, and the representatives of the third parties, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<343.25;355.01;en>>
Mr. Gericke and Mr. Boye for the applicants will speak first, and then Mr.  Leon Cavero for the government, and finally Mrs. Mijatović and Mrs. O’hara, third parties.

<<355.01;373.13;en>>
I would explain that in addition to interpreting in the two official languages of the court, English and French, interpreting into Montenegrin has been authorized for the benefit of a group of law students from Montenegro attending this hearing.

<<373.13;382.81;en>>
That interpreting is not arranged by the court, and no transcription of the oral translation will be included in the official record of the proceedings.

<<382.81;384.25;en>>
I call Mr. Gericke.

<<384.25;384.89;en>>
You have the floor, please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<390.32;393.92;en>>
Mr. President, Honorable Members of the Court,

<<393.92;398.42;en>>
let me take you back to the 13th of August, 2014.

<<398.42;401.12;en>>
It is very early in the morning and still dark.

<<401.12;406.2;en>>
A group of men climb over a border fence into the Melilla border structure.

<<406.2;412.44;en>>
Some of them reach the top of the last fence, the one facing inwards towards the city.

<<412.44;417.0;en>>
Amongst them are the two applicants, Mr. N.D. and Mr. N.T.

<<417.0;420.38;en>>
At their feet, they see a Spanish road on the one side.

<<420.38;427.32;en>>
On the other side, they see their friends being beaten up by Moroccan officers despite their peacefulness.

<<427.32;431.62;en>>
N.D. spent nine months living in Morocco in fear of those blows,

<<431.62;434.92;en>>
N.T. even longer, over a year.

<<434.92;437.8;en>>
So they stay on the fence.

<<437.8;440.52;en>>
Later on that day, N.D. and N.T.

<<440.52;442.2;en>>
are still on the inward fence.

<<442.2;445.04;en>>
The Guardia Civil are waiting for them.

<<445.04;449.8;en>>
On the other side of the fences, Moroccan officers are also waiting for them.

<<449.8;452.44;en>>
No one else is allowed near the scene.

<<452.44;456.92;en>>
There are no legal advisors or interpreters present.

<<456.92;460.12;en>>
N.D. and N.T. speak no Spanish and no English,

<<460.12;468.22;en>>
so no communication is possible with the Guardia Civil or other Spanish authorities.

<<468.22;471.76;en>>
At around 2 p.m., N.T. climbs down a ladder

<<471.76;474.88;en>>
and he sets foot onto the Spanish road.

<<474.88;478.84;en>>
He's immediately grabbed by Spanish officers and handcuffed.

<<478.84;484.84;en>>
He's walked through the border structure and handed over to Moroccan officers.

<<484.84;489.36;en>>
An hour later, the same happens to N.D.

<<489.36;515.08;en>>
Despite the authorities' efforts to stop journalists from documenting the event, by the afternoon, the newspaper El Diario reports that about 60 migrants have already been returned in a summary manner without complying with the Spanish law on foreigners, whilst 15 persons are still on the inward fence and four had been transferred to a hospital.

<<515.08;528.2;en>>
These summary expulsions or hot returns have been practiced by Spain for over a decade, with the authorities obstructing independent reporting on these operations.

<<528.2;532.1;en>>
Journalists are detected and chased away.

<<532.1;545.24;en>>
However, on the 13th of August, 2014, images were obtained, in particular of the summary expulsions executed in daylight, including that of N.T.

<<545.24;552.9;en>>
This rare footage was submitted as evidence when these two applications were filed.

<<552.9;559.6;en>>
Spain was left with no choice but to admit the summary group of expulsion of that day.

<<559.6;567.8;en>>
Spain also admits that this was done as a matter of policy under its operational border protocol.

<<567.8;571.72;en>>
This is why, factually, this case is rather simple.

<<571.72;584.44;en>>
Yet, in its exceedingly wrong written observations, Spain constantly attempts to blur the issues by making many false claims and by submitting misleading documents.

<<584.44;590.0;en>>
We will not be able to address all of these claims and documents today.

<<590.0;604.52;en>>
Therefore, we ask the court to assume that, unless expressly admitted by us, both the claims made by Spain and the evidence submitted are disputed by the applicants.

<<604.52;608.28;en>>
One of Spain's claims needs to be addressed straight away.

<<608.28;615.8;en>>
Throughout these proceedings, Spain constantly referred to violence and to a violent attack on the fence.

<<615.8;623.52;en>>
Yet, no direct allegation of violence was ever made against N.T. and D. or their companions.

<<623.52;628.62;en>>
And not a shred of evidence was presented on that point.

<<628.62;640.36;en>>
To the contrary, the evidence from both sides shows that, on that day, the fence climbers were not violent, but subjected to brutal anti-grading treatment.

<<640.36;648.64;en>>
Therefore, Spain's claim is nothing but a miserable attempt to taint the applicants' reputation.

<<648.64;652.08;en>>
Spain also tries to dilute the legal issues of this case.

<<652.08;655.88;en>>
This case is not about the applicants' asylum claims.

<<655.88;668.88;en>>
It is also not about assessing whether the expulsion procedure meets the individual examination standard of Article IV, Fourth Protocol, as this court did in Clarifia.

<<668.88;676.48;en>>
Indeed, in the present case, the applicants were not registered or identified before they were expelled.

<<676.48;678.24;en>>
They were not spoken to.

<<678.24;680.34;en>>
They were not even counted.

<<680.34;689.56;en>>
They were simply handcuffed and walked back to Morocco, as Spain admits, without any possible procedure or exception.

<<689.56;711.04;en>>
So the legal question in this case is only whether, under the Convention and its protocols, a state should be allowed to summarily expel individuals from its territory without giving them the slightest possibility to raise any arguments against their expulsion.

<<711.04;714.44;en>>
Spain claims that it should be allowed to do so.

<<714.44;726.04;en>>
It argues that the very concept of territorial jurisdiction, a concept key to the effective application of the Convention, should be put aside.

<<726.04;728.56;en>>
This will be my first point of address this morning.

<<728.56;733.64;en>>
I will then turn to the particular factual and legal issues of this case.

<<733.64;735.96;en>>
My colleague, Mr. Boyer, will then

<<735.96;745.72;en>>
answer the court's questions on the applicant's access to asylum at the Rabat Embassy, the Nardois Consulate, and the Beni Ensa border post at the material time.

<<750.56;755.24;en>>
As to jurisdiction, the first question that we need to ask is the following.

<<755.24;759.92;en>>
Is the Melilla border fence structure located on Spanish territory?

<<759.92;764.64;en>>
The answer is that paragraph 107 of Spain's observations.

<<764.64;774.8;en>>
And I quote, as contemplated in the Wadras Treaty, the fence had to be built within the Spanish-owned territory, end of quote.

<<774.8;778.88;en>>
So Spain admits that territorial jurisdiction could apply.

<<778.88;786.86;en>>
What it now argues is that it should not apply because, and again I quote, Spain has restricted its full jurisdiction.

<<786.86;790.8;en>>
This is paragraph 108.

<<790.8;798.4;en>>
As conformed in the court's case law, the convention applies to the whole of the contracting party's territory.

<<798.4;814.94;en>>
Limited exceptions exist, but these are strictly defined, namely when another actor has absolute and effective control of part of a territory and the state party tried but failed to ensure the application of the convention.

<<814.94;818.92;en>>
In other words, in situations of occupation.

<<818.92;830.16;en>>
Aside from that particular case, the case law precludes territorial exclusions, including by explicit reservation.

<<830.16;837.8;en>>
It simply does not allow for parts of the territory to be excluded from the scrutiny of the convention.

<<837.8;857.98;en>>
In the words of the grand chamber in Asanidze versus Georgia, any such exceptions to territorial jurisdiction would, quote, render the notion of effective human rights protection underpinning the entire convention meaningless, end of quote.

<<857.98;868.6;en>>
In light of this clear jurisprudence, Spain's claim that it has restricted its jurisdiction within the Melilla border fence structure does not stand.

<<868.6;888.12;en>>
In fact, even if one wanted to avoid territorial considerations, as the chamber did in its judgment, it is also clear that Spain had effective and absolute control of both the border fence structure and the applicants.

<<888.12;896.28;en>>
Indeed, Spain initiated, paid for, and carried out the construction of the structure in 2005.

<<896.28;904.72;en>>
Since then, it exclusively controls access to it and pays for its maintenance.

<<904.72;908.6;en>>
Only Spanish officers open and close the gates.

<<908.6;926.2;en>>
They decide who and when to expel, not for a reduced and short period of time, as the French government claimed in its intervention, but since the very construction of the structure in 2005 and up until now.

<<926.2;933.32;en>>
Therefore, we see absolutely no grounds on which an exception to jurisdiction could be made.

<<933.32;940.72;en>>
The border fence structure is and always has been on Spanish territory and under the exclusive and effective control of Spain.

<<945.26;956.36;en>>
Turning now to the facts of the case, Spain's main argument is that not enough evidence was submitted by the applicants of their expulsion on the 13th of August, 2014.

<<956.36;959.42;en>>
And I will now answer this claim.

<<959.42;970.48;en>>
To establish which facts the parties disagree on, we must first let the dust created by Spain settle.

<<970.48;983.44;en>>
In Spain's submissions, in particular paragraph 16 and 17, we see that Spain agrees that at least 70 individuals were at some point physically on Spanish soil.

<<983.44;995.04;en>>
Secondly, in these paragraphs, Spain further agrees that these individuals were returned to Morocco automatically with no procedure.

<<995.04;1013.42;en>>
Third, Spain admits in its so-called expert report that two days after the events, NT gave a video interview about this expulsion where he holds a picture of his particular expulsion in his hands.

<<1013.42;1018.92;en>>
These three crucial points all confirm the applicants' accounts.

<<1018.92;1024.18;en>>
However, Spain claims that more conclusive evidence should have been submitted.

<<1024.18;1033.4;en>>
And as the chamber pointed out, it would be grossly unfair for Spain to defend this case on that basis.

<<1033.4;1044.84;en>>
Indeed, the inexistence of records of the expulsions is the very subject of this case and part of Spain's failures under the convention.

<<1044.84;1055.18;en>>
Similarly, as we know, the inexistence of high-quality close-up pictures of the events is another consequence of Spain's conduct.

<<1055.18;1060.6;en>>
Spain cannot now use these arguments to escape this court's scrutiny.

<<1060.6;1072.12;en>>
As the chamber ruled, Spain is stopped from doing so, especially since the evidence in this case is not only sufficient.

<<1072.12;1082.48;en>>
It is exceptional and even includes video footage of the events on which the applicants identified themselves.

<<1082.48;1092.4;en>>
Now, Spain claims it is impossible to identify the applicants on that footage and submitted a so-called expert report on that point.

<<1092.4;1099.24;en>>
We note that this report was compiled by the Ministry of Interior in order to defend this case.

<<1099.24;1112.4;en>>
The officers writing the report compared identity photos of the applicants with snapshots of random individuals on the border fence, not close-ups of the applicants.

<<1112.4;1118.2;en>>
We raised this in front of the chamber, who gave no weight to this report.

<<1118.2;1127.62;en>>
To our surprise, Spain submitted this report again for this hearing without addressing any of these substantial mistakes.

<<1127.62;1131.0;en>>
Instead, Spain made yet more errors.

<<1131.0;1138.4;en>>
In its submissions, it again circled the wrong man for both N.D. and N.T.

<<1138.4;1143.92;en>>
Spain also claimed that on the picture of the border fence on which N.D. identified himself,

<<1143.92;1151.44;en>>
he and others merrily appear as, and I quote, tiny, indistinguishable blots.

<<1151.44;1156.28;en>>
This is simply untrue if one looks at the relevant snapshots of the video we submitted.

<<1156.28;1163.12;en>>
I refer you to the second picture in our additional annex 1 as submitted for this hearing.

<<1163.12;1172.36;en>>
This is only one example of the gross distortions used by Spain to insert doubt as to the truthfulness of the applicants' accounts.

<<1172.36;1177.0;en>>
But on a closer look, none of it stands.

<<1177.0;1186.28;en>>
This is why the chamber, in its judgment, did not merrily ignore Spain's arguments as to the applicants' credibility, as Spain claims.

<<1186.28;1189.78;en>>
It rejected these arguments as ill-founded.

<<1189.78;1202.58;en>>
And it rightly ruled that the applicants have offered reliable and conclusive evidence of being amongst the 70 individuals automatically returned from Spanish soil to Morocco on the 13th of August.

<<1206.98;1212.88;en>>
I will now turn to the legal arguments in the case, namely, Article 4, Fourth Protocol, and Article 13.

<<1215.46;1237.04;en>>
Though border protection falls within state sovereignty, this sovereignty is qualified, notably by absolute prohibitions under the convention, that under Article 3, and that under Article 4, Fourth Protocol, which, in the wording of the convention, allows for no justified or proportionate limitations.

<<1237.04;1248.64;en>>
Indeed, the prohibition of collective expulsion provides for an essential guarantee, that's to have access to some procedure before being expelled.

<<1248.64;1258.56;en>>
As the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stated in his intervention to the chamber, it is a fair trial and due process guarantee.

<<1258.56;1269.92;en>>
The UN Committee Against Torture goes further and identifies the prohibition as a precondition for the realization of non-refulmon.

<<1269.92;1274.84;en>>
But as the UN High Commissioner also highlights, these two principles are distinct.

<<1274.84;1293.88;en>>
As defined in CLAIFIA, the prohibition of collective expulsion provides for a genuine and effective possibility to raise arguments against an expulsion and to have those arguments examined in an appropriate manner by the authorities.

<<1293.88;1308.36;en>>
The first step of this test, the genuine and effective possibility to raise arguments against an expulsion, asks whether the authorities allowed for a claim to be expressed before they expel.

<<1308.36;1310.88;en>>
This question is purely procedural.

<<1310.88;1317.32;en>>
In the jurisprudence of the court, it requires at least identification.

<<1317.32;1332.52;en>>
As for the type of arguments which one could raise against an expulsion, the UN High Commissioner points out that these are not limited to asylum in relation to the country of origin, contrary what Spain suggests.

<<1332.52;1345.72;en>>
Other types of arguments exist, for example, for traffic victims, for unaccompanied minors, or for persons who fear ill treatment in the country of destination.

<<1345.72;1352.8;en>>
The procedural step is essential to establish the existence of a claim, any claim.

<<1352.8;1360.04;en>>
And only after this step is fulfilled can one distinguish between those who raise arguments and those who do not.

<<1360.04;1366.2;en>>
But first, the possibility to raise arguments must be given to all.

<<1366.2;1372.6;en>>
And for such a procedure to happen, all must be identified.

<<1372.6;1377.76;en>>
Only then can one distinguish between those who raise arguments and those who do not.

<<1377.76;1393.64;en>>
The distinction comes in the second part of the test, when the court assesses whether arguments were raised and were individually examined in a reasonable and objective manner before the expulsion.

<<1393.64;1395.68;en>>
What does this mean for the present case?

<<1395.68;1422.56;en>>
It means that before examining issues relating to asylum, the intention to claim asylum, the credibility of a claim, the situation in the country of origin or the existence of potential safe third countries, one has to ask the procedural question, did the applicants have an opportunity to raise arguments, any arguments against the expulsion, before they were sent back to Morocco?

<<1425.32;1431.0;en>>
On the 13th of August, nobody was provided with that opportunity.

<<1431.0;1434.08;en>>
The applicants were not even registered.

<<1434.08;1443.88;en>>
They were not given any opportunity to express their intention to claim asylum or their fears of ill treatment in Morocco.

<<1443.88;1460.52;en>>
And as a result, these arguments could not have been considered by Spain, let alone in an appropriate manner and in light of information available at the time as to the fate of sub-Saharan refugees and migrants in Morocco.

<<1460.52;1468.08;en>>
The applicants do not claim that, as Spain states, that there is an absolute right to lawful entry.

<<1468.08;1479.6;en>>
They claim that under Article 4, Fourth Protocol, they should have had an opportunity on the 13th of August, 2014, to challenge their expulsion back to Morocco.

<<1479.6;1484.88;en>>
In fact, the concept of a lawful entry is irrelevant under the article.

<<1484.88;1497.2;en>>
What matters is that the applicants were factually on Spanish soil under the effective control of Spanish officers and that they were factually driven away.

<<1497.2;1504.16;en>>
This is the definition of expulsion in both Hilsi and Ghaifria.

<<1504.16;1511.64;en>>
And unless an opportunity to raise arguments is provided, this expulsion is collective.

<<1511.64;1529.4;en>>
In the present case, this opportunity was explicitly excluded by Spain's operative border protocol for the applicants and for anyone, regardless of the type or the strength of any argument they may have had against their expulsion.

<<1533.6;1543.36;en>>
Spain attempts to defend this unlawful policy with migratory pressure, ignoring this court's clear jurisprudence on this point.

<<1543.36;1552.24;en>>
Migratory pressure cannot justify summary expulsions in violation of Article 4, Fourth Protocol.

<<1552.24;1566.56;en>>
In fact, it is precisely in situations of high arrival numbers of persons with protection needs that the safeguard of Article 4, Fourth Protocol finds its whole purpose.

<<1566.56;1571.36;en>>
And it is exactly then that these guarantees must be upheld.

<<1574.12;1596.2;en>>
Aside from this legal principle, factually, as also pointed out by the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights in front of the chamber, at the material time, asylum applications in Spain merrily represented 1% of those within the EU.

<<1596.2;1606.38;en>>
However, when facing migratory challenges, states can request and receive support from the European Union.

<<1606.38;1613.32;en>>
To this day, Spain has never made any such requests in relation to its African enclaves.

<<1613.32;1625.12;en>>
As a result, and unlike, for example, in Italy or Greece, the European Asylum Support Office, EASU, was never deployed in Ceuta or Melilla.

<<1625.12;1635.64;en>>
Instead, Spain's political choice is to ignore its legal obligations and simply enforce arbitrary and automatic expulsions.

<<1635.64;1649.02;en>>
This is how, like everyone else on the 13th of August, the applicants were automatically denied any access to any remedy against their expulsion.

<<1649.02;1659.92;en>>
There was no effective domestic remedy, neither practically nor theoretically, which they could have exhausted before coming to this court.

<<1659.92;1664.44;en>>
They seek a remedy here today.

<<1664.44;1666.8;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<1666.8;1673.84;en>>
in the course of my preparation of this hearing, Mr. Endi told me again what he had gone through

<<1673.84;1681.16;en>>
during his migratory path, including in Morocco, then asked me to say the following on his behalf.

<<1684.16;1689.92;en>>
I still cannot accept that humans can treat humans like that.

<<1689.92;1694.72;en>>
When my rights were violated by Spain, harm was done to me.

<<1694.72;1703.28;en>>
What I would like from this court is that measures are taken to stop such harm from being done to other people.

<<1703.28;1713.62;en>>
I would like to see that justice exists, even for those who are poor, vulnerable, and do not have a voice.

<<1713.62;1718.34;en>>
I will end on this note and give the floor to my colleague, Mr. Bollier.

<<1718.34;1719.44;en>>
Thank you very much for your attention.

Thank you very much Mr. Gericke, Mr. Boye for eight minutes please.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<1727.8;1730.76;en>>
Mr. President, Honorable Member of the Court,

<<1730.76;1742.96;en>>
Spain claims that the applicant's right should not be enforced because they could have applied for asylum at the Benin-Sar border post, the Spanish embassy, or the Spanish consulate.

<<1742.96;1756.86;en>>
As you have already heard from my colleague, the legal issue of this case is not asylum, but the opportunity to raise argument, any legal argument, against the expulsion before it is executed.

<<1756.86;1760.96;en>>
So legally, Spain's claims do not stand.

<<1760.96;1764.4;en>>
It also does not stand factually.

<<1764.4;1775.16;en>>
It is absolutely untrue that the applicants could have access to asylum through Benin-Sar, the embassy, or the consulate.

<<1775.16;1786.62;en>>
As the Kingdom of Spain knows, the processing of asylum claims at embassies and consulates awaits implementing legislation to become a reality in Spain.

<<1786.62;1791.88;en>>
I refer the Court to the EIDL report we submitted for this hearing.

<<1791.88;1808.08;en>>
In fact, the document Spain submitted on asylum claims at embassies is entitled, Asylum Claims Formulate at Embassies and Not Granted, as Spain alleged.

<<1808.08;1829.34;en>>
And as correct by Spain in Rabat, there were only 9, not 139, of such formulate claims, and all by Moroccan citizens, with no legislation or mechanism in place for these claims to actually be processed.

<<1829.34;1844.7;en>>
So the Kingdom of Spain's argument that the applicants could have access asylum at either the Rabat embassy or the Nador consulate is completely false, both legally and factually.

<<1844.7;1855.22;en>>
It is through similar distortion that Spain's tried to confuse us on access to asylum at the Benin-Sar border post at the material time.

<<1855.22;1864.78;en>>
The numbers that are relevant are those asylum claims submitted at the border as opposed to in the territory.

<<1864.78;1871.46;en>>
Therefore, the Benin-Sar crossing, the relevant numbers are at the border.

<<1871.46;1883.78;en>>
If we look at Spain's Annex 25, the third Excel table provides a list of all asylum claims made in Melilla by date and nationality.

<<1883.78;1895.42;en>>
In this document, we see first that no asylum claim was made in Melilla at the border before the 20th of September, 2014.

<<1895.42;1905.38;en>>
Second, that after that time, not a single one of the asylum seekers at the border is sub-Saharan.

<<1905.38;1911.22;en>>
Data from the Spanish Ministry of Interior confirmed that this situation did not change.

<<1911.22;1919.6;en>>
In our additional Annex 3, you will see that only two people from sub-Sahara could claim asylum at the border.

<<1919.6;1924.3;en>>
In the period from 2015 to 2017.

<<1924.3;1936.94;en>>
These were two women who escaped racial profiling by wearing full burkas, as the newspaper El Diario explained in an article submitted by us as Annex 98.

<<1936.94;1950.62;en>>
In fact, at the material time, as much as today, because of racial profiling on the Moroccan side in particular, it was not possible for sub-Saharan to even reach the border post.

<<1950.62;1957.54;en>>
This was acknowledged by the then Spanish Ministry of Interior, Mr. Soido.

<<1957.54;1961.34;en>>
I referred you to our additional Annex 2.

<<1961.34;1980.58;en>>
But also, the third-party intervention from the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and a number of reports we submitted from Amnesty International, the Spanish Ombudsperson, and the CIA, to cite a few.

<<1980.58;1990.26;en>>
This was also the experience of the applicants, who tried to hide into the crowd and access the border post, were chased by Moroccan officers.

<<1990.26;1997.7;en>>
It was the experience of some of their friends, who during similar attempts, were severely injured by Moroccan officers.

<<1997.7;2004.5;en>>
And it's also what comes out of all the evidence submitted in this case.

<<2004.5;2029.82;en>>
The confusion created by the Kingdom of Spain is another illustration of its attempt to hide the reality, that it was never possible for any sub-Saharan person, whether migrant, refugee, unaccompanied minor, or any other vulnerable person, to access the Benyansar border post, let alone climb asylum there.

<<2029.82;2039.46;en>>
And if they reach Spanish territory through the land border, these people were, and still are, automatically expelled.

<<2039.46;2044.58;en>>
This practice was turned into law in Spain in 2015.

<<2044.58;2056.1;en>>
That law has been challenged in front of the Spanish Constitutional Court, with arguments in line with the present application.

<<2056.1;2063.46;en>>
And it was the head of the current government, Mr. Pedro Sanchez, then a parliamentarian,

<<2063.46;2066.82;en>>
who filed this constitutional complaint.

<<2066.82;2069.74;en>>
So there are two different positions.

<<2069.74;2086.22;en>>
The one sustained by the representative of the Kingdom of Spain in front of this court, and a totally different one, but in line with our position, sustained from the heart by the government of Spain in front of the Constitutional Court.

<<2086.22;2094.14;en>>
We should not confuse the representation of the Kingdom of Spain with the government of Spain.

<<2094.14;2108.66;en>>
And in this line, the Spanish government trusts that you will give them the legal support it needs, the government of Spain, to comply with its obligation to respect the European Convention of Human Rights.

<<2108.66;2110.86;en>>
They are waiting for you, Your Honor.

<<2110.86;2113.94;en>>
Mr. President, honorable members of the court,

<<2113.94;2121.22;en>>
the promises of politicians may change, depending on whether they are in opposition or in power.

<<2121.22;2128.4;en>>
But the guarantees of the Spanish Constitution and those of the European Convention should be immutable.

<<2128.4;2128.42;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<2128.5;2132.42;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Boye.

<<2132.42;2134.42;en>>
Now I call Mr. Leon Cavero.

<<2134.42;2134.42;en>>
Please, you have the floor.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<2140.39;2143.07;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<2143.07;2146.99;en>>
I'm honorable members of the Grand Chamber.

<<2146.99;2155.07;en>>
Spain would like first of all to convey its gratitude for the Great Chamber for having accepted the referral before it.

<<2155.07;2178.79;en>>
My government feels concern and responsibility regarding a balanced resolution of this case in which several persons who are entitled to human rights want a balanced resolution by the Chamber.

<<2178.79;2193.79;en>>
In fact, the interests are multiple, namely first of all the interests and human rights of migrants who are enticed at their homeland by hideous mafias that earn huge profits.

<<2193.79;2219.95;en>>
It is estimated that at least 1,000 million euros a year in sub-Saharan Africa alone, and they entice migrants with the promise of the possibility of unlawfully entering to the European territory due to flaws in border control.

<<2219.95;2240.87;en>>
They often leave at their fate migrants in deserted areas to die, and they even submit them to several types of exploitation and abuse even when they have reached the European territory.

<<2240.87;2257.87;en>>
So the first thing that the government is concerned about is about the signal that the decision of this court may have enhancing the outrageous interests of mafias who profit from this.

<<2257.87;2277.01;en>>
Secondly, the rights and the enjoyment of human rights by people residing and in transit in Europe whose peaceful enjoyment of human rights depends on the orderly management of migration flaws.

<<2277.01;2287.47;en>>
It is well known that terrorist organizations and organized crime in general takes profit of flaws in border management.

<<2287.47;2310.07;en>>
And thirdly, women and men who make the hard work of border control, whose lives and personal integrity might be endangered senselessly if a resolution is not well balanced.

<<2310.07;2330.35;en>>
In fact, Article 17 and Article 53 of the Convention oblige all of us to make interpretation of the Convention which is balanced for all the human rights that might be at question in a particular case.

<<2330.35;2349.71;en>>
Here it is not only Article 4 of Protocol 4, but Article 2 and Article 3, the respect of the life and personal integrity of all Europeans who are living in European territory.

<<2349.71;2365.75;en>>
Spain is quite conscious of its positive obligations deriving from the Convention and in fact it has showed a deep attachment to these positive obligations.

<<2365.75;2407.43;en>>
Recently this summer, Spain gave shelter and safe harbor to a rescue ship well beyond its strict international obligations and nowadays it has made an agreement with a rescue NGO, the Open Arms, in order to coordinate the efforts of the Spanish rescue fleet together with that of NGOs in order to enhance the rescue of migrants at sea, not only in territorial waters but also in international waters.

<<2407.43;2438.59;en>>
But at the same time, my government considers that a non-balanced resolution of this case and we humbly believe that the resolution given by the Chamber is not balanced, might only go on behalf of these hideous mafias and against the human rights of migrants, European citizens and members of border control.

<<2438.59;2463.71;en>>
Secondly we are concerned also about a quite interesting and important procedural issue, which is that the Conventional system is based on the right of individual application and it cannot give shelter to mere actual popularists that may give or put a spanner in the wheels of the Conventional system.

<<2463.71;2481.91;en>>
So we do not think that this Court should engage in cases that do not have real interest from the part of the applicant and that take part of what is called a strategic litigation.

<<2481.91;2500.63;en>>
So coming to the subject of the instant case, we want to signal two basic facts which have been more than proved by Spain and that are quite important and indispensable for the resolution in law of this case.

<<2500.63;2509.83;en>>
First of all is that both applicants did not come from an unsafe country.

<<2509.83;2520.95;en>>
We must recall the inadmissibility decision of 7th July 2015 of the Chamber, which is final and has not been challenged.

<<2520.95;2533.55;en>>
In that decision the Chamber considers manifestly ill-founded the claim of a breach of Article 3 together with Article 13 of the Convention.

<<2533.55;2551.79;en>>
It is to say the Chamber establishes as fact that it has not been proved at all that any ill-treatment had come either from the Spanish forces or from the Moroccan forces.

<<2551.79;2558.51;en>>
And this is a final decision and it is a departing fact which cannot be unknown.

<<2558.51;2572.91;en>>
Secondly, as a proof of this, there are positive declarations regarding the Moroccan efforts to integrate migrants and asylum seekers.

<<2572.91;2640.55;en>>
It is not only Moroccan legislation and the signature and ratification long time ago by Morocco of international agreements, the Geneva Convention in particular, and also the establishment in the long time ago of the Bureau des Réfugiés Abattris, the BRA, but also the declarations made by Anne Brasseur in her capacity of President of the Parliamentarian Assembly of the Council of Europe made in December 2015 regarding the efforts of the Moroccan authorities in this sense, and also the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees, who is long time deployed in Rabat with a big office, who made an agreement with the Moroccan government in 2007, who has a web page where it praises the efforts and the real possibility of requesting asylum in Morocco.

<<2640.55;2659.47;en>>
But also there are the Spanish Committee for Help for the Refugees, which is a third party intervener who says in page 3 of its submission that Morocco rectified its asylum system in 2013.

<<2659.47;2675.03;en>>
Also in footnote 17 of the applicant's submission to this Grand Chamber where it says that the refugee system in Morocco was working effectively in 2013 and 2014.

<<2675.03;2684.87;en>>
We must note that Mr. N'Di could request asylum in the Rabat offices because according to

<<2684.87;2702.47;en>>
his own account, he lived in Rabat from April 2012 to December 2013, a fact which is curiously skipped by Mr. Boyer and Mr. Krikke in their submissions.

<<2702.47;2716.73;en>>
And also we must note that according to footnote 28 of the applicant's submissions to the Grand Chamber, Mr. N'Di, who is a national of Ivory Coast, did not need a visa to lawfully enter

<<2716.73;2728.85;en>>
and lawfully stay in Morocco, so he was residing lawfully in Morocco at the date that presumably the facts took place.

<<2728.85;2735.31;en>>
The second fact which is important is that the applicants never bore valid legal grounds to request asylum.

<<2735.31;2750.11;en>>
And as a consequence, it is more than proof that they migrate for economic reasons and that the principle of non-refoulement is not applicable in this case.

<<2750.11;2755.23;en>>
Regarding Mr. N'Di, Mr. Boyer is his lawyer since December 2014.

<<2755.23;2765.33;en>>
This is four months before the claim was posted before the court.

<<2765.33;2770.47;en>>
He has never requested asylum on behalf of Mr. N'Di.

<<2770.47;2774.73;en>>
He hasn't done this so far until now.

<<2774.73;2782.83;en>>
He did not seek judicial review against the disbursing order that reached the final status.

<<2782.83;2788.27;en>>
And Mr. N'Di fled to an unknown place.

<<2788.27;2795.99;en>>
As regarding Mr. N'Di, he didn't request asylum when he finally entered unlawfully in Spain

<<2795.99;2801.63;en>>
late in 2014.

<<2801.63;2819.39;en>>
He only requested asylum for instrumental reasons when the decision on expulsion was final because he knew that the law on asylum of Spain stays automatically expulsion once asylum is requested.

<<2819.39;2833.31;en>>
According to Spanish law, two reports were requested from the United Nations High Commissioner for the Refugees Office in Spain regarding the possible right to asylum of Mr. N'Di.

<<2833.31;2848.27;en>>
And we have transcripted the two reports made by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for the Refugees, which are quite clear in the sense that there is no ground for him to request asylum.

<<2848.27;2857.11;en>>
In fact, he returned to Mali in 2015 with the knowledge and consent of the Malian consular authorities.

<<2857.11;2859.43;en>>
He has lived there ever since.

<<2859.43;2865.91;en>>
And to date, no danger has been reported against his person.

<<2865.91;2880.11;en>>
So we are concerned with a case regarding Article 4 and Protocol 4, which does not have any connection with Article 3.

<<2880.11;2887.27;en>>
And therefore, the principle of non-reformo is not applicable at all.

<<2887.27;2891.03;en>>
Now we'll go to the law.

<<2891.03;2895.79;en>>
First of all, we will expose our procedural grounds.

<<2895.79;2899.59;en>>
And the first one is the lack of proof of victim status.

<<2899.59;2929.15;en>>
The Chamber says that facts are proved because the applicants gave a coherent account of the circumstances, which was supported with video footage that appears credible, because the government did not deny, quote, summary expulsions, a later amended internal law, and because the government cannot profit from the non-identification, as it is the government to blame for it.

<<2929.15;2931.31;en>>
But we must say the following.

<<2931.31;2935.15;en>>
First of all, proof of participation.

<<2935.15;2942.15;en>>
The applicants only say that they appear in certain parts of the video footage.

<<2942.15;2954.19;en>>
In order to prove that, any lawyer knows that it must furnish, first of all, photo of the applicants, so that it can be matched with the video footage.

<<2954.19;2960.83;en>>
But if we look at the applications, there is no photograph of Mr. N.T. in the applications

<<2960.83;2962.11;en>>
annexed.

<<2962.11;2970.79;en>>
And as regards Mr. N.D., what is annexed is a blurred photocopy of an identity card, where

<<2970.79;2974.83;en>>
it is impossible to see the face.

<<2974.83;2979.99;en>>
Was it possible to furnish a photograph of the applicants with the applications?

<<2979.99;2985.43;en>>
We consider that it was quite possible, and it was indispensable to make matching.

<<2985.43;3007.43;en>>
So Spain wanted to collaborate with the justice in this case, and that is why it took the high-quality ID photographs, which were taken when months later they unlawfully trespassed the border, and gave those photographs to the court.

<<3007.43;3012.59;en>>
They have not been challenged so far that these are right photographs.

<<3012.59;3028.87;en>>
On top of that, Spain took the costs of making an expert report by experts which have been recognized European-wide for being very good forensic experts.

<<3028.87;3041.71;en>>
And the conclusion was that it was not possible to make the matching, and they took all images and they put them as neat as they could be, and it was impossible.

<<3041.71;3051.51;en>>
This was four years ago, and in these four years, the applicants and the applicants' lawyers could have furnished an alternative expert report.

<<3051.51;3055.87;en>>
We are still waiting for it.

<<3055.87;3069.27;en>>
So we consider that it was possible to make the identification, but the applicants have not furnished their burden of proof.

<<3069.27;3075.99;en>>
Secondly, there are contradictory accounts of the facts in the applications.

<<3075.99;3099.45;en>>
The applicants' lawyers talk about very dramatic circumstances, and between these dramatic circumstances, it is said that one of the applicants broke his leg in the summer, and that the other, before climbing, received a stone throw and hit the soil, almost breaking his leg.

<<3099.45;3119.75;en>>
So how was it possible if they said that one says that he had his leg broken, and the other says that he was badly injured while attempting to climb the first fence, to climb the three fences, and stay so many hours on top of the third fence?

<<3119.75;3128.23;en>>
So there are contradictions on the account of facts which come from reading the application only.

<<3128.23;3143.67;en>>
Third, Spain has never recognized summary expulsions, as the judgment says, but only that it has acted to prevent entry, which is quite a different thing.

<<3143.67;3151.55;en>>
And this recognition does not have anything to do with the proof of the facts.

<<3151.55;3162.47;en>>
Also the theoretical testimony of third parties who were or not at the facts cannot serve as a confirmation.

<<3162.47;3169.73;en>>
And as to the non-assessment of domestic remedies, it is the applicants to blame, as we will later expose.

<<3169.73;3199.91;en>>
So there are not strong, clear, and concordant inferences of similar and rebutted presumptions of fact that serve to support the participation of the applicants on the facts, as it is required by Para 264 of the Great Chamber Judgment in Oran versus Turkey, which is precisely cited by the applicants in their submissions.

<<3199.91;3216.11;en>>
So according to the Great Chamber Judgment on Borden versus the UK, Paras 33 and 29, the applicants have not shown, and it was possible, that they were directly affected.

<<3216.11;3241.63;en>>
And if they have not shown or proved that they were directly affected, the Convention does not envisage, quote, the bringing of an act to popularize for the interpretation of the rights it contains or permit individuals to complain about a provision of domestic law simply because they consider, without having been directly affected by it, that it may contravene the Convention.

<<3241.63;3248.47;en>>
And nonexistence of victim status before the date of filing the application.

<<3248.47;3252.95;en>>
The application was filed on the 17th February 2015.

<<3252.95;3281.73;en>>
And at that moment, the decision of the court was useless to the applicants because, first of all, they didn't, at that time it was clear, and it had been reported by the United Nations High Commissioner of the Refugee, that ND didn't have right for asylum, and NT had never requested asylum, and their decisions were internal decisions and internal proceedings had already taken place.

<<3281.73;3312.27;en>>
So we must cite paragraph 253 of the CLAIFIA and others versus Italy, where it is said that if the lodgers are unable to indicate the slightest factor or legal ground which, under international or national law, could have justified their client's presence on the member state territory and preclude their removal, then an individual interview is useless.

<<3312.27;3321.51;en>>
This apart from the fact that the applicants' lodgers have not proved to have any contact with the applicants from the outset of their proceedings.

<<3321.51;3334.35;en>>
Mr. Bollier, in the internal proceedings in December 2014, posts a player where, while

<<3334.35;3342.11;en>>
trying to defend Mr. NT, he refers to another person of different nationality and different

<<3342.11;3345.11;en>>
name.

<<3345.11;3349.23;en>>
They have not given even the address of the persons.

<<3349.23;3362.75;en>>
They have not proved any contact with the persons, and we must refer to the Great Chamber judgment in BM and others versus Belgium, which is referred to in the questions posed by the Grand Chamber.

<<3362.75;3369.31;en>>
Third, lack of association of available and effective internal remedies.

<<3369.31;3379.63;en>>
We must say that this is an important part of the functioning of the conventional system.

<<3379.63;3399.87;en>>
Borders, factual or legal, are not an obstacle per se to the exhaustion of domestic remedies, and applicants living outside the jurisdiction of a contracting state are not exempted from exhausting them, as it has said the Grand Chamber in Demopoulos and others versus Turkey, paragraphs 98 and 101.

<<3399.87;3421.31;en>>
So the government burden is to prove that there are remedies, and once we prove that effective and available, then the applicant has to show that has exhausted them, and the mere doubts on effectiveness are not absolved from this obligation.

<<3421.31;3429.27;en>>
And in particular with Article 4 of Protocol 4, in the Glaifia judgment, par. 240, the

<<3429.27;3442.27;en>>
court has said that there is no violation of Article 4 of Protocol 4 where the lack of individual aspiration decision can be attributable to the culpable conduct of the person concerned.

<<3442.27;3461.03;en>>
And in Hirshihama judgment, versus Italy, paragraph 177, it is said that, unlike what happens with people coming from the sea, when they come by land, they may be able to pose that kind of remedies.

<<3461.03;3470.95;en>>
Spain has only to prove that there was one remedy available, but Spain has proved that it is not only one, but three remedies which are available.

<<3470.95;3478.03;en>>
First of all, requesting an entry visa from the country of origin of any country.

<<3478.03;3488.55;en>>
Nobody has ever proved or pled that this is not possible according to European Union and national law.

<<3488.55;3497.11;en>>
What would any of the people seated in this hall do if they wanted to go to Mali or to Ivory Coast?

<<3497.11;3506.11;en>>
They would seek that kind of visas and not unlawfully try to trespass the border.

<<3506.11;3516.51;en>>
In fact, we have not only that legislation, but bilateral treaties for working visas with Mali and quotas with Ivory Coast.

<<3516.51;3527.75;en>>
And we have proved by statistics that in the relevant period, 34 Malians and 34 nationals of Ivory Coast entered into Spain through this kind of visa.

<<3527.75;3548.31;en>>
But on top of that, in 2013, 1,597 people requested a visa from Ivory Coast and 776 people requested a visa for entry from Mali.

<<3548.31;3558.03;en>>
Similar figures are for 2014, and we have furnished the court and the other parties today with the data.

<<3558.03;3562.83;en>>
Second, requesting entry at the Spanish consulates or embassies.

<<3562.83;3569.43;en>>
What I trust about this is the Spanish official gazette and the law and regulation existing.

<<3569.43;3578.23;en>>
Article 38 of the Law on Asylum of 2009 establishes clearly that it is possible to request asylum at embassies and consulates.

<<3578.23;3585.31;en>>
And the regulation of 1995 is applicable until a new regulation is adopted.

<<3585.31;3593.55;en>>
So we have to look at the articles, which are 416 and 29.4 of Royal Decree of 1995,

<<3593.55;3601.59;en>>
together with the circular to embassies and consulates that we have furnished the court with, to apply these articles.

<<3601.59;3609.39;en>>
And according to this legislation, it is possible to file these in consulates and embassies.

<<3609.39;3641.71;en>>
If there is urgency, which can be appreciated by the Spanish officer of the United Nations High Commissioner of the Refugee, which can make a request to Spain, or by the ambassador having the person in presence, then there is transfer to Spain, immediate transfer to Spain, given the travel documents needed.

<<3641.71;3667.59;en>>
And if there are no urgent cases, then the ambassador will evaluate the danger and will make interviews, and if he considers that there is seriousness in the application, will refer to the Interministerial Commission for Asylum and Refuge, which has to deliver a decision in six months' time, and that decision can be subject to judicial review.

<<3667.59;3675.15;en>>
So it is real, the existence of this possibility in the law and regulations.

<<3675.15;3688.99;en>>
And in the period of 2014-2018, 1,308 were granted, nine in Morocco, four in 2014.

<<3688.99;3695.71;en>>
Requesting asylum, 30, at authorized border crossings of Benin and Sar.

<<3695.71;3699.35;en>>
This is possible according to Spanish and European law.

<<3699.35;3721.07;en>>
Before the 13th of August 2014, the persons who wanted to seek asylum were accompanied to the religious police station, and we have furnished the data before 13th August 2014, which is 21 requested in police stations, and six came from the border crossing.

<<3721.07;3726.71;en>>
So it was possible, and two of them came from Ivory Coast.

<<3726.71;3741.75;en>>
To discredit this, it is said that the number of sub-Saharans is very small, due to unidentified sources that say that someone prevents sub-Saharans to reach the border post.

<<3741.75;3761.71;en>>
But this is, to apart the view from the most plausible explanation, which is that this is economic migration, and this is why they do not bear legal grounds for refuge, and then they don't request asylum.

<<3761.71;3770.23;en>>
Economic migration is understandable, and it raises most humanitarian concerns.

<<3770.23;3787.31;en>>
But this calls for an orderly management of migration flows, and this follows from the global compact on safe, orderly, and regular migration, which is going to be submitted to final consideration by the General Assembly of the United Nations this December.

<<3787.31;3792.67;en>>
It is not unlawful trespassing of the borders the solution for this.

<<3792.67;3795.91;en>>
And secondly, who would be to blame?

<<3795.91;3801.23;en>>
The SEAR submission as third party has been clear.

<<3801.23;3814.63;en>>
It says, quote, since the Moroccan authorities prevent these people from accessing Benin's SEAR office, we don't know if this is real or not, but the SEAR blames the Moroccan authorities, and Spain is not to blame for Moroccan activities.

<<3814.63;3822.67;en>>
And even Mr. Boye today has said that it is the Moroccan authorities that presumably impede

<<3822.67;3825.91;en>>
these people to arriving to the Benin-Saharan border.

<<3825.91;3833.39;en>>
We doubt it, because in the official data we have furnished, there are people from sub-Saharan countries that is coming.

<<3833.39;3837.39;en>>
On jurisdiction, we won't make any further point.

<<3837.39;3865.99;en>>
It is already said in our written submissions, but we only want, also in the submission of the Belgian, Italian, and French government, only we want to put to the consideration of the court that according to the position of the applicants, just standing on Spanish territory and touching the first wall, full jurisdiction will be established.

<<3865.99;3870.87;en>>
We don't consider that this is reasonable.

<<3870.87;3882.49;en>>
And we will go to the late point, the latest point, which is the inexistence of violation of Article 4, Protocol 4, and of Article 13 in relation to this.

<<3882.49;3885.35;en>>
I will give a lightning example.

<<3885.35;3892.63;en>>
Suppose you are at home with your couple of children, you are caring, supportive, and humanitarian.

<<3892.63;3902.79;en>>
You would give entry to any person in danger or in need to your home just if they knock at the door and explain the reasons.

<<3902.79;3909.15;en>>
And suddenly you see 600 strong men come in menacing to break your windows.

<<3909.15;3915.95;en>>
And then your reaction is to close the windows and to secure shutters and blinds.

<<3915.95;3924.07;en>>
So refraining from the use of weapons and still keeping the door open through normal means.

<<3924.07;3929.27;en>>
So are you preventing entry to your house or are you espousing people?

<<3929.27;3933.07;en>>
Who is being violent and unlawful?

<<3933.07;3941.47;en>>
Who has not been willing to comply with reasonable requirements of entry and who has not?

<<3941.47;3948.79;en>>
So if we go to the legal question which is behind this tale, expulsion.

<<3948.79;3963.63;en>>
In the explanatory memorandum of the Convention, expulsion was devised to avoid the shameful crimes which happened in Europe in the 19th century and in part of the 20th century.

<<3963.63;3968.59;en>>
So it was devised for persons who were in the territory of the state in issue.

<<3968.59;3972.21;en>>
This was the initial drafting of the article.

<<3972.21;3980.71;en>>
You have recognized that in your judgment of His Ijamaa, paragraph 167.

<<3980.71;3991.55;en>>
Then you made the first expansion of this subjective and objective scope of article 4 or protocol 4 in His Ijamaa.

<<3991.55;3998.19;en>>
In that case, you were before persons in danger in the country of provenance.

<<3998.19;4004.47;en>>
So article 3 was taken in connection with article 4, protocol 4.

<<4004.47;4013.99;en>>
And the persons were in international waters and there was an obligation to let them in by the international law of the sea.

<<4013.99;4020.27;en>>
And they came inside the territory of the Italian state through an Italian sea.

<<4020.27;4027.47;en>>
So in fact, this is a case where the persons were inside the territory of the state.

<<4027.47;4032.99;en>>
The same happens in Claifia and others versus Italy and in Sarifi versus Austria.

<<4032.99;4041.31;en>>
People had entered in the territory and then you examine whether the expansion proceedings comply or not with the Convention.

<<4041.31;4050.35;en>>
But here we are confronted with a possible second expansion anew of article 4 or protocol 4.

<<4050.35;4050.63;en>>
Because...

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4049.69;4052.33;en>>
Excuse me, Mr. Leon, can I ask you to conclude, please?

[[Government;GR1]]

<<4052.33;4052.33;en>>
Yes.

<<4054.39;4058.59;en>>
These persons come by land and could request lawful entry.

<<4058.59;4064.53;en>>
These persons do not bear legal grounds to request refuge, so no reform in this applicable.

<<4064.53;4069.99;en>>
They come from a secure third country, Morocco, where they could lawfully request asylum.

<<4069.99;4078.59;en>>
They willfully perform an act of massive violent and lawful trespassing, and they are prevented from entry by the use of proportionate obstacle.

<<4078.59;4082.59;en>>
Is this in conformity with international law?

<<4082.59;4087.25;en>>
First of all, there is no legal right to enter in a state from outside.

<<4087.25;4090.51;en>>
You have said that in Neda versus Switzerland.

<<4090.51;4103.23;en>>
Second, Spain has the international obligation to prevent an authorized entry to its territory, which is Sengen territory, according to a treaty on the function of the European Union and the Sengen border code.

<<4103.23;4110.75;en>>
Thirdly, attacks are acts against the principles of the United Nations, Article 51 of the UN Charter.

<<4110.75;4127.47;en>>
And Article 2 of the draft articles on the sparsing of aliens say that the non-admission of an alien to the state is not included in the concept of sparsing.

<<4127.47;4159.67;en>>
And in fact, to avoid fragmentation of human right protection, you might take into account that relevant member states have not ratified so far Protocol 4, such as Greece, Turkey, UK, and Switzerland, that the comments made by the relevant European states and other states within the Sixth Commission regarding the negotiation of the draft articles are clear in the sense that regarding border control, there can be no sparsing under international law.

<<4159.67;4171.07;en>>
And we refer to Sweden, talking on behalf of all Nordic countries, Romania, Hungary, Russia, Switzerland, Germany, UK, Netherlands, Australia, and Malaysia.

<<4171.07;4176.63;en>>
That is why the Sengen Border Code distinguishes between preventing entry action against illegal entry.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4176.39;4179.69;en>>
I'm sorry, but I ask you to conclude, please.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<4180.43;4181.59;en>>
Sorry.

<<4181.59;4186.75;en>>
So just to conclude, we consider that there has not been expulsion.

<<4186.75;4194.71;en>>
Expulsion has not been collective in the sense that there have been internal remedies and possibilities to request.

<<4194.71;4200.35;en>>
And Article 13 must decay as there is no violation of Article 4 of Protocol 4.

<<4200.35;4203.63;en>>
Sorry for the little delay.

<<4203.63;4206.79;en>>
And thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4207.37;4210.45;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Leon Cavero.

<<4210.45;4216.41;en>>
And now I call the European Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mijatović, to the floor,please.

[[ThirdParty;TP2]]

<<4224.04;4228.24;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court,

<<4228.24;4235.64;en>>
this is my first appearance before this Court since the beginning of my mandate in April this year.

<<4235.64;4252.08;en>>
It is based on the work of my predecessor, Nils Mužnjak, in particular the written comments he submitted to this Court in November 2015 and March 2018 concerning the case you are hearing today.

<<4252.08;4263.44;en>>
His work included a visit to Melilla and Madrid in January 2015, as well as continuous monitoring work and dialogue with the Spanish authorities.

<<4263.44;4276.88;en>>
I have decided to take part in this hearing because of the special importance this case has for the protection of the human rights of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees.

<<4276.88;4290.96;en>>
While migration-related issues are omnipresent in the public debate, it has become increasingly difficult for those in need of protection to reach Europe in a safe and legal way.

<<4290.96;4305.54;en>>
And perhaps most worryingly, there appears to be a growing assumption that those who cross borders in an irregular manner should not be entitled to human rights protection.

<<4305.54;4320.06;en>>
This is unethical to the principle reiterated by this Court that states have the right to control migration but must do so in full respect of their Convention obligations.

<<4320.06;4335.8;en>>
In a context so clearly marked by risk of rolling back essential protection, ensuring that states act in accordance with the Court's case law became one of the top priorities of my office.

<<4335.8;4341.48;en>>
Our work has focused on a number of key rights at stake in today's case.

<<4341.48;4346.82;en>>
Firstly, the right to be protected against collective expulsion.

<<4346.82;4360.88;en>>
Across Europe, we are witnessing a multiplication of summary expulsion of migrants and potential asylum seekers without an assessment of the individual circumstances of each and every person.

<<4360.88;4375.0;en>>
These expulsions happen at land borders and at sea, at borders between Member States and non-Member States of the Council of Europe, but also at borders between Council of Europe Member States.

<<4375.0;4390.92;en>>
My predecessor repeatedly raised concerns regarding such summary expulsions, including with the authorities of Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Spain and Switzerland, each time aiming to uphold the basic principles set out by this Court.

<<4390.92;4405.9;en>>
Crucially, the work of my office has been based on the premise that the prohibition of collective expulsion applies to all, regardless of whether they claim asylum or enter the Member State in an irregular manner.

<<4405.9;4421.64;en>>
My office has also followed the Court's lead by addressing the prohibition of collective expulsion not only in cases where the persons have entered the territory of a Member State, but also when they had been refused admission.

<<4421.64;4430.34;en>>
In line with the Court's finding in Sharifi and others, that Article 4, Protocol 4 also applied in that situation.

<<4430.34;4436.36;en>>
In this context, I want to highlight the crucial contribution of the Court's case law in two respects.

<<4436.36;4460.84;en>>
Firstly, its recognition, in particular in Hirsi Jamma, that the protection provided by the Convention must adapt to changing migration patterns and border control practices, with the aim of ensuring that guarantees for migrants, asylum seekers and refugees remain practical and effective, and do not become theoretical and illusory.

<<4460.84;4477.22;en>>
And secondly, that the challenges States meet in managing migratory flows cannot justify practices incompatible with obligations under the Convention, as this Court has clearly stated in Hirsi Jamma and in Georgia v. Russia.

<<4477.22;4488.8;en>>
A second area of work is a separate but related issue of protection against refoulement, including by ensuring access to asylum procedure.

<<4488.8;4509.52;en>>
Again my Office has on several occasions reminded Member States of this Court's case law, establishing that Convention obligations with regards to non-refoulement can also be triggered when a State intercepts a person before they can enter their territory, provided they were under the effective control of the State.

<<4509.52;4515.44;en>>
In light of all this, I now want to share a number of observations on the situation in Spain.

<<4515.44;4531.32;en>>
My predecessor visited Melilla and Benrit in January 2015 in a context marked by consistent reports of regular summary returns to Morocco of migrants having climbed the fence surrounding the city of Melilla.

<<4531.32;4542.48;en>>
All information gathered during the visit pointed to the existence of an established practice of immediate expulsion of migrants, most of them sub-Saharan.

<<4542.48;4551.68;en>>
Once they come down from the fence without any individualised or reasoned written decision or an assessment of their protection needs.

<<4551.68;4559.62;en>>
Following this visit, we continued to receive reports of summary expulsions at the borders of Ceuta and Melilla.

<<4559.62;4574.42;en>>
In a letter of July 2016 to the Spanish Minister of the Interior, my predecessor reiterated his concerns about these expulsions, which in practice also deprived migrants of any possibility to seek asylum.

<<4574.42;4584.56;en>>
The practice of summary returns was given legal underpinning through the adoption in 2015 of amendments to the legislation on foreigners.

<<4584.56;4602.28;en>>
These amendments fell short of providing clear guarantees against collective expulsions and reforms, including the right to be identified, to have one's protection needs assessed and to have access to an interpreter and to legal assistance.

<<4602.28;4616.44;en>>
Apart from raising serious concerns in relation to the prohibition of collective expulsion and reform, the practice I have just described also has obvious implications for the right to an effective remedy.

<<4616.44;4627.8;en>>
Since they are immediately expelled to Morocco, those affected do not have access to any procedure in Spain to request a review of the expulsion decision.

<<4627.8;4639.8;en>>
Even if they did have access to such a procedure, the lack of an individualized and reasoned written expulsion order would make it impossible to start such review proceedings.

<<4639.8;4646.4;en>>
Finally I would like to conclude my intervention by addressing two arguments that have been raised in this case.

<<4646.4;4660.16;en>>
Firstly, the argument that persons intercepted on or near the fence cannot be considered as having entered Spain and should therefore not benefit from the protection of the Convention.

<<4660.16;4671.48;en>>
As noted in my predecessor's written comments, official bodies and the Court in Spain have asserted that the border fences are indeed on Spanish territory.

<<4671.48;4689.88;en>>
But irrespective of that, I note that this Court has found in Sharifi and others that the question whether the applicants had de facto entered Italy or had been refused admission was irrelevant, since the protection against collective expulsion would apply in either case.

<<4689.88;4702.92;en>>
This Court has also found a violation of the prohibition of collective expulsion in cases of migrants intercepted outside the territory of a member state on the basis that the authorities had effective control.

<<4702.92;4714.54;en>>
All information available indicates that persons who have scaled the border fences and subsequently climbed down are apprehended and removed by the Spanish authorities.

<<4714.54;4726.78;en>>
At no point has my office received information that any other state's authorities shared control over those apprehended until the moment they were handed over to the Moroccan authorities.

<<4726.78;4732.56;en>>
The second issue is the argument that the applicants could have applied for asylum.

<<4732.56;4737.48;en>>
In my view, this should not distract attention from the actual situation at stake.

<<4737.48;4746.24;en>>
The applicants alleged have tried to enter Malia by crossing the border fence and having been apprehended in this process.

<<4746.24;4753.16;en>>
The basic question should be whether their right to be protected against collective expulsion was violated at that point.

<<4753.16;4760.48;en>>
The fact that the applicants could have theoretically taken another course of action should bear no relevance.

<<4760.48;4770.98;en>>
However, let me stress that applying for asylum in Malia through regular channels seems practically impossible for the sub-Saharan Africans.

<<4770.98;4788.48;en>>
As highlighted by many, including my predecessor, the Spanish National Ombudsperson, and most recently the Council of Europe's Secretary General's Special Representative on Migration and Refugees, migrants of sub-Saharan origin are prevented from accessing the border post on the Moroccan side.

<<4788.48;4794.92;en>>
It means that in practice they cannot access the official Spanish asylum office at Beny al-Zahra border post either.

<<4794.92;4805.8;en>>
Thus, they are left with the option of climbing over the fence, taking the sea, or using a regular means of crossing the border point.

<<4805.8;4827.16;en>>
One could also note that migrants intercepted on or near the fence could in principle be brought by the Guardia Civil to the border post and asylum office of Beny al-Zahra so that they can formally be identified and, if necessary, introduce an asylum application at the appropriate place.

<<4827.16;4831.52;en>>
However, to my knowledge, this has never been done so far.

<<4831.52;4847.24;en>>
I will conclude my comments by reiterating that protection against collective expulsion and against refoulement, as well as access to effective remedies, are crucial components of migration control system that is human rights compliant.

<<4847.24;4864.44;en>>
However, the practice of summary returns to Morocco of migrants who attempt to enter Melilla by climbing the fence deprives them of the possibility of being identified and having their individual situation duly assessed and having access to an effective remedy.

<<4864.44;4869.84;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court, I hope my comments will be helpful

<<4869.84;4869.84;en>>
to the Court, and I thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4874.02;4877.02;en>>
Thank you very much, Madam Commissioner.

<<4877.02;4882.02;en>>
And now I call the representative of the UNHCR.

<<4882.02;4883.02;en>>
Mrs. O’hara, please, you have the floor.

[[ThirdParty;TP1]]

<<4887.97;4893.73;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished judges, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for

<<4893.73;4908.17;en>>
Refugees thanks the Court for allowing us to intervene as a third party, and it's an honour for me as Director of the Division of International Protection to present UNHCR's views here today.

<<4908.17;4939.25;en>>
This submission is made in the exercise of UNHCR's mandate, and in particular supervisory responsibility in accordance with its statute and Article 35 of the 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees, as the present case raises issues of law and state practice regarding the scope and the implications of the non-refoulement obligation under international refugee and human rights law.

<<4939.25;4952.09;en>>
My comments are also informed by our detailed knowledge of the situation at the CETA and Melilla enclaves. The present case is of particular interest to UNHCR and to many Member States

<<4952.29;4964.27;en>>
of the Council of Europe as it deals with pushback practices or return arrangements at a land border. UNHCR recognises of course the sovereign right of states to establish

<<4964.27;4977.05;en>>
their own immigration policies provided they are in compliance with their treaty obligations, including those arising from the 1951 Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights.

<<4977.05;4994.53;en>>
As this Court has repeatedly indicated, problems and new challenges facing European states in terms of migration cannot justify practices incompatible with the standards set out in the European Convention on Human Rights.

<<4994.53;5033.89;en>>
This submission will expand and elaborate upon UNHCR's key positions reflected in our written interventions regarding, firstly, the situation at the CETA and Melilla enclaves, in particular the lack of access for asylum applicants from sub-Saharan Africa to any identification procedures enabling an individual assessment of their situation in the context of summary returns, and secondly, the scope and content of the prohibition of collective expulsion and its implications regarding non-refoulement under international refugee and human rights law.

<<5033.89;5048.41;en>>
Allow me first briefly to describe the situation in Melilla and CETA on the basis of UNHCR's observations. UNHCR was asked by the Court by way of letter dated 16 August 2018 whether

<<5048.41;5062.25;en>>
and I quote, the applicants at the time of the events had a real possibility to access the border checkpoint of Beni Ensar and request asylum there, end quote.

<<5062.25;5076.25;en>>
As a third party intervener, UNHCR does not pronounce itself on the claims of the individual applicants. However, as outlined in our written interventions, UNHCR reiterates that at the

<<5076.25;5106.29;en>>
material time of the incidents at issue in the present case and up to November 2014, when authorised asylum border posts were created by the Spanish authorities, there was no mechanism in place for persons seeking international protection, either at Beni Ensar, the main Melilla-Morocco border crossing point, or anywhere else, to safely access the territory of Spain in order to apply for asylum.

<<5106.29;5143.03;en>>
Furthermore, prior to that date, the procedural guarantees provided for in the national law, which include individual identification, access to a lawyer and an interpreter in cases of the return of foreigners who attempt to enter Spain through an unauthorised border crossing, provided for in the 2009 Aliens Act and its regulations, had not been properly implemented at Melilla and Ceuta, resulting in summary returns or pushbacks in breach of the aforementioned procedural guarantees.

<<5143.03;5148.81;en>>
The Court further asked UNHCR, and I quote, if at the time of the events, i.e. prior to

<<5148.81;5171.61;en>>
the 1st of September 2014, what were the reasons for the alleged impossibility or difficulties referred to by some of the third parties, the Human Rights Commissioner, UNHCR or CEAR, for persons from sub-Saharan Africa to access the Spanish Embassy in Rabat or the Spanish Consulate in Nador, end quote.

<<5171.61;5209.05;en>>
In response to this question, UNHCR wishes to inform the Court that notwithstanding Article 38 of the Spanish Asylum Law, promulgated in October 2009, which grants the Ambassador of Spain discretion to allow persons whose physical integrity is at risk or are in need of international protection to be transferred to Spain to apply for such, no procedure for seeking international protection in a Spanish Consulate or Embassy has been established or applied for, except for family reunification purposes with recognised refugees in Spain.

<<5209.05;5244.57;en>>
UNHCR has expressed concerns that despite the amendments to the Aliens Act, which came into force on 1st of April 2015, after the incidents at issue in the present case, the newly introduced concept of rejection at the border at Melilla and Ceuta are not carried out in compliance with international refugee law and European human rights standards, because the duty to ensure a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual alien has not been fully implemented in practice.

<<5244.57;5255.21;en>>
We have commented further on this as set out in our written submission at PARA 222 and supplementary observations at PARA 213.

<<5255.21;5270.93;en>>
The failure to have this reasonable and objective examination may, in certain circumstances, lead to the violation of the obligation of non-refoulement under international refugee and human rights law.

<<5270.93;5290.65;en>>
UNHCR is further concerned that access to the territory and a fair and efficient asylum procedure, including where relevant an admissibility procedure at the Melilla border crossing, is in practice only available to persons from Middle East and North African countries.

<<5290.65;5297.53;en>>
Access is virtually impossible for Sub-Saharan Africans who are prevented from approaching the border area.

<<5297.53;5312.57;en>>
Statistics from the Spanish authorities indicate that 12,700 asylum seekers from Middle Eastern and North African countries have been registered by the Spanish authorities at the Benin-Zaar border post since the end of 2014.

<<5312.57;5328.45;en>>
In contrast, approximately only 35 asylum seekers from Sub-Saharan African countries were registered during the same period, and only because they managed to enter the enclave not through the Benin-Zaar border, but by other means.

<<5328.45;5341.89;en>>
UNHCR observes further that to date, not a single person of any nationality has been able to claim asylum at El Tarajal, the main border crossing between Ceuta and Morocco.

<<5341.89;5356.25;en>>
Since the entry into force of the amendment to the Aliens Act on 1 April 2015, summary returns or pushbacks at the Melilla and Ceuta land borders continue to be reported on a regular basis.

<<5356.25;5375.45;en>>
UNHCR estimates that 1,500 persons were summarily returned by the Spanish border authorities, the Guardia Civil, without any proper individual identification procedure in several incidents in Ceuta and Melilla since that date.

<<5375.45;5380.05;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished judges, allow me now to elaborate briefly on the scope and

<<5380.05;5391.01;en>>
the content of the prohibition of collective expulsions to show why the situation at the Melilla and Ceuta enclaves remains problematic to us.

<<5391.01;5410.89;en>>
As the learned members of this court have stated, the purpose of Article 4 of Protocol 4 is to prevent states being able to remove certain aliens without examining their personal circumstances and consequently without enabling them to put forward their arguments against the measure.

<<5410.89;5429.61;en>>
In Hersey and others and Italy, the court found that the pushback of the applicants by the Italian authorities to Libya were carried out without any form of examination of each applicant's individual situation and that the Italian authorities did not carry out any identification procedures.

<<5429.61;5440.93;en>>
Moreover, the court noted that the personnel aboard the military ships were not trained to conduct individual interviews and were not assisted by interpreters or legal advisors.

<<5440.93;5462.31;en>>
The court has gone on to find that collective expulsion is to be understood as any measure compelling aliens as a group to leave a country except where such a measure is taken on the basis of a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual alien of the group.

<<5462.31;5478.61;en>>
The prohibition of collective expulsion therefore involves the existence of sufficient guarantees ensuring that the individual circumstances of each of those concerned are actually the subject of a detailed examination.

<<5478.61;5502.11;en>>
While these guarantees may vary depending on the circumstances of the case, in its Califia judgment the court noted in particular the registration of the identity and the nationality of the individuals as an important indicator of the existence of an identification procedure in determining compliance with Article 4, Protocol 4.

<<5502.11;5518.21;en>>
In this connection, the court recalled that each alien should have a genuine and effective possibility of submitting arguments against his or her expulsion and to have those arguments examined in an appropriate manner by the authorities of the respondent state.

<<5518.21;5529.49;en>>
The court further underlined that in an expulsion procedure, the possibility of lodging an asylum application is a paramount safeguard.

<<5529.49;5547.37;en>>
In UNHCR's view, the procedural guarantees protecting the persons concerned against collective expulsion are therefore essential also to prevent possible violations of the non-refoulement obligation under the 1951 Convention.

<<5547.37;5579.61;en>>
Indeed the prohibition of refoulement is engaged whenever there is conduct, for instance during border checks, pushbacks or forced removals, exposing an individual to a risk of being subject to persecution or ill-treatment in another country if the person has expressed a fear of such or the individual circumstances or characteristics of the applicant or group indicates a risk of refoulement of which the state ought to be aware.

<<5579.61;5591.97;en>>
The procedural guarantees ensuring compliance with Article 4, Protocol 4 contribute to the respect of the non-refoulement obligation under international refugee law.

<<5591.97;5613.01;en>>
Indeed, without a genuine and effective possibility for persons concerned to submit arguments against their expulsion and of having those arguments examined in an appropriate manner by adequately trained authorities, their potential need for international protection would not necessarily be identified.

<<5613.01;5620.21;en>>
In conclusion, Mr. President, distinguished judges, UNHCR considers that Spain's practice

<<5620.21;5646.19;en>>
of rejection at the border in this context and pushing back persons who may be in need of international protection without a proper identification procedure and without taking into account the circumstances, rights and needs of each individual is at variance with the prohibition of collective expulsion and may lead to a violation of non-refoulement.

<<5646.19;5647.61;en>>
I thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5648.72;5651.4;en>>
Thank you very much Mrs. O’hara.

<<5652.04;5658.12;en>>
And I thank the parties and the third party intervenors for their submissions before the court.

<<5658.6;5666.44;en>>
Now I invite my colleagues, the members of the Grand Chamber, who wish to do so, to put their questions to the parties.

<<5666.44;5668.44;en>>
So Judge Kucsko-Stadlmayer, please.

[[Judge;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer]]

<<5670.9;5674.4;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<5674.4;5680.48;en>>
My first questions go to the representatives of the applicants.

<<5680.48;5698.12;en>>
Mr. Gericke, you read out a statement of the first applicant, Mr. Nd, and my question is are you still in contact with both applicants, and do both of them tell you that they want to pursue their applications?

<<5698.12;5704.32;en>>
The second question concerns the events of 13 August 2014.

<<5704.32;5718.24;en>>
You say that the applicants were not given the slightest possibility to raise any arguments against their expulsion, but you also say that the legal issue of this case is not asylum.

<<5718.24;5724.76;en>>
What would have been the applicants' arguments against their removal?

<<5724.76;5736.64;en>>
Now my next questions go to the government, and the first question concerns Article 38 of the Asylum Law of 2009.

<<5736.64;5738.08;en>>
It was mentioned today.

<<5738.08;5747.28;en>>
It grants the ambassador of Spain the competence to allow people who are in need of international protection their transfer to Spain.

<<5747.28;5761.4;en>>
Now AIDA, the Asylum Information Database, writes that this provision lacked implementation, and this was repeated by the representative of the UNHCR.

<<5761.4;5778.08;en>>
But did I understand you correctly today when you mentioned the Royal Decree of 1995, that this decree was still in force and is still in force even after the adoption of this law?

<<5778.08;5782.12;en>>
I would be interested in an answer to this.

<<5782.12;5806.2;en>>
And finally, as to the Benin-Ansar border post, it has been said several times even today that there were difficulties for sub-Saharan asylum seekers, sub-Saharan people, to reach this post, not only before 1 September 2014, but even afterwards.

<<5806.2;5815.76;en>>
Do you have an explanation for this, and do you have any evidence for these alleged facts?

<<5815.76;5824.88;en>>
And finally, may I add also a question to the representative of the UNHCR, Mrs. O’hara.

<<5824.88;5844.92;en>>
You mentioned today and also in your written statement that until November 2014 there was, I quote, no mechanism in place for persons seeking international protection at the Benin-Ansar border post or anywhere else at the Spanish border.

<<5844.92;5861.12;en>>
But the Spanish government states and has submitted to us evidence that the building of the Special International Protection Unit at this border crossing only facilitated the lodging of asylum claims.

<<5861.12;5872.72;en>>
And they have submitted concrete figures which shows that there have been asylum claims even before 1 September 2014.

<<5872.72;5876.96;en>>
Now how do you comment on these concrete figures?

<<5876.96;5876.96;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5878.27;5879.47;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<5879.47;5880.43;en>>
Judge Bošnjak, please.

[[Judge;Marko Bošnjak]]

<<5882.74;5884.86;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<5884.86;5897.3;en>>
I would have two questions, both addressed to the representatives of the applicants, but of course the other participants are invited to comment if they so wish.

<<5897.3;5904.98;en>>
My first question is very similar to the second question that was addressed by my colleague Judge Kucsko-Stadlmayer.

<<5904.98;5920.18;en>>
Namely, I heard one of the representatives of the applicants saying that, I quote, this case is about the right to raise arguments before expulsion or against expulsion.

<<5920.18;5927.06;en>>
And it was underlined that this would be any legal argument, not only an asylum claim.

<<5927.06;5950.54;en>>
Now I wonder what would, what were actually the intentions of the applicants, what would be the arguments that they wanted to raise in the particular situation, but they were prevented to do so because they were removed from the territory of Spain at this particular occasion.

<<5950.54;5959.5;en>>
My second question refers to the arguments that were raised actually by the Spanish government.

<<5959.5;5976.06;en>>
The Spanish government, they say that the applicants lack victim status because they haven't proved that they actually participated in the events of the 13th of August, 2014.

<<5976.06;5996.94;en>>
The government say that no photographs were submitted by the applicants in the present situation, that no alternative expert report was submitted by the applicants or their representatives, and that the account of events as submitted by the applicants is not credible.

<<5996.94;6011.34;en>>
They refer to the injuries, broken leg of ND, and also injuries that supposedly the second applicant has suffered during the events in question.

<<6011.34;6022.1;en>>
Now I wonder what is your reply, I turn here to the applicants, what is your exactly reply to those assertions by the government?

<<6022.1;6023.16;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<6023.51;6025.51;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<6025.51;6026.63;en>>
Judge Pejchal, please.

[[Judge;Aleš Pejchal]]

<<6028.66;6030.66;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<6030.66;6037.64;en>>
I have the same question for both parties, for government and representative of applicants.

<<6038.68;6046.24;en>>
Can you establish where both applicants, and D and T are now, and how long time?

<<6049.4;6058.56;en>>
And if you can, can you offer us some relevant, serious proof, evidence about it?

<<6058.56;6059.72;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<6060.87;6064.63;en>>
Thank you very much. Now, Judge Elósegui, please.

[[Judge;María Elósegui]]

<<6067.81;6069.61;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<6069.61;6077.51;en>>
I have some questions related to facts for both parties.

<<6077.51;6097.53;en>>
First, for the representative of the applicants, concerning Indy, what is the exact year when he left Mali, going to Mauritania, 2011 or 2012?

<<6097.53;6118.65;en>>
And also, why did he never try to ask asylum in any of the consulates or embassies between 2011 and 2014 before his first jumping into the fence?

<<6118.65;6147.53;en>>
And also, I'm interested in which was the reasons later on when he was already in Spain in a second jump that he asked asylum, and he was denied twice for the Office of the United Nations for High Commission for Refugees, which one were the reasons, legal reasons?

<<6147.53;6162.09;en>>
And in relation with Indy, in the facts, the applicant said that he escaped from Ivory Coast in 2012 because he was at risk.

<<6162.09;6164.73;en>>
Was there a conflict?

<<6164.73;6186.25;en>>
Then later on, when he has arrived to Melilla in the second jump and to Spain in the mainland in October 2014, why has he never asked asylum in Spain?

<<6189.51;6204.35;en>>
Well, and in both cases, why did he never try to enter Spain for the official entrances or without visa of work?

<<6204.35;6236.41;en>>
Well, my last question for the representative of the applicants, did they present in some moment in all this process, in the administrative process in Spain, some official documents of identity, like passport, identity cards, records of births, or anything to demonstrate who they were or their country of origin?

<<6239.61;6244.11;en>>
And now my questions for the government.

<<6244.11;6264.09;en>>
According to the government, the identification of the persons asking asylum must be conducted at the official border crossing or in the Spanish embassies and consulates, we have heard, and it is in the report.

<<6264.09;6273.81;en>>
Then could you explain, given the facts of the real possibilities for a real refugee to access to these means?

<<6273.81;6297.25;en>>
And very concrete, in the exposition, you have said that after, in September 2014, was created the Bureau of Venezuela and Saar, but before it was also possible to ask for asylum.

<<6297.25;6306.61;en>>
Could you give us some data, these persons' numbers, that they were brought when they jumped and they are the success?

<<6306.61;6315.81;en>>
They are brought to the police station, because I suppose that there are also numbers.

<<6315.81;6330.65;en>>
And also, I will thank some data about the numbers of persons who tried to jump the Melilla fence.

<<6330.65;6337.61;en>>
And especially, it's interesting, if they have some features in common.

<<6337.61;6341.61;en>>
I want to say, are they from the same country?

<<6341.61;6353.25;en>>
They are a collective, or they are some characteristic, like they have the same race or ethnicity, or they come from the same countries in war?

<<6353.25;6355.73;en>>
What is your data?

<<6355.73;6355.73;en>>
And well, thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<6358.86;6360.43;en>>
Thank you very much. Judge Karakaş please.

[[Judge;Işıl Karakaş]]

<<6364.34;6366.3;fr>>
Merci beaucoup, M. le Président.

<<6366.5;6371.54;fr>>
Ma première question, c'est pour le gouvernement, plutôt.

<<6371.74;6398.86;fr>>
Je me demande si la 10e disposition additionnelle insérée par la loi organique du 4 mars 2015, qui instaure un régime spécial pour Ceuta et Mérida, et qui prévoit aussi la possibilité de refoulement, je dirais que, est-ce que cette disposition a été appliquée conformément aux droits internationaux et aussi à la jurisprudence de Strasbourg?

<<6400.78;6408.06;fr>>
Et ma deuxième question concerne plutôt les deux parties, aussi les tiers intervenants, s'ils le veulent, bien sûr.

<<6408.9;6424.34;fr>>
Donc, c'est intéressant dans le dossier que d'après les ONG et les tiers intervenants, le poste frontière de Béné Enzar n'est pas accessible aux migrants sapsaériens se trouvant aux côtés marocains.

<<6424.54;6431.94;fr>>
Donc, est-ce que vous connaissez les raisons de cette affirmation ou de cette pratique, je dirais?

<<6432.14;6436.14;fr>>
Et quelle est la situation aujourd'hui au poste Béné Enzar?

<<6436.14;6436.14;fr>>
Merci beaucoup.

<<6446.73;6448.33;en>>
No, you are first.

<<6448.33;6450.01;en>>
I'm getting...

Judge Nußberger, please.

[[Judge;Angelika Nußberger]]

<<6453.53;6457.06;en>>
Thank you very much. I would just have one question to the applicants.

<<6457.06;6464.41;en>>
I understand that you do not claim that Spain did not have a right to build a fence at the border.

<<6465.77;6470.98;en>>
The fence that was built was, as I understand, meant to be unsurmountable.

<<6471.61;6476.73;en>>
Obviously, it was unsurmountable for women, for children, for old people.

<<6476.73;6482.34;en>>
There were only young men able to climb over the fence, and that's the starting point of your complaint.

<<6482.34;6495.06;en>>
So my question is, in your view, under international law, would it be possible or allowed for Spain to build now a really unsurmountable fence, even not surmountable by young men?

<<6495.06;6495.06;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<6496.73;6500.19;en>>

[[Judge;Armen Harutyunyan]]

<<6503.51;6505.09;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<6505.85;6510.01;en>>
First, my question is for representative of UNHCR.

<<6510.01;6514.17;en>>
So you have many representatives and offices in Africa.

<<6514.77;6529.09;en>>
Have you ever came across information or fact that there are really organized groups which are taking money and directing people to cross the border of European or given country?

<<6530.27;6531.51;en>>
This is a first question.

<<6531.51;6541.33;en>>
And the second question for representatives of government, but of course, applicants are representatives if they would like, if they wish, they can comment that as well.

<<6541.33;6546.75;en>>
Do you, whether there was a violation during the crossing the border?

<<6546.75;6552.63;en>>
And if yes, do you have any data or number of guardians civil who suffered for that?

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<6557.86;6559.58;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<6559.58;6560.78;en>>
M. le juge Sicilianos

[[Judge;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<6564.43;6565.63;fr>>
Merci, M. le Président.

<<6565.83;6571.43;fr>>
Je voudrais, moi aussi, poser une question principalement à la représentante du DHR.

<<6572.31;6576.71;fr>>
Mais bien sûr, si les partis voudraient commenter, ce serait bien.

<<6577.83;6590.71;fr>>
Vous êtes au courant, madame, que dans l'affaire Claifia contre l'Italie, la Grande chambre s'est référée au projet d'article de la Commission du droit international des Nations unies sur l'expulsion des étrangers.

<<6590.71;6597.47;fr>>
Et que dans l'article 2 de ce projet, il y a une définition de la notion d'expulsion.

<<6598.63;6613.07;fr>>
Et dans cette définition, la Commission du droit international exclut l'extradition, ça, c'est clair, mais elle exclut également la non-admission, terme qu'elle préfère à la notion de refoulement.

<<6614.07;6624.23;fr>>
Donc la non-admission est exclue du champ d'application des articles de la CDI sur l'expulsion des étrangers.

<<6625.27;6645.27;fr>>
Et puis après, dans la disposition qui concerne l'expulsion collective, la Commission du droit international se réfère à la définition de la notion générique d'expulsion, ce qui signifie que, d'après la lecture de ce projet, de la notion d'expulsion collective est exclue la non-admission d'étrangers.

<<6647.43;6664.55;fr>>
En même temps, on voit que dans le commentaire de la définition, il est dit que cette portée restrictive de la notion d'expulsion est sans préjudice, je cite, des règles du droit international relatives aux réfugiés.

<<6666.23;6668.67;fr>>
Et ma question est la suivante.

<<6668.87;6684.39;fr>>
Comment est-ce que vous voyez l'articulation entre la définition restrictive de la notion d'expulsion qui exclut la non-admission d'une part et le droit des réfugiés, notamment le principe de non-réfoulement d'autre part?

<<6684.83;6686.75;fr>>
Articulation entre les deux.

<<6686.75;6686.75;fr>>
Merci beaucoup.

M. le juge Potocki.

[[Judge;André Potocki]]

<<6696.08;6697.32;fr>>
Merci, Monsieur le Président.

<<6698.64;6716.2;fr>>
Manifestement, au cœur de nos débats se trouve la relation entre le droit à demander l'asile et l'interdiction posée par l'article 4 du protocole 4 des expulsions collectives.

<<6716.2;6736.12;fr>>
Mais cette discussion de principe est parfois un peu obscurcie par des circonstances particulières de l'affaire et notamment les discussions sur le point de savoir s'il existait ou non des possibilités effectives de demander l'asile dans ces enclaves.

<<6736.12;6745.76;fr>>
Donc permettez-moi de formuler cette fois-ci la question de façon assez abstraite pour que les positions soient bien claires aux yeux de la Cour.

<<6745.76;6774.48;fr>>
Est-ce que les parties et les parties intervenantes considèrent que dans des conditions où il serait établi que toute personne considérant qu'elle est menacée de traitement contraire à la Convention peut demander l'asile, des personnes qui n'auraient pas eu recours à cette possibilité effective pourraient néanmoins invoquer l'article 4 du protocole 4?

<<6774.48;6783.2;fr>>
C'est donc la question de principe et non pas les modalités précises dans cette affaire sur laquelle je voudrais avoir votre position.

<<6783.2;6783.2;fr>>
Merci beaucoup.

Please be seated. The hearing is resumed. And I call Mr. Gericke.Please you have the floor.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<7285.87;7288.87;en>>
Mr. President, honorable members of the court,

<<7288.87;7295.87;en>>
I will start by answering the question of Judge Kuskosch-Stadelmeier.

<<7295.87;7303.15;en>>
The first question was whether we are still in contact with both of my clients.

<<7303.15;7306.93;en>>
And I, of course, can confirm that.

<<7306.93;7315.67;en>>
I explained in paragraph 20 in our submissions the ways how we communicated with both applicants.

<<7315.67;7327.91;en>>
Both applicants were informed of every single step in this procedure, including the referral decision by this court and about the hearing that takes place today.

<<7327.91;7334.59;en>>
And as you refer to my specific quote of my client, Mr. N.D.,

<<7334.59;7336.59;en>>
he asked me to say this to you.

<<7336.59;7346.19;en>>
And I felt obliged to share his views with the court.

<<7346.19;7348.91;en>>
This question was also raised already.

<<7348.91;7357.99;en>>
The question of maintenance of contact was also raised before this hearing and by the Spanish government.

<<7357.99;7376.43;en>>
And I further explained the situation in a letter to the court on this very aspect and also pointed out the issues of confidentiality and the lawyer-client privilege in that context.

<<7376.43;7386.19;en>>
But I can confirm, and it is quite clear, that we are in contact with both applicants.

<<7386.19;7401.55;en>>
The second question was about the question concerned what, in particular, Mr. N.T., but in fact both applicants,

<<7401.55;7411.11;en>>
would have said had they had the possibility to raise arguments before their expulsion back to Morocco on the 13th of August.

<<7411.11;7422.55;en>>
And this is also, I already mentioned this in my presentation, but maybe one point needs to be clarified.

<<7422.55;7442.91;en>>
When we said that this possibility is not about this case, it's not about an asylum, this referred to the Spanish submissions that always point to the later asylum claim and the asylum procedure that took place in Spain after the second entry.

<<7442.91;7470.99;en>>
What we also submitted earlier today is that the case is, insofar, not only about asylum or not limited on asylum claim, maybe this is the better phrasing, but also about the possibility to raise other kind of claims against an expulsion and, of course, in particular, Article 3 of the Convention, but even not limited to that.

<<7470.99;7489.31;en>>
So we submit that in the present case, had the applicants the opportunity to raise arguments before the expulsion to Morocco, and D, of course, first would have expressed his claim that he wishes to claim asylum in this situation, and as he did later.

<<7489.31;7501.55;en>>
And for both applicants, of course, they would have raised claims as to their fear of ill treatment in Morocco in the hands of the Moroccan authorities.

<<7501.55;7512.75;en>>
And as I explained in the beginning of my presentation, of my speech, they both face violence, disproportionate violence on that day.

<<7512.75;7515.13;en>>
They saw how their friends were being up.

<<7515.13;7519.91;en>>
They visited how other climbers were violated and beaten.

<<7519.91;7528.39;en>>
And both of them also would have referred to the more general situation in Morocco, because it is quite clear.

<<7528.39;7543.27;en>>
And also, we submitted a lot of evidence on that point that there are systematic issues of violence against, in particular, sub-Saharan refugees and migrants in Morocco.

<<7543.27;7547.51;en>>
The UN raised this point, for example.

<<7547.51;7560.63;en>>
And these would also have been their claims that in the course of their deportation and afterwards, they had faced ill treatment.

<<7560.63;7576.27;en>>
And finally, this is all confirmed, this experience that they made, these regular raids, for example, they faced during their stay in Morocco, them being targeted by state authorities.

<<7576.27;7583.75;en>>
All of this is not only their single experience, but it is raised in many reports.

<<7583.75;7596.83;en>>
I refer you to the Human Rights Report that we annexed as Annex 29, Medicin Sans Frontieres, Trapped at the Gates of Europe, Annex 14, GADEM, Annex 20.

<<7596.83;7609.17;en>>
And in particular, we addressed this very issue also in our submissions on paragraph 4 and 246.

<<7609.17;7614.47;en>>
So this was, I think, the question you raised.

<<7614.47;7620.35;en>>
The next question we were asked was about Judge Bosniak.

<<7620.35;7623.87;en>>
And the question was, I think, quite similar.

<<7623.87;7629.19;en>>
So the issues, what they have raised, I think I already responded to.

<<7629.19;7635.51;en>>
The second part of your question concerned the evidence submitted in this case.

<<7635.51;7655.47;en>>
And insofar for what concerns the pictures, we submitted pictures in particular for this hearing that allow for a visual impression of the material we submitted to the court.

<<7655.47;7669.83;en>>
But as we explained in our second submission to the chamber, we submitted these pictures, most and foremost, because the applicants identified themselves on these pictures.

<<7669.83;7676.55;en>>
They saw these pictures, they saw these videos, they identified themselves in that evidence.

<<7676.55;7682.91;en>>
And this is why we felt obliged to also share this evidence with the court.

<<7682.91;7690.51;en>>
As for the credibility of their accounts, we also heard Spain's submissions on that point.

<<7690.51;7692.39;en>>
This is all.

<<7692.39;7713.39;en>>
We already addressed this point in our submissions at paragraph 26 to 28, where we expressly explained why it is simply not true that the accounts of the applicants are not accurate.

<<7713.39;7725.63;en>>
We said Spain compared the wrong persons and made distortions and misquotes of their account in order to kind of change their reputation.

<<7725.63;7739.87;en>>
The next question we were asked by Judge Paykal was about the question where the two applicants are staying now.

<<7739.87;7745.31;en>>
And we also addressed this in our written submissions.

<<7745.31;7751.59;en>>
Mr. Nd still lives in Mali at the border to Senegal.

<<7751.59;7756.15;en>>
And Mr. Nt still lives in Spain, in the south of Spain,

<<7756.15;7757.15;en>>
in Andalusia.

<<7770.27;7774.75;en>>
The next set of questions we were asked by Judge Ilozogui.

<<7777.31;7787.07;en>>
The first question was about the question of when exactly Mr. Nd left Mali.

<<7787.07;7797.87;en>>
And we pointed this out in our written submissions that we were instructed that he left Mali at the end of 2011 or the beginning of 2012.

<<7797.87;7803.11;en>>
This is what he said on this point.

<<7803.11;7811.19;en>>
The next question was why he never tried to apply for asylum, both at Spanish embassies or consulates.

<<7811.19;7816.71;en>>
And I think this question was already answered by my colleague, Mr. Bouguier,

<<7816.71;7827.19;en>>
that this possibility simply does not exist because the respective legislation is missing.

<<7827.19;7836.87;en>>
And for the first time, we heard today about the alternative possibility for an ambassador to allow for a visa.

<<7836.87;7840.95;en>>
But this is only a theoretical possibility.

<<7840.95;7854.59;en>>
And Spain, for good reasons, did not submit any evidence as to the practicality, as to the effectiveness of this possibility.

<<7854.59;7862.11;en>>
The question was also raised whether or why they haven't or he hasn't applied for asylum.

<<7862.11;7864.43;en>>
For example, in Morocco.

<<7864.43;7890.47;en>>
And this question was also, and so far, I also would like to draw your attention to paragraph 2 and 4, 2 to 4 of our submissions, where we explicitly referred also to a fact sheet from UNHCR on the situation in Morocco because this possibility did not exist in 2012 until 2014.

<<7890.47;7893.19;en>>
Even UNHCR holded their services.

<<7893.19;7908.15;en>>
And therefore, I also have to say that the Spanish government misquoted our submissions as to this point in the hearing today.

<<7908.15;7923.11;en>>
The next question we were asked was why Mr. Endi's asylum

<<7923.11;7925.55;en>>
application was dismissed.

<<7925.55;7933.23;en>>
And you find the answer to this also in the annexes that the Spanish government submitted to the court.

<<7933.23;7947.63;en>>
And the reason was that the Spanish authorities found in 2015 that he does not fulfill the definition of the refugee convention.

<<7947.63;7950.71;en>>
It does not apply for him.

<<7950.71;7957.59;en>>
As to Mr. Endi, we said that he left Cote d'Ivoire

<<7957.59;7962.99;en>>
in a post-conflict situation of high instability.

<<7962.99;7967.83;en>>
He also managed to re-enter Spain.

<<7967.83;7972.95;en>>
And I explained that he's now living in the south of Spain.

<<7972.95;7973.87;en>>
He did not apply.

<<7973.87;7974.55;en>>
This is correct.

<<7974.55;7983.11;en>>
He did not apply for asylum other than Mr. Endi.

<<7983.11;8019.19;en>>
After his transfer to the Spanish mainland, he was advised by lawyers in Spain about this possibility, but also about the possibility to apply for a residence permit under the so-called arrego social, which is a mechanism in Spain that is explicitly foreseen for persons in his situation and allows to legalize a status by work, in particular by working in the agriculture sector in Andalusia.

<<8019.19;8033.99;en>>
And since he does not have to fear the deportation back to Morocco, he lived in a relatively safe environment.

<<8033.99;8038.71;en>>
This is the answer to that question.

<<8038.71;8042.19;en>>
We were also asked about documents.

<<8042.19;8044.55;en>>
We submit ID documents.

<<8044.55;8054.51;en>>
And I can also, in so far, refer you to the case file, because we submitted the city cards for both applicants.

<<8054.51;8068.67;en>>
And in fact, until now, nobody has ever claimed that the applicants do not exist or that their account does not match with this case.

<<8068.67;8071.59;en>>
And I only refer you, for example, for Mr. Endi

<<8071.59;8081.55;en>>
to the video interview that I also mentioned earlier today, that he gave two days to a member of the Spanish Parliament, by the way.

<<8081.55;8084.79;en>>
This is the next question.

<<8088.47;8094.99;en>>
We were asked by Judge Karakash about the situation at the border now.

<<8094.99;8112.27;en>>
As far as we are aware, the problem of racial profiling on the Moroccan border still exists, and many sources at the moment say that the situation has become much worse, in particular in the last couple of months.

<<8112.27;8120.55;en>>
But it is still the fact that sub-Saharan refugees and migrants have no possibility at all to reach the Benin-Za border post.

<<8124.11;8133.27;en>>
Then we were asked, sorry that I know that I already spoke 10 minutes, but there are some further questions.

<<8133.27;8136.63;en>>
The next question we were asked was by...

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<8134.72;8135.72;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<8135.72;8141.96;en>>
Yes, in fact we are already at 14 minutes, but I understand there were quite a number of questions.

<<8141.84;8143.24;en>>
So please go ahead.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<8141.96;8141.96;en>>
Thank you.

<<8143.24;8146.72;en>>
I try to be as fast as possible.

<<8146.72;8162.08;en>>
The next question we were asked was by Judge Nussberger about how we see what is our position as to defense in relation to international law.

<<8162.08;8170.48;en>>
And of course, I will only answer this question in relation to Article 4 of the Protocol and the jurisdictional issues.

<<8170.48;8188.52;en>>
And our position on this is that the fence itself and the question whether a fence is built that cannot be climbed or trespassed, this is not a problem, or this is not an issue of Article 4 of Protocol.

<<8188.52;8207.0;en>>
What we say is that jurisdiction applies, the convention applies, and then the main legal issue in that respect is whether persons, individuals who climb the fence are actively driven away.

<<8207.0;8214.4;en>>
I think this is the wording of the court when it comes to the definition of what qualifies for an expulsion.

<<8214.4;8222.44;en>>
So if a person climbs the fence, this is, of course, not an expulsion in the meaning of Article 4 of Protocol.

<<8222.44;8248.44;en>>
But when, like in our case and in the present case, when my clients were grabbed, were handcuffed, were forced to leave the country, when Spanish authorities opened the doors and hand them over into the violent situation in Morocco, into the hands of Moroccan officers, I think this is driven away in the sense of Article 4 of Protocol, no matter how high the fence is they climbed.

<<8248.44;8263.44;en>>
The next question, then, the final question was maybe also more in a more general way asked by Judge Potocki.

<<8263.44;8285.76;en>>
And if I understand it correctly, the question was, what is the relevance of access of Article 4 of Protocol in the context of the scenario where an asylum claim could be made?

<<8285.76;8308.2;en>>
And what we explained and what we said in our presentation and our speech earlier today is that, and maybe this also refers to the answer to the first question, the prohibition of collective expulsion should prevent or should allow for the possibility to make an asylum claim.

<<8308.2;8313.2;en>>
And so far, this is fixed.

<<8313.2;8324.52;en>>
But it also allows for other claims to be made, even for persons who don't have an asylum claim, who are not legible under the 51 Convention.

<<8324.52;8330.76;en>>
And for example, maybe the most striking example are minors.

<<8330.76;8340.48;en>>
We see we have minors at the border in Melilla, 12-year-old, 13-year-old, who also climbed the fences and who are also on Spanish territory.

<<8340.48;8348.4;en>>
And maybe they would not have an asylum claim in this narrower sense of the 51 Convention.

<<8348.4;8353.08;en>>
But of course, they have claims, for example, under the Child Right Convention.

<<8353.08;8361.08;en>>
And there is a case pending, in particular, on this very matter of a minor who was in Spain and who was treated in the same way.

<<8361.08;8368.2;en>>
And he could have raised, of course, his rights under the CRC.

<<8368.2;8371.76;en>>
And the same goes for traffic victims.

<<8371.76;8384.52;en>>
And of course, and this is also what I said earlier for claims under Article 3 in relation not to asylum in the country of origin, but also to the situation in the country of destination.

<<8384.52;8391.76;en>>
And this is what this case mainly is about when it comes to Mr. Antti,

<<8391.76;8395.76;en>>
because he had this fear of violence by the Moroccan authorities.

<<8395.76;8403.84;en>>
And he would have raised the situation he faced in Morocco.

<<8403.84;8417.52;en>>
So to conclude, to briefly conclude, and let me just say one short, if I may, one short remark.

<<8417.52;8425.16;en>>
I have not the time now to say more about the government's submissions today.

<<8425.16;8432.4;en>>
And the question of jurisdiction was, for good reason, not raised publicly in this hearing by the Spanish government.

<<8432.4;8454.38;en>>
But I think we have to be clear that what the Spanish government is asking this court for is to allow for an unlawful policy by accepting the existence of lawless zones on its territory at the border, of zones where all rights, even rights under the Child Right Convention under Article 3, are denied and not accessible.

<<8454.38;8462.84;en>>
And such a concept, I think we can all agree on that, is completely adverse to the purpose of the convention.

<<8462.84;8487.08;en>>
And I think we have had this impressive third-party interventions as to the importance of Article 4, Fourth Protocol, in order to allow claims to be assessed, to allow for a procedure, to allow for an identification, at least in order to be able to explain the situation and to raise arguments against an expulsion.

<<8487.08;8508.16;en>>
And by accepting the policy of summary and automatic expulsions, as we have it in the border, in the operational border protocol, which is also not mentioned for good reason by Spain, if we accept this, then we also accept arbitrariness at the border in general and also thus a refoulement.

<<8508.16;8518.4;en>>
Because all these rights, all the non-refoulement rights, are built on the possibility to be claimed and to be enforced before an expulsion.

<<8518.4;8524.2;en>>
But for these claims to materialize within a national framework, a gateway is needed.

<<8524.2;8529.52;en>>
And this gateway exactly is Article 4, Fourth Protocol.

<<8529.52;8529.52;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<8530.54;8533.54;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Gericke.

<<8533.54;8536.54;en>>
I call Mr. Leon Cavero.

<<8536.54;8536.54;en>>
Please, you have the floor.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<8539.38;8540.86;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<8540.86;8546.62;en>>
With the leave of this honorable court, I would like to answer briefly to the questions posed.

<<8546.62;8551.62;en>>
First of all, we will answer the questions of Judge Jigakse Estatmaya.

<<8551.62;8561.58;en>>
First of all, we must say that Article 38 of the law of 2009 calls for a future relation to be delivered.

<<8561.58;8579.26;en>>
But according to Article 22 of our civil code, which regulates the applications of rules in our country, any regulation is still in force, even when the law changes, provided that the regulation is not in opposition to what the new law says.

<<8579.26;8591.06;en>>
And in this time, the new law doesn't establish anything which is opposed to the articles of the regulation I furnished in its translation into English.

<<8591.06;8612.1;en>>
And in fact, it is shown by the circular, which was sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the embassies and consulates, which establishes how the ambassadors have to deal with the coexistence of both rules at the same time, although the law is of higher rank than the regulation, as it can be understood.

<<8612.1;8636.42;en>>
So that it says that it is the ambassador who has the competency, not the consul, and that the ambassador has to follow a specific proceeding when the claim for asylum is posed in embassies and consulates so that he has to ascertain the seriousness of the claim, first of all, making by his own the investigation and submitting to the superiority, it is said in the circular, which is in the regulation.

<<8636.42;8649.02;en>>
It is the interministerial commission for asylum and refuge who will examine the file and will deliver a decision which should be subject to judicial review in six months' time.

<<8649.02;8662.8;en>>
And we have also provided statistics that show that effectively persons come to embassies and consulates and request for this kind of regulation to be applied.

<<8662.8;8674.06;en>>
Secondly, regarding the presumed difficulties of Sub-Saharans to accede to Beni and Saar offices.

<<8674.06;8678.54;en>>
First of all, Mr. Boyer has said it today.

<<8678.54;8689.06;en>>
The CR has said it today, and we have heard attentively what the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Commissioner of the Council of Europe has said about this.

<<8689.06;8699.08;en>>
And they say that it is in the Moroccan territory that it may happen that someone prevents Sub-Saharan from approaching.

<<8699.08;8709.18;en>>
So Spain is not to blame for things that happen in the Moroccan territory over which we do not have any control, first of all.

<<8709.18;8716.74;en>>
Secondly, there is a clear explanation of why Sub-Saharans do not request asylum.

<<8716.74;8726.46;en>>
And it is plainly that this migration is, except of some cases, economic migration.

<<8726.46;8730.7;en>>
And so they don't have normally legal grounds to request asylum.

<<8730.7;8741.86;en>>
And that is why the Syrians or people from other nationalities whose countries are under siege and who are in a situation of need, they claim asylum.

<<8741.86;8753.86;en>>
And that is what is reflected in detailed statistics that we have furnished with our written pleadings before the Grand Chamber and in the relevant annexes there too.

<<8758.26;8784.42;en>>
On top of that, we would like to say that in the video footage, which is the only evidence we have of the real facts that happened, there is not a single evidence of ill treatment from the part of the Spanish forces or from the part of the Moroccan forces, as that is the only direct evidence we have.

<<8784.42;8792.9;en>>
And that is why the Chamber decided to admit that part of the claim for being ill-founded.

<<8792.9;8803.66;en>>
The second questions to be answered are the questions of Judge Payal.

<<8803.66;8808.24;en>>
Just say if we can establish where the applicants are now.

<<8808.24;8815.32;en>>
Well, first of all, Mr. Nt, who requested asylum,

<<8815.32;8829.68;en>>
his lawyer decided not to maintain its judicial review of the denial of asylum, which was backed by two reports of the United Nations High Commissioner of the Refugees.

<<8829.68;8836.2;en>>
So its counsel was informed and he returned to his home country.

<<8836.2;8840.8;en>>
It hasn't been reported that he has suffered any damage so far.

<<8840.8;8846.9;en>>
And in fact, the applicants have not said anything about that.

<<8846.9;8859.24;en>>
Secondly, regarding Mr. Nt, Mr. Mboye was and is his lawyer

<<8859.24;8861.92;en>>
since December 2014.

<<8861.92;8867.84;en>>
And we have just learned from Mr. Karike that the lawyer has

<<8867.84;8875.48;en>>
advised him not to seek asylum.

<<8875.48;8879.84;en>>
And in fact, it is Mr. Mboye who has left the decision

<<8879.84;8884.44;en>>
on expulsion be final, not posing a judicial review.

<<8884.44;8894.86;en>>
And it seems to be that he has preferred to advise his client to flee and remain at large until now.

<<8894.86;8903.0;en>>
Regarding the question posed by Mrs. Elosegi, Judge Elosegi,

<<8903.0;8922.78;en>>
regarding the persons, subsaharans, who had acceded the Benin-Sar border crossing before 13th August 2014, the data regarding this.

<<8922.78;8936.08;en>>
Well, in our written submission before the grand chamber, we have explained how Spanish legislation always has established that asylum could be requested at border crossings.

<<8936.08;8969.28;en>>
But before we built in 1st September and we put into function in 1st September 2014 a specific office for international protection in the border crossing of Benin-Sar, what the police did when someone came to the border crossing and asked for asylum is that they were accompanied to the religious police station and there was an internal proceeding on that entry which was completely followed.

<<8969.28;8976.52;en>>
An example of these proceedings is furnished by Spain to the court because the whole administrative files of Mr. NT

<<8976.52;8978.74;en>>
and Mr. ND have been furnished.

<<8978.74;8999.08;en>>
And we must remember precisely paragraph 16 of the applicant's submissions before the grand chamber where I quote, at no point of the current proceedings did the applicant's claim any violation to the convention in relation to these latter events and subsequent procedure.

<<8999.08;9008.94;en>>
So even the applicant's lawyer considered that internal proceedings are in compliance with the convention.

<<9008.94;9012.24;en>>
It is not true that they didn't have legal advisor.

<<9012.24;9015.4;en>>
Mr. Poyer was one of the legal advisors.

<<9015.4;9018.32;en>>
It is not true that they didn't have interpreter.

<<9018.32;9030.98;en>>
There was interpretation and there is a translation of transcription of what they said in both proceedings and judicial review could take place.

<<9030.98;9039.78;en>>
Regarding the following questions relating to Mrs. Selossie,

<<9039.78;9047.52;en>>
regarding data of persons trying to jump the fence and from which country they came from.

<<9047.52;9061.8;en>>
Well, the data of the people who were trying to jump unlawfully the fence in 2014 has been detailed in our written submission before the grand chamber.

<<9061.8;9075.94;en>>
At page 35, paragraph 64, we give a detailed account of the number of persons.

<<9075.94;9082.62;en>>
Of course, we don't know the nationality of those persons because we prevent entry.

<<9082.62;9088.02;en>>
We don't have a control of the nationality of those persons.

<<9088.02;9110.66;en>>
But we consider that there are people from different nationalities that gather together in order to make an unlawful, massive, and violent attacks to the border as it is shown in the video footage we have provided regarding the 13th August attack and attacks that took place later on.

<<9110.66;9122.26;en>>
So, the next question, excuse me, have been posed by Judge Caracas.

<<9122.26;9131.86;en>>
About the 10th additional rule of law 2015, establishing a special regime.

<<9131.86;9144.88;en>>
Well, this law was not applicable in August 2015, but this did not mean that there wasn't law applicable at the date of the facts.

<<9144.88;9164.86;en>>
In the date of the facts, it was applicable the Schengen border code whose articles 12 and 13 and recital 6 oblige all member states and precisely this is an European Union border and the Schengen border to prevent an authorized entry by any legal means.

<<9164.86;9177.1;en>>
And the internal regulation of security cops in charge of border control in Spain, which we have furnished with our observations before the chamber.

<<9177.1;9184.42;en>>
It is said that it is precisely the Guardia Civil who is in charge of this border control operation.

<<9184.42;9214.66;en>>
Of course, these operations have to be taken and driven with full respect of human rights and especially of Article 2 and Article 3, our constitution was made just at the same moment where we entered the Council of Europe and it has, it contains all the rights of the convention in the human rights part and it is an special body to interpret all laws according to Article 10.4

<<9214.66;9219.06;en>>
of the same constitution.

<<9219.06;9225.24;en>>
Regarding if Benin and Sahar is not accessible from Morocco, why?

<<9225.24;9227.24;en>>
What is the situation?

<<9227.24;9244.86;en>>
Well, we have already said it, all people in here, the CR, the United Nations, have said that there are, someone reports there is difficulty in Moroccan territory, but we are not to blame for that and we don't know if that is the case or not.

<<9244.86;9252.42;en>>
We only can find a logical explanation which is the lack of ground to request asylum.

<<9252.42;9274.74;en>>
Well, now we will go to the question posed by Judge Harutyun about are there mafias directing people to cross the border?

<<9274.74;9319.74;en>>
Well, it is not us who say that, we also say that and we have fairness proof, but it is Amnesty International in a report which was partially transcribed on paragraph 177 of our first submissions before the chamber that says, talks about the traffickers of human beings regarding migration and how they mistreat them and how they are fueled by enticing information they give them in their homeland about the possibilities of unlawfully enter precisely through malicious border.

<<9319.74;9332.98;en>>
But it is not only Amnesty International, but the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has recently made a global study on smuggling of migrants where you can see in detail how these mafias work.

<<9332.98;9347.3;en>>
So this is not Spain's invention unfortunately, but a real life situation which is quite despicable for all of us.

<<9347.3;9390.9;en>>
Concerning now the questions posed by Judge Sicilianos, well, we find that the answer to your very sensible question is that the international community has the global compact we have and it shows, says that where there is people that can pretend to seek refuge, he should have a legal venue to ask for it without paying a mafia.

<<9390.9;9396.96;en>>
That is the conclusion after an in-depth study on the matter.

<<9396.96;9414.58;en>>
And in fact, I have furnished you the data that people from Mali and people from Ivory Coast is coming to our embassies in their country requesting visas, not only transit visas, but also medium-term visas and long-term visas.

<<9414.58;9421.9;en>>
And once they are in lawfully in our country, they can request asylum if they so wish.

<<9421.9;9433.38;en>>
And in fact, the applicants in paragraph 16 of their submission have not had but to admit that these proceedings fully comply with the convention.

<<9433.38;9457.1;en>>
And that is the way, coming in a lawful way and requesting asylum in our territory without paying any mafia and without risking a dangerous travel to the Mediterranean or risking death in the Teneri Desert.

<<9457.1;9476.7;en>>
Now, we will go to the, also to the, sorry, I have forgotten one answer before, which was about the, which were the actual damage to civil guards in the border fence.

<<9476.7;9482.42;en>>
Well, we have furnished you data in our written submission because you asked about this.

<<9482.42;9495.66;en>>
And in 2004, 30 civil guards were hurt by bruises, cuts due to the use of knives, hooks, and sticks from the part of the migrants as in Annex 28 is shown.

<<9495.66;9500.9;en>>
And they have used fire to menace the agents as it is shown.

<<9500.9;9521.06;en>>
And for example, on 15 October 2014, a civil guard agent was made to be, to fall from three meters high and due to the aggression of one of the sub-Saharan who tried to entry.

<<9521.06;9528.7;en>>
He had very grave injuries and he had to stay in the hospital during several weeks.

<<9528.7;9546.78;en>>
But you have also and you will have in your eye this same August attack against the Felters Fence, which, of which several civil guards were injured and had to be taken care in hospital.

<<9546.78;9551.26;en>>
Well, coming back, sorry for having skipped that.

<<9551.26;9557.18;en>>
My colleague has advised me a lot and I thank him for it.

<<9557.18;9576.5;en>>
Now, we are going to the, I think the last question you posed regarding the question posed by Judge Potocki.

<<9576.5;9583.58;en>>
What happens if a person has not requested asylum?

<<9583.58;9588.36;en>>
Can he request the protection under Article 4 of Protocol 4?

<<9588.36;9614.74;en>>
Well, we think that you have already answered this in your case law, saying that if the exhaustion of available and effective possibility of alleging any legal cause for asylum is attributable to the culpable conduct of the person, then it is not possible to apply Article 4 of Protocol 4.

<<9614.74;9630.66;en>>
And in this sense, we have furnished you with evidence of not only one but three legal venues in which these people can come without risking harm and damage from the mafias.

<<9630.66;9647.14;en>>
So to conclude, we would like to say briefly that religious protection of the border is not a wall.

<<9647.14;9648.96;en>>
It's not a wall.

<<9648.96;9656.38;en>>
It is an integral system to orderly regulate migration.

<<9656.38;9667.74;en>>
It is formed by our net of embassies and consulates worldwide, by the fences, and by the authorized border crossings.

<<9667.74;9686.1;en>>
We have shown to you how it is possible by law and in practice to come through legal means to Spain and thus to the Sengen area and once inside lawfully to request for asylum.

<<9686.1;9692.52;en>>
And therefore, we would like to pose you a final question from our part.

<<9692.52;9695.18;en>>
What is preferable?

<<9695.18;9719.66;en>>
That anybody in need or in danger can pose a legitimate claim of entry through legal means or fuel unlawful actions for the sole benefit of hideous mafias and further suffering of migrants, EU residents, and border officers.

<<9719.66;9722.7;en>>
And that I leave it to your consideration.

<<9722.7;9722.7;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<9724.29;9727.81;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Leon Cavero.

<<9727.81;9731.65;en>>
There were questions for the UNHCR.

<<9731.65;9736.29;en>>
I wonder whether Mrs. O’hara wish to comment,

<<9736.29;9739.57;en>>
to offer some elements in reply to those questions.

<<9739.57;9740.29;en>>
You have the floor.

<<9740.29;9740.29;en>>
Thank you.

[[ThirdParty;TP1]]

<<9742.38;9744.38;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<9744.38;9755.58;en>>
We understood four questions to be in whole or in part addressed to us, and I will attempt as briefly as possible to respond to them.

<<9755.58;9778.34;en>>
Firstly, the questions that were raised amongst a set of questions by Judge Stadlmayer about potential contradiction or incoherence in the statistics that I had referred to, or my statement about the limitations of people's ability to access asylum procedures.

<<9778.34;9792.06;en>>
Just to be entirely clear about this, a number of different sets of statistics have been presented, either in written submissions and now subsequently in our oral interventions.

<<9792.06;9808.14;en>>
And to be entirely clear, what I was referring to, and here I'm making a very clear distinction between the situation before December 2014, when indeed a border post was established at Benin-Nsar, and the situation since.

<<9808.14;9811.42;en>>
So just to be clear on that, I reiterate.

<<9811.42;9830.46;en>>
Our understanding based on statistics of the Spanish authorities indicate that 12,700 asylum seekers principally from Middle Eastern and North African countries have been registered by the Spanish authorities at Benin-Nsar border post since the end of 2014.

<<9830.46;9858.54;en>>
During the same period, and we were citing this for the sake of comparison to indicate trends and the realities of the situation, as far as we are aware, approximately only 35 asylum seekers from Sub-Saharan African countries were able to be registered in the same period, and our understanding is that most of them entered the enclave by means other than through Benin-Nsar.

<<9858.54;9889.18;en>>
If I just refer briefly to the data that was provided in the submission of the Kingdom of Spain with respect to the situation before August 2014, I mean, we would just note that in terms of numbers of a citation of 21 persons that were able to access some form of a procedure through the police station in Malia prior to the establishment of the Benin-Nsar border post.

<<9889.18;9905.62;en>>
We're speaking only of 21 cases here in the period between the 1st of the 1st 2014 and the 13th of the 8th 2014, of which only six were of Sub-Saharan African nationality.

<<9905.62;9912.46;en>>
So I don't think there is any discrepancy as such between the figures that have been presented.

<<9912.46;9931.66;en>>
In a second question, which we understood to be at least partially addressed to us, Judge El-Oeski asked about the reasoning behind, and as I heard it, UNHCR's rejection of the subsequent asylum claims in Spain.

<<9931.66;9948.5;en>>
To be clear on that, I would just like to underline that we have not, in our written submissions nor in what I have said here today, we've made it very clear that we were not commenting on the merits of the subsequent asylum applications in Spain.

<<9948.5;9969.9;en>>
However, since the question has been directly asked, let me just clarify that UNHCR's role within the Spanish asylum system is the provision, according to Spanish law, of a non-binding advisory opinion which takes place in the context of accelerated admissibility procedures.

<<9969.9;9983.82;en>>
And this can happen at two stages, with an initial report when the claim is submitted, and subsequently in a second report which can happen 48 hours later if the case is under review.

<<9983.82;10008.7;en>>
And we would just observe that the very nature of those type of procedures and our role in them, in our view, underlines precisely the argumentation and the reasons why we have concerns about the lack of any kind of even minimum screening procedures which took place in the context of this case.

<<10008.7;10037.58;en>>
Not everybody who claims that they have a right to asylum will necessarily ultimately receive it, but it is in our view fundamentally important to the integrity of asylum that there is an opportunity to express that need, whether it be an asylum claim or more broadly, as has been addressed by other interveners, claims to international protection which are not necessarily defined by the limited scope of asylum.

<<10037.58;10058.9;en>>
We understood also that the question from Judge Harutyunen on the whole question of observation of smuggling routes, we understood that to be also partially addressed to us, basically what is UNHCR's observations on the involvement of organized smuggling towards the EU.

<<10058.9;10095.18;en>>
I would just like to say in context that our observation overall, and this is borne out in our annual statistics on global and regional trends to do with asylum and claims for international protection, our observation in the first part is that the vast majority of persons who have been recognized as refugees or persons of concern to UNHCR, in their overwhelming majority these persons remain in regions of origin.

<<10095.18;10100.58;en>>
So they are not the majority of people that you will necessarily find in smuggling routes.

<<10100.58;10118.3;en>>
It has however been in our experience, and we have observed as many others have and this has been documented, the involvement of quite ruthless entities smuggling or trafficking that are involved in this business.

<<10118.3;10146.62;en>>
And we as UNHCR have consistently in positions that we have taken around these issues pointed out that the extreme lack of alternative legal pathways is in our view one of the factors that fuels the recourse of persons in need of international protection to these quite ruthless groups that were referred to.

<<10146.62;10166.86;en>>
And lastly, and I will finish with this, we understood that also at least in part Judge Siciliano's questions, his set of questions were directed to us in the context of asking a question about our understanding of the link between expulsion and non-refoulement.

<<10166.86;10183.1;en>>
The question was framed in reference to the draft articles of the International Law Commission and the observations there too that non-admission or extradition considerations would not apply.

<<10183.1;10196.1;en>>
Our understanding, and I'm looking here and quoting from Article 9 of those draft articles on the prohibition of collective expulsion where Article 9.2 says the collective expulsion

<<10196.1;10218.2;en>>
of aliens is prohibited and then goes on in Subsection 3 to say that a state may expel uncommittedly the members of a group of aliens provided that the expulsion takes place after and on the basis of an assessment of the particular case of each individual member of the group in accordance with the present draft articles.

<<10218.2;10252.94;en>>
And our understanding as UNHCR of the legitimacy of a link or the relevance of our concern about these matters, the link between expulsion and non-refoulement precisely goes to the comments we have made today about the risk of a person with a legitimate claim to international protection not being able to express that concern or avail of the protection that might attach to them if there is not in fact some minimal way of them being able to express it.

<<10252.94;10281.58;en>>
And it's precisely because of our concern about the effectiveness of non-refoulement in the context of international refugee law having real content and effect that we believe that there is a need for some type of minimum at least possibility of persons to express that concern before they would be subjected to the risk of collective expulsion as was presented in the context of this case.

<<10281.58;10283.26;en>>
I leave it at that.

<<10283.26;10283.26;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<65.09;66.61;en>>
Please be seated.

<<73.33;82.93;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of Ibrahim and others versus the United Kingdom.

<<82.93;98.71;en>>
The first three applications were lodged by Mr. Muqtad Saeed Ibrahim, Mr. Ramzi Mohamed, and Mr. Yasin Omar on 22 October 2008 under Article 34 of the Convention.

<<98.71;108.69;en>>
They are Somali nationals who were born in 1978, 1981, and 81 respectively.

<<108.69;123.99;en>>
The fourth application was lodged on 29 July 2009 by Mr. Ismail Abdurahman, who was a British national born in Somalia in 1982.

<<123.99;134.37;en>>
The applications were allocated to the fourth section of the court, pursuant to Rule 52, Paragraph 1 of the rules of the court.

<<134.37;153.77;en>>
On 16 December 2014, a chamber of the fourth section declared the applications admissible as regards the complaints under Article 6 of the Convention about delayed access to legal advice and the admission of statements at trial.

<<153.77;158.65;en>>
It held that there had been no violation of that provision.

<<158.65;173.81;en>>
On 5 and 16 March 2015, the third and fourth applicants, respectively, requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention.

<<173.81;182.37;en>>
The panel of the Grand Chamber accepted these requests on 1st June 2015.

<<182.37;201.93;en>>
On 27 August 2015, the president of the Grand Chamber granted leave to Fair Trials International to submit written comments as a third party by virtue of Rule 44, Paragraph 3 of the rules of the court.

<<201.93;226.57;en>>
The government are represented by Lord Keen of Elie QC, Advocate General of Scotland Council, and by Mr. Paul McKell, Agent, assisted by Mr. David Perry QC and Mr. Louis Mably, Counsel, and by Mr. Ruaraidh Macniven and Mr. John De Sousa, Advisors.

<<226.57;242.61;en>>
The first three applicants are represented by Mr. Joel Bennathan QC, Counsel, assisted by Mr. Jude Bunting, Counsel, and by Mr. Ravi Naik and Mr. Tayab Ali, Advisors.

<<242.61;252.17;en>>
The fourth applicant is represented by Mr. John King, Counsel, assisted by Mrs. Anne Fall, Counsel.

<<252.17;256.69;en>>
I welcome the representatives in the name of the court.

<<256.69;277.09;en>>
I also welcome the following groups of judges who are attending the hearing, judges and legal advisors of the Constitutional Court of Montenegro, a group of judges from Russia, an international group of judges and prosecutors attending a seminar organized by the German Judicial Academy.

<<277.09;287.01;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and the representatives of those applicants, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<287.01;298.67;en>>
Mr. Bennathan QC for the first three applicants will speak first, and then Mr. King for the fourth applicant, and finally, Lord Keen of Elie QC for the government.

<<298.67;312.17;en>>
I would explain that in addition to interpreting in the two official languages of the court, English and French, interpreting into Montenegrin and Russian has also been authorized.

<<312.17;322.73;en>>
That interpreting has not been arranged by the court, and no transcription of the oral translation will be included in the official record of the proceedings.

<<322.73;324.93;en>>
I call Mr. Bennathan QC.

<<324.93;324.93;en>>
You have the floor, please, Mr. Bennathan.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<328.39;331.51;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<331.51;336.11;en>>
Mr. President, hard cases make bad law.

<<336.11;353.11;en>>
In times when terrorism haunts Europe, we acknowledge it may be difficult for even this court to make a finding against a member state in a terrorist case, even if the court were dealing with a member state that was happy to be corrected.

<<353.11;358.05;en>>
If there are such member states, the United Kingdom is clearly not amongst them.

<<358.05;364.17;en>>
But an old saying in the English courts is that hard cases make bad law.

<<364.17;371.83;en>>
A court can always adjust the law to get to what seems like a desirable result in a particular case.

<<371.83;380.31;en>>
But the damage done to the law will live on long after the hard case itself is forgotten.

<<380.31;383.37;en>>
Mr. President, in our submissions this morning,

<<383.37;391.95;en>>
we will first remind the court of one or two of the facts, as well as the ratio of the central case to this hearing, Saldas and Turkey.

<<391.95;401.99;en>>
We will remind the court of some of the international jurisprudence that Saldas complements and the consensus that Saldas represents.

<<401.99;410.43;en>>
We will set out some specific criticisms of the judgment of the fourth section that this court has now agreed to reconsider.

<<410.43;421.27;en>>
And finally, we will suggest there is an inconsistency and an absurdity in the legal sense to the United Kingdom's stance on safety interviews.

<<421.27;423.83;en>>
Mr. President, as the court will recollect,

<<423.83;430.87;en>>
in the case of Saldas on the 30th of May, 2001, Mr. Saldas was arrested and interviewed

<<430.87;433.67;en>>
without a lawyer present.

<<433.67;440.99;en>>
He supposedly admitted in those interviews writing a banner in support of the leader of the PKK.

<<440.99;444.59;en>>
Subsequently, Mr. Saldas told the investigating judge

<<444.59;449.15;en>>
he had not written the banner and his confession was false.

<<449.15;457.95;en>>
At his later trial, he was, like the applicants in this case, afforded full legal assistance to argue about the effect of his confession.

<<457.95;464.59;en>>
But the trial court, nonetheless, took it into account and found him guilty.

<<464.59;472.43;en>>
The judgment of this court in Saldas and Turkey seemed to make the position clear and simple to comprehend.

<<472.43;486.75;en>>
At paragraph 55 of this court's judgment, this court held that access to a lawyer should be granted before the first interrogation unless there are, quote, compelling reasons, unquote, to restrict this right.

<<486.75;489.27;en>>
But then the court went on.

<<489.27;507.99;en>>
Even where there is such a compelling reason, the rights of the defense will, in principle, be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction.

<<507.99;510.71;en>>
Mr. President, the decision in Saldas and Turkey

<<510.71;519.47;en>>
was not a sudden departure from past jurisprudence, nor was it this court casting aside international bodies' views.

<<519.47;534.03;en>>
It was the culmination of a gradual development of this court's jurisprudence, only pronounced after a thorough review of the entirely consistent views of a number of international bodies.

<<534.03;557.19;en>>
The judgments in Saldas not only aligns this court's decisions with international and domestic law, but it will do so, and it will continue to do so, unless it is undermined and damaged by the judgment of the fourth section in these applications to shortly review that international legal consensus.

<<557.19;564.91;en>>
Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union enshrines the rights for a fair trial.

<<564.91;568.67;en>>
Article 48.2 of the Charter guarantees respects

<<568.67;570.87;en>>
for the rights of the defense.

<<570.87;591.35;en>>
The relevant directive states, quote, member states shall ensure that suspects and accused persons have the right of access to a lawyer in such time and in such a manner so as to allow the persons concerned to exercise their rights of defense practically and effectively.

<<591.35;594.19;en>>
Mr. President, to send to one more detail,

<<594.19;601.19;en>>
the Charter further states, suspects or accused persons shall have access to a lawyer without undue delay.

<<601.19;615.35;en>>
In any event, they shall have access to a lawyer from whichever of the following points in time is the earliest, and the first in the list is, quote, before they are questioned by the police.

<<615.35;624.27;en>>
The stance of the European Union and this court in Saldos is also consistent with the requirements of Article 14.3d

<<624.27;632.47;en>>
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which applies as soon as an individual is arrested.

<<632.47;639.47;en>>
As a final example of comparative law, we look to the case law of the United States Supreme Court.

<<639.47;648.89;en>>
In the very well-known judgment of Miranda and Arizona, the rules governing custodial interrogation were summarized, including the following.

<<648.89;666.27;en>>
The person must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, and, quote, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, unquote.

<<666.27;667.79;en>>
Mr. President, we suggest there is

<<667.79;690.77;en>>
a clear international consensus of what can be called a simple right-line rule, a rule by which one knows one is one side of the line or the other, a rule that requires representation before questioning and which requires evidence given during questioning without representation to be excluded.

<<690.77;714.23;en>>
The complication, we would suggest, that this court addressed and elegantly resolved in Saldas is that this court, unlike the European Union laws, unlike the American laws, this court allows the maybe extreme circumstances where questioning has to take place without lawyers present.

<<714.23;720.29;en>>
Article 6 also is essentially concerned with the later trial, not the initial detention.

<<720.29;731.39;en>>
The resolution in Saldas used this court's power to lay down rules about the trial process in such a way as to honor the right-line rule.

<<731.39;736.15;en>>
And that clear decision has become the observed rule within member states.

<<736.15;743.15;en>>
In our written submissions, we give examples from the Netherlands, from France, and from the United Kingdom.

<<743.15;753.63;en>>
In Cader and Her Majesty's Advocate, the United Kingdom Supreme Court relied on Saldas as settling the law in this area.

<<753.63;772.99;en>>
In passing, we would mention that Lord Hope, dealing with the suggestion that Gafgen and Germany, which the fourth section in these applications uses a basis to disregard Saldas, Lord Hope dealing with Gafgen and the idea that Gafgen might undermine or qualify Saldas, said as follows.

<<772.99;785.87;en>>
This, the Gafgen judgment, this was a pragmatic decision which proceeded on the basis that evidence obtained in breach of Article 3 was on the facts irrelevant to the applicant's conviction.

<<785.87;794.27;en>>
I do not think it can be regarded as raising any doubt as to the decision in Saldas and Turkey.

<<794.27;796.67;en>>
Mr. President, not only was Saldas

<<796.67;811.71;en>>
reflective of an international consensus, not only has it been followed loyally and properly by member states, it's since been applied consistently in this court and by the various sections of this court.

<<811.71;815.35;en>>
It was applied in Sucre and Yildiz in Turkey.

<<815.35;831.55;en>>
It was applied in Plonka and Poland, in which the court specified neither the assistance provided subsequently by a lawyer or the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings could cure the defects which had occurred during the police custody.

<<831.55;845.03;en>>
We mention that, of course, because one of the fourth section's argument was, because there's a later trial, because there are lawyers at trial, because there's a later adversarial proceedings, somehow the earlier breach doesn't matter.

<<845.03;854.87;en>>
In Dayan and in Turkey, this court applied Saldas in facts where the accused applicant remained silent when in custody and had not confessed.

<<854.87;859.21;en>>
In Pishkalnikov and Russia, the court applied Saldas.

<<859.21;867.71;en>>
In Amutagan and Turkey, this court found a breach even though the applicant had confirmed to the trial judge the accuracy of his confession.

<<867.71;871.91;en>>
In Baikov and Russia, the Grand Chamber followed Saldas.

<<871.91;893.43;en>>
In Ushakov and Ushakov and Ukraine, the court stressed, quote, these principles are particularly called for in a case of serious charges, for it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies.

<<893.43;896.51;en>>
And in a number of other cases, Mr. President,

<<896.51;900.59;en>>
we've listed them in our written submissions.

<<900.59;904.71;en>>
We pause to pose the question with respect, why?

<<904.71;916.23;en>>
With all that body of law and with such legal consistency, why can it be that the Fourth Section avoided finding a violation in this case?

<<916.23;923.43;en>>
We would suggest the only comprehensible answer is that it was a really hard case.

<<923.43;925.79;en>>
But Mr. President, that cannot be the basis

<<925.79;934.11;en>>
to make bad law by rejecting the obvious violation of Article VI suffered by these applicants.

<<934.11;938.43;en>>
I turn, please, to the Fourth Section judgment itself.

<<938.43;950.95;en>>
Of course, our simple and fundamental criticism of the Fourth Section is, with respect, that the court set aside the clear and consistent law enunciated in Saldas.

<<950.95;955.55;en>>
But we would mention three more detailed points.

<<955.55;969.61;en>>
First, the Fourth Section attached significant weight, as of course now to the United Kingdom, to the detailed judgment given by the applicant's trial judge, Mr. Justice Fulford, as he was then.

<<969.61;974.07;en>>
The trial judge allowed the use of the safety interviews at trial.

<<974.07;978.91;en>>
We would suggest, with respect, that that is to confuse form with substance.

<<978.91;994.59;en>>
As this court has said many times and repeated in Saldas, the convention is designed to, quote, guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory, but rights that are practical and effective.

<<994.59;1005.95;en>>
In the context of this case, we would say that means the question is not whether the trial judge's ruling was detailed, lengthy, elegantly expressed.

<<1005.95;1009.11;en>>
It was all of those things.

<<1009.11;1013.31;en>>
But what was the effect it had upon the trial?

<<1013.31;1026.77;en>>
And no amount of detail and no amount of elegance of expression can make good a simple breach of what was and should remain the simple test enunciated in Saldas.

<<1026.77;1029.27;en>>
Second, Mr. President, the Fourth Section

<<1029.27;1048.39;en>>
starts its conclusion at paragraph 212 of their judgment in this case by suggesting, quote, it must be borne in mind that the applicants, not the prosecution, brought the safety interview into play at the trial, unquote.

<<1048.39;1077.63;en>>
We would suggest, with great respect, of course, that if that is a significant criterion and the position of that observation right at the start of the Fourth Section's conclusions would suggest it is, then the Saldas protection will never apply because there's no doubt in the applicant's case who sought to introduce the evidence of the safety interviews, the prosecution, and no doubt who sought to exclude them, the applicants.

<<1077.63;1090.75;en>>
The applicants are said to have, quote, brought them into play, unquote, by advancing a defense that was inconsistent with what was said when they were interviewed in the absence of lawyers.

<<1090.75;1092.75;en>>
Mr. President, there will only ever

<<1092.75;1100.43;en>>
be a potential violation if an accused is advancing a defense inconsistent with that interview.

<<1100.43;1106.47;en>>
If the defense at trial is consistent with that interview, then no harm is done.

<<1106.47;1114.07;en>>
There will never be any complaint, and the state would not have any interest in using that interview in the first place.

<<1114.07;1117.59;en>>
In Saldas, of course, in Saldas, Mr. Saldas

<<1117.59;1123.15;en>>
denied at trial that the admissions he made in interview were correct.

<<1123.15;1125.99;en>>
So Mr. Saldas, applying the logic of the fourth section

<<1125.99;1130.19;en>>
in this case, quote, brought the interviews into play.

<<1130.19;1138.51;en>>
We would suggest in virtually every case on this topic before the court, an applicant will have, quote, brought the interviews into play.

<<1142.19;1145.63;en>>
Mr. President, that simply cannot be a basis

<<1145.63;1151.07;en>>
for avoiding Saldas, or Saldas means nothing.

<<1151.07;1160.07;en>>
Third and above all, the fourth section seems to have decided these cases on the basis of the strength of the other evidence at trial.

<<1160.07;1168.31;en>>
And we suggest that is a new test, which this court, with great respect, would do well to disavow as soon as possible.

<<1168.31;1190.27;en>>
Paragraph 211, the fourth section stated, quote, finally, and this is not without some importance, the safety interview statements were far from the sole evidence in the case and have to be considered alongside the wealth of other prosecution evidence led during the seven-month trial, unquote.

<<1190.27;1196.87;en>>
On the same theme, in the same judgment in dealing with the case of the fourth applicant, Mr. King will forgive me for trespassing on his case

<<1196.87;1199.11;en>>
for just a moment.

<<1199.11;1202.41;en>>
The fourth section was even more explicit.

<<1202.41;1215.57;en>>
Paragraph 223, the court said, I quote, finally, and most importantly, a great deal of other incriminating evidence was placed before the jury, unquote.

<<1215.57;1238.71;en>>
It's our submission that the suggestion by the fourth section that what would otherwise be a violation will not be if there is ample other evidence is a new development that, if allowed to take root, will allow any government and any prosecutor a ready route to avoid almost all the protections proffered by Article VI.

<<1238.71;1247.75;en>>
We would suggest there are a number of reasons with respect why this court should disown the fourth section's reasoning on this topic.

<<1247.75;1252.23;en>>
First, it's not founded in the court's own precedent.

<<1252.23;1264.71;en>>
The precedents relied on for this new principle set out in paragraph 196E of the fourth section judgment of Saldas, Yoldas, and Zachenko.

<<1264.71;1281.03;en>>
We would suggest the point made in those cases is not an assessment of the weight of all the other evidence in those trials, but a far simpler question of whether the impugned answers from interviews played a significant part in the subsequent trials.

<<1281.03;1300.31;en>>
In support of that submission, we remind this court of Lord Hope's analysis in Cadha that Gafgen, a case the fourth section also relied on, Gafgen was, quote, a pragmatic decision on the basis that the evidence obtained in breach of Article III was irrelevant to the applicant's conviction.

<<1300.31;1314.07;en>>
In Yoldas, another case the fourth section relied upon for what we say is a new and dangerous principle, in Yoldas, the court found no violation as there had been a genuine waiver of the offer of representation.

<<1314.07;1318.15;en>>
And the comments then made in interview had been repeated before a judge.

<<1318.15;1325.91;en>>
So one can see that in Yoldas, the comments made without lawyers could be seen as irrelevant to the later convictions.

<<1325.91;1335.21;en>>
And we note in passing that Yoldas has been relied upon by two subsequent judgments, never on this point, purely about waiver of rights.

<<1335.21;1343.71;en>>
In Saldas, this court found a violation after making the point that the comments made without lawyers had played a part in the conviction.

<<1343.71;1346.77;en>>
In Zachenko, the court made the same point.

<<1346.77;1360.75;en>>
We suggest, with respect, the proper question about the evidence at an applicant's trial, following the same analysis as Lord Hope, is were the impugned answers significant evidence at the applicant's trial?

<<1360.75;1363.39;en>>
In this case, the answer to that question is clear.

<<1363.39;1372.63;en>>
The safety interviews were, in the words of the trial judge, quote, of high relevance, unquote, to the central question raised in the trial.

<<1372.63;1385.31;en>>
The court of appeal in the applicant's case said, quote, if the records of the police interviews were properly admitted, they were sufficient on their own to utterly undermine, unquote, the defense at trial.

<<1388.67;1397.03;en>>
The second problem with relying on the strength of the other evidence is that evidence can grow or contract over time.

<<1397.03;1408.99;en>>
If the fourth section was correct in their analysis, then whether or not there was a violation of Article VI could come and go retrospectively, depending how the evidence unfolds.

<<1408.99;1411.07;en>>
This is not a theoretical point, Mr. President.

<<1411.07;1431.63;en>>
In the linked case of Acehedo, who was a defendant at the applicant's original trial, in the linked case of Acehedo in the court of appeal earlier this year, it was revealed that the key prosecution scientific witness at the applicant's trial had been criticized in writing by other government scientists.

<<1431.63;1445.59;en>>
And those documents, those criticisms, were not made known to the defense at trial, when according to Lord Hughes in Acehedo earlier this year, they were, quote, clearly disclosable and plainly they should have been, unquote.

<<1445.59;1455.43;en>>
Yet because that evidence, now cast in doubt, was before the trial court on the reasoning for the fourth section, it cured the violation of Article VI.

<<1455.43;1473.71;en>>
Third and finally on this subject, if it's the court's purpose to guard the rights guaranteed by the convention so they are practical and effective, what is the effect of introducing a weight of the evidence test in place of the bright line test?

<<1473.71;1490.59;en>>
With a weight of the evidence test, it becomes open to any prosecutor to argue that although an accused should have had legal representation at interview, the rest of the evidence is really very compelling and therefore the interview comments should be admitted.

<<1490.59;1499.51;en>>
And it's open to any member state's trial or appellate court to allow such interviews into evidence on the same basis.

<<1499.51;1514.83;en>>
In one of the cases relied upon by the fourth section, Sochenko, this court commented, I quote, it is not the court's role to examine whether the evidence in the present case was correctly assessed by the national courts.

<<1514.83;1532.15;en>>
If one combines the fact this court is not going to undertake a re-evaluation of the weight of the evidence with the fourth section's ruling that the weight of the evidence can avoid a violation, well, what is left of the effective supervisory functions of this court?

<<1532.15;1537.07;en>>
What is left of the protection offered to arrested people?

<<1537.07;1539.27;en>>
Mr. President, the alternative, and of course,

<<1539.27;1550.15;en>>
it's what we urge upon this court, is to reinstate the simple, clear protection that so many courts thought was established in Saldus.

<<1550.15;1554.55;en>>
Lawyer present except in exceptional circumstances.

<<1554.55;1559.79;en>>
If no lawyer is present, no use of the interviews permitted at trial.

<<1559.79;1565.27;en>>
Simple, easy to comprehend, and effective.

<<1565.27;1568.15;en>>
Mr. President, finally, we address three observations

<<1568.15;1573.43;en>>
to the position and the stance of the United Kingdom government.

<<1573.43;1583.67;en>>
Firstly, the United Kingdom's entire justification for the safety interview regime is that its purpose is non-evidential.

<<1583.67;1588.51;en>>
It is solely to seek to identify real and immediate dangers.

<<1588.51;1600.11;en>>
If that is the only reason for carrying out these interviews, it can scarcely be unfair to limit the use of such interviews to the purpose that justified them in the first place.

<<1600.11;1620.67;en>>
Second, in gratefully adopting the reasoning of the fourth section, as the United Kingdom government does, the government argues this was a case where there was ample other evidence of guilt, and therefore, there was no violation of Article 6 by their introduction of the interviews, nor would there be in other such cases.

<<1620.67;1636.17;en>>
Legally speaking, the absurdity of that position is that it's only in cases where they add very little, or where they amount to further evidence when there's already plenty, that these unrepresented interviews should be allowed into evidence.

<<1636.17;1650.19;en>>
To be intellectually consistent, the government must be saying that these interviews should be admitted when they're not needed by the state to prove its case, but not admitted when they are needed by the state to prove its case.

<<1650.19;1653.91;en>>
Legally, as we say, absurd.

<<1653.91;1657.07;en>>
Mr. President, finally on the United Kingdom's stance,

<<1657.07;1668.47;en>>
the dangers of not establishing a bright line rule are evident both in the United Kingdom courts and in the arguments set out by the government for these proceedings.

<<1668.47;1675.67;en>>
In the United Kingdom courts, safety interviews are now being adduced at other trials.

<<1675.67;1690.95;en>>
In July at the Central Criminal Court, just for an example, once all the relevant authorities, including the fourth section judgment in this case, were placed before a high court judge, in came the safety interviews carried out without a lawyer present.

<<1690.95;1694.15;en>>
No clear rule, no protection.

<<1694.15;1696.23;en>>
Mr. President, in the government's argument

<<1696.23;1712.23;en>>
to this court, the government's written submissions, it is said at paragraph 53 that even if there was denial of representation for no proper reason, it would still be possible for them to be relied upon at trial.

<<1712.23;1716.63;en>>
I started these submissions with one English saying.

<<1716.63;1718.95;en>>
I draw to a close with another.

<<1718.95;1723.63;en>>
Give them an inch and they will take a mile.

<<1723.63;1726.11;en>>
Mr. President, we do not for a moment

<<1726.11;1735.59;en>>
underestimate the controversy of cases such as these, where those denounced as terrorists seek the protection of this court for their human rights.

<<1735.59;1751.79;en>>
Yet, with the greatest of respect, it is only by guaranteeing practical and effective rights in the most serious cases that the rights of hundreds of millions of citizens of all member states are given the protection that the convention demands.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<1755.53;1758.33;en>>
Thank you very much Mr. Bennathan.

<<1758.33;1759.33;en>>
I call Mr. King.

<<1759.33;1761.97;en>>
Mr. King please.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<1765.28;1768.84;en>>
Mr. President, in the case of the fourth applicant,

<<1768.84;1772.24;en>>
Mr. Abdirahman, the United Kingdom government

<<1772.24;1795.54;en>>
accepts that there were significant breaches of the codes of practice laid down by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, including failure to caution, failure to inform him of his right to access to a lawyer, failure to tape record the interview, and a failure to adopt the safety interview provisions.

<<1795.54;1811.28;en>>
The fourth applicant was, therefore, deliberately questioned unlawfully for more than 10 hours, despite the interviewing officers considering him to be incriminating himself.

<<1811.28;1817.68;en>>
They knew he was a suspect with one hour of questioning him.

<<1817.68;1822.68;en>>
And this, again, is accepted by the United Kingdom.

<<1822.68;1843.0;en>>
In the false belief, therefore, that he was a witness for the prosecution, the fourth applicant continued to give detailed, self-incriminating information to the police from 6.15 PM on the 27th of July, 2005,

<<1843.0;1848.92;en>>
until 5 AM on the 28th of July, 2005.

<<1848.92;1864.68;en>>
Moreover, the interviewing officers stated at trial that they conveyed the impression to him that he would be released at the end of his witness statement when he had signed it.

<<1864.68;1876.4;en>>
The fourth applicant, therefore, acted on that representation and made a confession that was eventually recorded by the police in the form of a witness statement.

<<1879.52;1901.96;en>>
European case law and the European Parliament's directive recognize the right to silence and the right of access to a lawyer at the very, these two rights are at the very essence of a fair trial, as we've just heard from Mr. Benetton.

<<1901.96;1908.28;en>>
The right of access to a lawyer can be derogated in a very limited way.

<<1908.28;1920.26;en>>
Firstly, when there are compelling reasons and the derogation of that right is restricted to matters of national security and it's temporary.

<<1920.26;1923.16;en>>
The directive does not derogate the right to remain silent.

<<1923.16;1926.84;en>>
Trespassing slightly on Mr. Benetton's case,

<<1926.84;1934.72;en>>
and I'm sure he'll forgive me too, Yasser Omar, the third applicant, was the first to be arrested.

<<1934.72;1939.56;en>>
He was then subjected to five separate safety interviews.

<<1939.56;1948.4;en>>
These occurred on the 27th of July prior to the fourth applicant being questioned as a witness by the police.

<<1948.4;1963.68;en>>
As a direct result of the directives as a direct result of Yasser Omar's failure to give any information to the police, they decided to breach the fourth applicant's convention rights.

<<1963.68;1971.68;en>>
This course of action, we say, cannot amount to a compelling reason to derogate from the fourth applicant's rights.

<<1971.68;1993.92;en>>
Even if there were compelling reasons to restrict the right of the fourth applicant or his rights, the restriction of his rights should have been restricted to a safety interview under the domestic legal framework existing at the time and should have been temporary.

<<1993.92;2000.4;en>>
On the contrary, the fourth applicant was not even made aware that he was a suspect.

<<2000.4;2006.66;en>>
He was deliberately and dishonestly misinformed that he was a witness.

<<2006.66;2029.24;en>>
It was therefore not realistic that he should consider making a request for the assistance of a lawyer while making this statement, contrary to the observations made by the fourth section in the December judgment 2014.

<<2029.24;2042.48;en>>
Therefore, the manner in which the police treated the fourth applicant was a flagrant breach of the principles of European case law, Article 6, and the directive.

<<2042.48;2047.96;en>>
We now move on to the use made of the statement at trial.

<<2047.96;2059.08;en>>
The offense of assisting an offender particularized six acts of assistance that the applicant was alleged to have given to Mr. Osmond.

<<2059.08;2072.84;en>>
As a matter of interest, the trial judge directed the jury that they need only be satisfied so that they feel sure that he carried out one of these acts in order to convict him.

<<2072.84;2090.48;en>>
The evidence in respect of the first three particularized acts were offering Hussain Osmond accommodation in London, providing him with accommodation and food at 61 Newport Street, London, and providing him with fresh clothing.

<<2090.48;2095.6;en>>
These three acts were established mainly upon his witness statement.

<<2095.6;2124.2;en>>
But even more significantly, the information given in the witness statement formed the sole basis for the prosecution's case against the fourth applicant in respect of the three offenses of failing to disclose information about the other bombers, namely Muqtar Ibrahim, Yasser Omar, and Ramzi Mohammed.

<<2124.2;2136.94;en>>
Therefore, the observations made at paragraph 216 of the judgment of the fourth section are factually inaccurate and wrong.

<<2136.94;2165.44;en>>
Where it was said, it is significant that the contents of the fourth applicant's witness statement support the contention that the police interview is not directed at establishing the extent of his own role in the commission of a criminal offense, but obtaining details about the terror plot and planning, identifying the alleged bombers and those who are providing them with assistance, and ascertaining the whereabouts of Osmond.

<<2165.44;2176.6;en>>
Far from being an information gathering exercise, that witness statement went to the very heart of the prosecution's case against the fourth applicant.

<<2176.6;2185.66;en>>
Indeed, it was all there was in relation to the three offenses of failing to provide information.

<<2185.66;2196.5;en>>
And of course, this is further demonstrated in the trial process, where the prosecution relied upon the witness statement as a confession.

<<2196.5;2210.38;en>>
It's artificial to place reliance on what's been described as corroborative evidence to uphold a conviction in this case, where the main prosecution evidence stemmed from the witness statement.

<<2210.38;2217.88;en>>
For example, the corroborative evidence in respect of the fourth applicant obtaining a passport from Mr. Hossein Osmond

<<2217.88;2224.04;en>>
was based largely upon the self-serving evidence of a co-defendant, Mr. Sharif, who

<<2224.04;2229.48;en>>
was disbelieved by the jury as he was convicted, and Mr. Osmond, his brother, who gave evidence

<<2229.48;2231.48;en>>
as a convicted terrorist.

<<2231.48;2236.24;en>>
And the only other piece of evidence was inconclusive cell site evidence.

<<2239.0;2244.86;en>>
Likewise, the significance of a camera obtained by the applicant from Mr. Osmond

<<2244.86;2250.24;en>>
only makes sense in the context of his witness statements.

<<2250.24;2262.08;en>>
It would be highly speculative to conclude that the applicant would have been convicted without the use of the witness statement.

<<2262.08;2271.78;en>>
In addition, it's very relevant that the witness statement dealt with the reasons why the fourth applicant allowed Hossein Osmond to stay in his flat.

<<2271.78;2288.64;en>>
On any view, the witness statement cannot be regarded as being restricted to a need to obtain, as a matter of critical urgency, information on any further planned attacks and the identities of those potentially involved in the plot.

<<2288.64;2300.12;en>>
The witness statement specifically deals with the fourth applicant's state of mind, and thereby provided the mental element of the alleged offenses.

<<2300.12;2313.3;en>>
The legislative framework in place to govern the admissibility of the witness statement and the subsequent criminal proceedings failed to adequately safeguard the fourth applicant's rights because the statement was admitted.

<<2313.3;2326.92;en>>
The judge, in summing up to the jury, said, breach of the code, however, does not lead to automatic rejection as evidence of a written statement made by a witness, who later is made a defendant.

<<2326.92;2350.92;en>>
If you are sure that despite the breaches of the code, the statement was freely given in the sense that he would have said those things, whether or not he was cautioned, and even if all the rules in the code had been followed and that it was true, then you will take it into account when considering your verdicts in relation to Abdirahman, the fourth applicant.

<<2350.92;2369.4;en>>
If a citizen's fundamental rights can be violated in the manner as they were in this case, then the executive power can act unlawfully, knowing that the evidence obtained will be admitted at trial, thereby circumventing fundamental convention rights.

<<2369.4;2377.2;en>>
The case of the fourth applicant can be distinguished from the cases of the first three applicants, both legally and factually.

<<2377.2;2379.72;en>>
The witness statement was self-incriminating.

<<2379.72;2384.52;en>>
In the case of the first three applicants, the safety interviews were exculpatory.

<<2384.52;2388.24;en>>
The first three applicants were given safety interviews.

<<2388.24;2391.44;en>>
Mr. Abdirahman was not.

<<2391.44;2395.28;en>>
This right was denied to the fourth applicant.

<<2395.28;2411.68;en>>
At paragraph 213 of the Chamber Justice Act, of the judgment of the fourth section, the court found that there was careful application of that legislative framework by the police in the three applicants' cases.

<<2411.68;2423.12;en>>
Unlike the fourth applicant, the first three were aware that they were suspects, and they were questioned under caution.

<<2423.12;2430.76;en>>
The safety interviews were conducted on the sole basis of the need to obtain the information.

<<2434.84;2437.88;en>>
The first three applicants were involved in acts of terrorism.

<<2437.88;2440.12;en>>
Mr. Abdirahman was not.

<<2440.12;2454.0;en>>
Therefore, in our submission, there are a greater number of violations of the fourth applicant's convention rights, and the violations were more serious and flagrant.

<<2454.0;2462.6;en>>
We recognize the immense degree of public revulsion, which has quite properly attached itself to terrorist activities.

<<2462.6;2479.6;en>>
However, it is significant that in taking into account the circumstances of the offense, the court should take into account the personal circumstances of the fourth applicant, as each case must be viewed on its own particular facts.

<<2479.6;2487.84;en>>
The fourth applicant has not been involved in the preparation for or the commission of a terrorist act.

<<2487.84;2491.44;en>>
He did not have prior knowledge of the attempted bombings.

<<2491.44;2497.88;en>>
He was not part of a matrix of people who were involved in the preparation or commission of acts of terrorism.

<<2497.88;2503.2;en>>
There was no evidence that the fourth applicant had extremist views and supported suicide bombings.

<<2503.2;2511.36;en>>
It is accepted by the United Kingdom that it was a chance meeting between the fourth applicant and to St. Osman that drew him into the criminal justice

<<2511.36;2513.6;en>>
process.

<<2513.6;2526.18;en>>
While it is true to say that great weight must be attached to the nature of offenses involved in this case, this balance, again, against the conduct of the police must be maintained.

<<2526.18;2530.96;en>>
They deceived the fourth applicant into believing that he was a witness for the prosecution.

<<2530.96;2536.8;en>>
They purposefully breached his right to remain silent and his privilege against self-incrimination.

<<2536.8;2541.4;en>>
They denied his right of access to a lawyer and thereby acted unlawfully.

<<2541.4;2545.76;en>>
In our submission, these breaches were blatant and extremely serious.

<<2545.76;2550.6;en>>
There was a total disregard to the rules governing the treatment of a suspect.

<<2550.6;2559.12;en>>
Such conduct on the part of those who are responsible for criminal prosecution should be discouraged as a matter of public policy.

<<2559.12;2571.76;en>>
At the pretrial stage, the fourth applicant was made particularly vulnerable by virtue of being deliberately misled by the police that he was a witness when, in fact, he was a suspect.

<<2571.76;2589.24;en>>
In Saldus, as we've heard, the court found that even when compelling reasons may exceptionally justify the denial of access to a lawyer, such restrictions, whatever its justification, must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article VI.

<<2589.24;2602.52;en>>
The rights of the defense will, in principle, be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction, as in this case.

<<2602.52;2609.72;en>>
The prejudice is even greater, if that's possible, when a self-incriminating statement has been obtained by deception.

<<2609.72;2617.04;en>>
It is submitted that the conduct of the police brings into dispute the integrity of the executive body.

<<2617.04;2620.32;en>>
It's the court's function to exercise control over the executive.

<<2620.32;2631.4;en>>
This includes the executive power delegated to the police as servants of the state in their investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses.

<<2631.4;2642.14;en>>
The investigative stage is crucial in the trial process, hence why Article VI protects the rights of suspects at this stage.

<<2642.14;2661.22;en>>
For the court to reject the fourth applicant's case, it would endorse executive lawlessness, thereby undermining fundamental rights protected by Article VI, the integrity of the trial process, and ultimately, the rule of law.

<<2661.22;2675.66;en>>
It's further submitted that if the court rejects the fourth applicant's case, it would be contrary to Article VI III, the right to a fair trial, and Article III II of the directive, the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings.

<<2675.66;2675.66;en>>
Those are my submissions, and I thank you for your attention.

Now for the UK government, I call Lord Keen of Elie.

<<2687.34;2688.34;en>>
You have the floor, Lord Keen, please.

<<2688.34;2688.34;en>>
Thank you.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<2690.01;2693.77;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<2693.77;2709.07;en>>
At the outset, the United Kingdom government wished to emphasize its commitment to the values of Article 6, and in particular, the importance of the component rights in Article 6, Paragraph 3.

<<2709.07;2717.89;en>>
Indeed, the fundamental nature of the right to legal advice in domestic law reflects this court's jurisprudence in this area.

<<2717.89;2729.69;en>>
It is one of the fundamental features of a fair trial, and its intrinsic aim is to contribute to ensuring the fairness of the proceedings as a whole.

<<2729.69;2734.05;en>>
The right to legal advice is enshrined in statute.

<<2734.05;2746.77;en>>
One of its aspects, the aspect material to this case, is that a suspect in police detention has the right to consult privately with a legal representative before he is interviewed.

<<2746.77;2752.33;en>>
And he has the right to have that representative present during the interview.

<<2752.33;2762.01;en>>
Equally consistent with this court's case law and the true content of Article 6, the right is not absolute.

<<2762.01;2769.57;en>>
In England, it may exceptionally be temporarily restricted for compelling reasons.

<<2769.57;2778.37;en>>
It has been established in each of the present cases that the reasons for the restriction were compelling.

<<2778.37;2786.15;en>>
Importantly, in English law, the restriction of the right to legal advice is never automatic or systematic.

<<2786.15;2790.65;en>>
It may only be exercised on a case-by-case basis.

<<2790.65;2801.95;en>>
What is required is an individual decision taking account of the particular circumstances of the case in accordance with a specific statutory scheme.

<<2801.95;2820.33;en>>
If the right is restricted, the accused is given the opportunity not just to challenge the authenticity of any statement made in the absence of his lawyer, but also to oppose its use by challenging its admissibility, which is determined by the trial judge.

<<2820.33;2829.25;en>>
The questions which are highly material in any assessment of this matter are, first, was the restriction justified?

<<2829.25;2840.37;en>>
And second, in light of the restriction, what effect would the admission of the statement have on the overall fairness of the proceedings?

<<2840.37;2857.59;en>>
As noted in the dissenting judgment of Judge Sipancic in the court's recent decision of Dvorsky and Kreyscher, in some continental systems, the principle of free discernment of evidence means that evidence cannot be excluded by the court.

<<2857.59;2861.09;en>>
In England, the position is different.

<<2861.09;2869.21;en>>
The judge is vested with broad powers to rule that evidence is legally inadmissible or should be excluded as a matter of fairness.

<<2874.77;2887.85;en>>
Just as there is no blanket rule that a statement made in the absence of a lawyer is automatically admissible as evidence, nor is there a blanket rule that such a statement must be excluded.

<<2887.85;2909.49;en>>
Such a hard-edged, inflexible rule would be entirely out of keeping with the practice in England, which is instead to determine the question of admissibility by assessing the particular circumstances of a case and reaching conclusions as to the overall fairness of the proceedings.

<<2909.49;2919.61;en>>
The government submit that the domestic approach is also consistent with the approach this court has repeatedly taken when examining complaints in this area.

<<2919.61;2928.65;en>>
This court has eschewed laying down hard-edged, inflexible rules, in particular in relation to the admissibility of evidence.

<<2928.65;2941.73;en>>
Such rules are likely to be unwieldy and arbitrary in their result, leading to the exclusion of relevant evidence even where, on any view, its admission would not render a trial unfair.

<<2941.73;2955.69;en>>
They are also likely to cut across the well-developed and sophisticated processes by which domestic courts, particularly those exercising a common law jurisdiction, determine questions of admissibility.

<<2955.69;2970.45;en>>
Instead, the approach taken by this court has been to examine whether the restriction of component rights was justified to reach conclusions in relation to Article VI, having regard to the criminal proceedings as a whole.

<<2970.45;2979.97;en>>
This was the approach taken by the chamber, and the government submit that the approach, reasoning, and conclusion of the chamber was correct.

<<2979.97;2990.93;en>>
There are also two important factual matters which are relevant to any assessment of the applications before this court, and I want to make reference to them at the outset.

<<2990.93;3001.35;en>>
The first is that the justification for restricting access to legal advice in each case has been clearly established as compelling.

<<3001.35;3010.13;en>>
Two weeks before, 52 people had been murdered by suicide bombers on the London Underground and on a London bus.

<<3010.13;3020.73;en>>
The situation faced by the police was that a second attack was underway, and the imperative on the capital's law enforcement agencies was to protect lives.

<<3020.73;3037.25;en>>
Operating in an emergency situation under severe practical constraints, the reason access to lawyers was restricted was, as the chamber has found, to address an exceptionally serious and imminent threat to public safety.

<<3037.25;3047.27;en>>
Secondly, the statements made by the applicants in the absence of legal advice was not the central platform of the prosecution's case against them.

<<3047.27;3056.65;en>>
The statements could not be characterized as decisive evidence within the meaning of this court's jurisprudence or evidence on which the convictions were founded.

<<3056.65;3064.73;en>>
The short point is that there was other evidence against the applicants which provided a very strong case of guilt.

<<3064.73;3079.69;en>>
These two matters relating to the circumstances of the particular applications, the compelling justification for the restriction, and the strength of the evidence against the applicants have been recognized by each tribunal at every stage.

<<3079.69;3086.69;en>>
That is, by the Crown Court at first instance, by the Court of Appeal, and by the chamber.

<<3086.69;3098.69;en>>
And at each stage, the courts have, after careful scrutiny, concluded that the applicants had a fair trial and that there was no violation of Article 6.

<<3098.69;3102.61;en>>
May I turn to the relevant domestic scheme in relation to the right to legal advice.

<<3105.73;3112.85;en>>
The relevant scheme in terrorism cases is set out in Schedule 8 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

<<3112.85;3128.21;en>>
Paragraph 7 of the schedule provides that a person detained in connection with a terrorism offense shall be entitled, if he so requests, to consult a solicitor as soon as is reasonably practicable, privately, and at any time.

<<3128.21;3135.89;en>>
The right is subject to paragraph 8, which sets out the circumstances in which the right may be restricted.

<<3135.89;3144.45;en>>
There are a number of important features in relation to the operation of this paragraph, to which I would like to draw this court's attention.

<<3144.45;3150.29;en>>
First, access to legal advice may only be restricted for good cause.

<<3150.29;3157.41;en>>
The restriction may only be authorized for the purpose of preventing one of the consequences set out in subparagraph 4.

<<3157.41;3169.01;en>>
In essence, this means that a restriction may only be authorized for the purpose of preventing the compromise of a terrorist investigation, physical injury, or acts of terrorism.

<<3169.01;3176.61;en>>
The prevention of these matters would provide a clear and compelling justification for the restriction of the right.

<<3176.61;3185.33;en>>
Secondly, the restriction of the right to legal advice requires an individual decision to be taken in an individual case.

<<3185.33;3200.81;en>>
Legal advice may only be delayed if a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent, that is an officer of senior rank, has reasonable grounds to believe that the exercise of the right will have one of the consequences in subparagraph 4.

<<3200.81;3209.37;en>>
Moreover, the question of whether the senior officer has reasonable grounds is both a subjective and an objective question.

<<3209.37;3217.77;en>>
Not only must the senior officer have the requisite belief, but the belief must be founded on grounds that are objectively reasonable.

<<3217.77;3224.21;en>>
All of this focuses the decision in any case on the particular circumstances that have arisen.

<<3224.21;3230.61;en>>
There is nothing automatic or systematic about delaying access to a lawyer in a terrorist case.

<<3230.61;3237.69;en>>
This feature provides a striking contrast with the domestic procedure the court examined in Sardines and Turkey.

<<3240.29;3244.45;en>>
Thirdly, the restriction on the right is limited in time.

<<3244.45;3251.25;en>>
The effect of subparagraph 2 is that access to legal advice cannot be delayed for more than 48 hours.

<<3251.25;3263.53;en>>
Even where access has been delayed, the effect of subparagraph 8 is that where the reason for authorizing the delay ceases to subsist, there can be no further delay pursuant to that authorization.

<<3263.53;3270.27;en>>
Therefore, the restriction under consideration falls within strict prescribed limits.

<<3270.27;3278.25;en>>
Finally, it should be noted that this is a formal scheme which imposes procedural obligations on the police if it is exercised.

<<3278.25;3287.77;en>>
Any restriction must be communicated to the suspect and the authorization and the reason for it must be recorded in writing.

<<3287.77;3292.13;en>>
The government submit that this scheme is consistent with Article 6.

<<3292.13;3295.05;en>>
It does not go beyond what is necessary.

<<3295.05;3297.33;en>>
It is strictly limited in time.

<<3297.33;3305.65;en>>
And for the reason I will go on to explain, it does not prejudice the overall fairness of criminal proceedings.

<<3305.65;3313.29;en>>
I would like to turn now to the way in which a statement made to the police when access to a lawyer has been restricted is treated in the English trial process.

<<3316.93;3322.33;en>>
As I've already said, there is no blanket rule that a statement of this kind is inadmissible.

<<3322.33;3333.21;en>>
The question of admissibility will depend on the circumstances of the case, and in particular, whether having regard to the circumstances, it would be unfair to admit the statement.

<<3333.21;3338.77;en>>
The trial court has two important powers in relation to statements made by an accused.

<<3338.77;3347.69;en>>
First, the court has the power to rule that a confession is inadmissible under Section 76 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.

<<3347.69;3353.33;en>>
A confession includes any statement which is wholly or partly adverse to the person who made it.

<<3353.33;3374.37;en>>
If the admissibility of the confession is challenged by the accused, the confession will be inadmissible unless the prosecution proved to the court beyond reasonable doubt that it was not obtained by oppression or in consequence of anything said or done which was likely to render any confession made by the accused unreliable.

<<3374.37;3376.85;en>>
This is an important safeguard.

<<3376.85;3391.41;en>>
It means that if, in the opinion of the judge, the delay in legal advice may have amounted to oppression or may, in the circumstances, have been likely to render a confession unreliable, the accused statement will not be admitted before the jury.

<<3391.41;3399.09;en>>
The second power the trial court has is the general exclusionary power under Section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.

<<3399.09;3419.81;en>>
Under this section, the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the prosecution relies to be admitted if it appears to the court that having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, its admission would have such an adverse effect on the proceedings that it ought not to be admitted.

<<3419.81;3428.37;en>>
In exercising this broad discretion, a judge is thus able to consider matters bearing upon the authenticity of the evidence as a preliminary issue.

<<3431.41;3441.45;en>>
A challenge to the admissibility of the statement takes place during a voir dire in which evidence is called before the judge concerning the circumstances in which the statement was made.

<<3441.45;3449.77;en>>
The procedure is fully adversarial, and the parties have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and to make submissions to the court.

<<3449.77;3458.01;en>>
The decision of the judge determining the question of admissibility is set out in a reasoned judgment, which, if necessary, can be scrutinized on appeal.

<<3464.41;3472.41;en>>
The nature of the voir dire procedure in the court's power necessarily focuses the judge's determination on the particular facts of the case.

<<3472.41;3476.13;en>>
This is evidence on the facts of the present applications.

<<3476.13;3488.33;en>>
In the case of the first three applicants, the circumstances in which the statements were made, the justification for the restrictions, and the overall fairness of the proceedings were explored in great detail.

<<3488.33;3495.93;en>>
The judgment of the trial judge extended to 171 paragraphs, which are summarized in the chamber judgment.

<<3495.93;3505.45;en>>
The extensive examination of the facts and a careful and detailed judgment were also features of the fourth applicant's case, again summarized in the chamber judgment.

<<3505.45;3511.33;en>>
At the center of these judgments was a recognition of the fundamental nature of the right to legal advice.

<<3511.33;3523.95;en>>
An examination of the justification for the actions of the police to restrict access, and an assessment of the impact of the admission of the statements on the overall fairness of the proceedings.

<<3523.95;3531.21;en>>
The procedures adopted and the reasoning and conclusions of the trial judges were upheld by the Court of Appeal.

<<3531.21;3539.97;en>>
Finally on this topic, the government would wish to observe that the decision of the judge on admissibility is not the end of the matter.

<<3539.97;3555.81;en>>
Once the evidence is admitted before the jury, the defense had the opportunity to challenge the accuracy, reliability, and relevance of the evidence through cross-examination and at the end of the trial by making submissions to the jury.

<<3555.81;3567.81;en>>
The significance of a statement, if there is found to be any, is ultimately a matter of fact for the jury to determine, subject to directions the trial judge may give in relation to the correct approach.

<<3567.81;3573.77;en>>
In the present case, the jury were given careful judicial directions.

<<3573.77;3581.97;en>>
The procedure I have outlined to this court is a fundamental feature of the common law system.

<<3581.97;3586.93;en>>
It is inconsistent with the adoption of blanket rules in relation to admissibility.

<<3586.93;3598.09;en>>
Instead, the procedure seeks to ensure that relevant evidence is placed before the jury, whilst at the same time ensuring that the rights of the defense are respected.

<<3598.09;3601.37;en>>
May I turn now to this court's case law.

<<3601.37;3607.55;en>>
I would like to begin by making some observations on the nature of the right to legal advice.

<<3607.55;3613.07;en>>
There are two overarching matters of principle which are clear from the case law.

<<3613.07;3623.69;en>>
The first matter of principle is that access to legal advice at the investigative stage is to be regarded as a fundamental aspect of a fair trial.

<<3623.69;3629.61;en>>
The second overarching matter of principle is that whilst the right is fundamental, it is not absolute.

<<3633.21;3641.17;en>>
As the chamber noted, the court has always recognized that the right to legal assistance could be subject to restrictions for good cause.

<<3641.17;3656.87;en>>
This approach recognizes that the guarantees in paragraph 3 of article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair trial, which must be taken into account in any evaluation, but that they are not an end in themselves.

<<3656.87;3674.69;en>>
Compliance with the requirements of a fair trial must be examined in each case having regard to the development of the proceedings as a whole, and not on the basis of an isolated consideration of only one of the guarantees set out in paragraph 3 of article 6.

<<3674.69;3681.01;en>>
It is noteworthy that the first three applicants seek to upset this consistent and well-established approach.

<<3681.01;3685.83;en>>
I refer to paragraph 27 of the memorial submitted on their behalf.

<<3685.83;3699.33;en>>
They contend that there should be, and I quote, a bright line rule, unquote, that all criminal suspects are entitled as a bare minimum to access to legal advice before they are questioned.

<<3699.33;3707.81;en>>
The government submit that it is certainly the case that there is an entitlement to such advice, as the court's case law and the English statutory scheme make clear.

<<3707.81;3712.31;en>>
However, there is no justification for an absolute rule.

<<3712.31;3716.01;en>>
There are three points the government wish to make on this point.

<<3716.01;3727.17;en>>
First, an absolute rule would be inflexible and fail to take account of the fact that there are legitimate and compelling reasons which justify departure from the normal position.

<<3727.17;3738.49;en>>
In other words, it fails to address the fact that at the investigative stage, the rights of a suspect may be competing with other important public interest factors.

<<3738.49;3744.37;en>>
Second, article 6 itself does not make provision for an absolute rule.

<<3744.37;3750.57;en>>
As a matter of principle, the guarantees in paragraph 3 of article 6 are not absolute guarantees.

<<3750.57;3759.25;en>>
They are specific aspects of a fair trial, which have to be considered when evaluating whether overall the proceedings were fair.

<<3759.25;3765.95;en>>
The call for a bright line rule therefore misconstrues the true content of article 6.

<<3765.95;3770.49;en>>
Third, there is no support for an absolute rule in the case law.

<<3770.49;3772.65;en>>
Quite the reverse.

<<3772.65;3780.73;en>>
This court's jurisprudence makes clear that the right to legal advice is not absolute and may be restricted for good cause.

<<3780.73;3789.29;en>>
The clear and consistent position adopted by this court is that if access to legal advice is restricted, a trial may nevertheless be fair.

<<3792.85;3798.89;en>>
The next matter I wish to address is the circumstances in which the rights of legal advice may be restricted.

<<3798.89;3802.41;en>>
This court's case law is equally clear on this matter.

<<3802.41;3809.93;en>>
The right may be restricted if in the particular circumstances of the case there are compelling reasons for doing so.

<<3809.93;3817.21;en>>
I refer to Saldo's itself at paragraph 55, as well as the chamber's judgment at paragraph 193.

<<3817.21;3823.33;en>>
In conducting any evaluation, the court will focus on why the authorities restricted the right.

<<3823.33;3842.09;en>>
It is noteworthy that in Saldo's itself and the other Turkish cases relied on by the first three applicants at paragraph 34 of their memorial, the restriction which led to a violation of article 6 was systematic and was not based on any individual consideration of the particular circumstances of the case.

<<3842.09;3849.09;en>>
And in the other cases, there was simply no justification for the restriction at all.

<<3849.09;3866.05;en>>
The recognition that a restriction of the right to legal advice for compelling reasons does not of itself involve a violation of article 6, involves a recognition that if such a restriction is imposed, it is still possible for the accused of a fair trial.

<<3866.05;3876.97;en>>
The government submit that once a restriction has been imposed, the question of whether the subsequent proceedings are fair depends on an evaluation of the proceedings as a whole.

<<3876.97;3882.53;en>>
This was made clear by the chamber, and again in the case of Saldo's.

<<3882.53;3889.57;en>>
In evaluating the overall fairness of the proceedings, there are a number of factors it is necessary to take into account.

<<3889.57;3893.95;en>>
And these were identified by the chamber at paragraph 196.

<<3893.95;3900.09;en>>
First, the general legislative framework and any safeguards it contains.

<<3900.09;3901.33;en>>
And we've addressed this.

<<3901.33;3905.25;en>>
Second, the quality of the evidence.

<<3905.25;3910.05;en>>
Third, whether the statement was promptly retracted.

<<3910.05;3915.21;en>>
Fourth, the procedural safeguards applied during criminal proceedings.

<<3915.21;3919.93;en>>
And fifth, the strength of the other evidence in the case.

<<3919.93;3926.53;en>>
This is an important factor, as the chamber concluded.

<<3926.53;3938.57;en>>
An analysis of the factors identified by the chamber will allow this court to consider how, in substance and in reality, the restriction impacted on the fairness of the proceedings.

<<3938.57;3952.65;en>>
It permits an evaluation that is sensitive to the wider range of factual circumstances that will arise across different cases, and also an evaluation that has regard to the specifics of the particular legal system concerned.

<<3952.65;3968.93;en>>
However, the first three applicants and the third party intervener contend that the factors identified by the chamber are irrelevant, and that the court should not consider the fairness of the proceedings by reference to the particular facts of the case, or having regard to the legal system concerned.

<<3968.93;3978.61;en>>
Instead, they contend that there should be a hard-edged, inflexible, absolute rule which prohibits the admission of a statement made in the absence of legal advice.

<<3978.61;3985.01;en>>
This is yet another so-called bright-line rule which is being urged on this court.

<<3985.01;3995.59;en>>
The government submit that the adoption of such a rule would be unprincipled, contrary to this court's traditional approach to the issue of overall fairness, and arbitrary in practice.

<<3995.59;4008.53;en>>
The content of Article VI does not mandate such a rule, and contrary to that which is submitted by the first three applicants, there is no support in this court's case law for the existence of such a rule.

<<4008.53;4012.77;en>>
The chamber judgment reflects the balance of the convention.

<<4012.77;4019.09;en>>
If the applicant's argument was accepted, it could undermine public confidence in the convention.

<<4019.09;4031.29;en>>
That is particularly so when the domestic courts and the chamber have concluded not only that the proceedings were fair, but that there were compelling reasons for the authorities to have acted as they did.

<<4031.29;4044.65;en>>
As a matter of principle, the approach of this court has been to avoid laying down inflexible rules in relation to paragraph 3 of Article VI, in particular inflexible rules in relation to the admissibility of evidence.

<<4044.65;4053.05;en>>
As this court has said on many occasions, admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts.

<<4053.05;4059.25;en>>
And this court's only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly.

<<4059.25;4065.57;en>>
And the problem with inflexible rules was expressed by the grand chamber and Al-Khawaji and United Kingdom.

<<4065.57;4075.93;en>>
But this court was considering whether there was an absolute rule that a conviction could not be based solely or to a decisive degree on hearsay evidence.

<<4075.93;4080.99;en>>
And the relevant quotation is in the written submission.

<<4080.99;4093.53;en>>
Contrary to the submissions of the first three applicants, Sarduz does not lay down a bright line rule that the admission of a statement made in the absence of legal advice inevitably involves a violation of Article VI.

<<4093.53;4108.85;en>>
At paragraph 55, the grand chamber observed the rights of the defense will, in principle, be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements major in police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction.

<<4108.85;4114.29;en>>
However, that statement of principle is not to be construed as laying down an absolute rule.

<<4114.29;4122.97;en>>
As the grand chamber noted in Sarduz at paragraph 52, the question of fairness had to be determined in light of the entirety of the proceedings.

<<4122.97;4129.73;en>>
And indeed, the court in Sarduz went on to examine other factors at paragraph 57 of the judgment.

<<4129.73;4144.05;en>>
Most significantly, this court had regard to the fact that the statements in question were the main evidence in the case and that the trial court, whilst using the statement to convict, did not take any stance on its admissibility.

<<4144.05;4153.97;en>>
Not only does Sarduz properly analyze, not lay down, the bright line rule which the applicants suggest, it has not been interpreted as laying down such a rule.

<<4153.97;4161.89;en>>
The chamber certainly did not interpret it as doing so, and nor did this grand chamber in the recent judgment in Dvorsky and Kreyschau.

<<4161.89;4186.57;en>>
With the court having cited Sarduz, noted at paragraph 82, that where a statement was admitted, relevant factors to be considered include the opportunity given to the accused to challenge the authenticity of the evidence and to oppose its use, whether the accused was in custody, whether such statements constituted a significant element on which the conviction was based, and the strength of the other evidence in the case.

<<4192.01;4197.89;en>>
And nor has the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom interpreted Sarduz in the way suggested by the applicants.

<<4197.89;4210.93;en>>
I refer there to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Her Majesty's Advocate and Pee, the case that followed on from the decision in Kader.

<<4210.93;4223.69;en>>
At paragraph 34 of the first three applicants memorial, a number of cases have been cited in support of the proposition that this court has, following Sarduz, adopted a bright line admissibility rule.

<<4223.69;4228.09;en>>
However, on analysis, the cases do not support this proposition.

<<4228.09;4237.69;en>>
In each case, a violation was found not by applying a bright line rule, that the mere admission of the statement breached the convention, but on other grounds.

<<4237.69;4246.73;en>>
For example, as I've already said, the four Turkish cases all involved a systematic denial of legal advice, which itself led to a violation.

<<4246.73;4254.05;en>>
In Plonka in Poland, the court had regard to the fact that the suspect was a vulnerable person who was not properly informed of her rights.

<<4254.05;4258.45;en>>
It was also a case, unlike the present, in which the accused had confessed.

<<4258.45;4267.81;en>>
In Pyshnokov in Russia, there was no justification at all for the denial of legal advice, and no proper consideration of the admissibility of the statement.

<<4267.81;4273.49;en>>
In Yushakov in Ukraine, the accused treatment had amounted to a violation of Article 3.

<<4273.49;4284.57;en>>
In Yurovolkov in Ukraine, another confession case, the trial court did not conduct an assessment or evaluation of allegations of coercion in connection with the making of the statement in question.

<<4284.57;4295.49;en>>
The cases all involved systematic restrictions or trial procedures which, the statements having been admitted, were not sufficient to prevent undue prejudice to the defense.

<<4295.49;4302.61;en>>
They focused on the particular circumstances of the case and the particular legal procedures that were adopted by the domestic courts.

<<4302.61;4310.65;en>>
They did not apply an inflexible rule of the kind the first three applicants are asking this court to adopt.

<<4310.65;4316.49;en>>
The third-party intervener has placed substantial reliance on the EU directive.

<<4316.49;4329.45;en>>
The government submit that the directive is an instrument that is in fact supportive of this court's existing flexible approach, focused on overall fairness, and is inconsistent with the adoption of an inflexible rule.

<<4329.45;4344.77;en>>
It is noteworthy that Article 3, paragraph 6 of the directive, permits temporary derogation from the right of access to a lawyer for compelling reasons, which entirely accord with the reasons set out in the English statutory scheme.

<<4344.77;4361.53;en>>
The government invite the court to determine the present applications by following the approach set out in this court's established case law, and in particular, by reference to the structured approach adopted by the chamber, which was based on a careful and compelling analysis of this court's jurisprudence.

<<4361.53;4369.29;en>>
The government submit that in each case, the first question is whether there were compelling reasons for the restriction on the right to legal advice.

<<4369.29;4377.93;en>>
And the second question is whether the admission of the statements caused undue prejudice, taking into account the fairness of the proceedings as a whole.

<<4377.93;4392.41;en>>
The government's overall submission on these points is that, as found by the trial judge, the court of appeal, and the chamber, there were compelling reasons for the restriction, and each of the applicants had a fair trial.

<<4392.41;4399.75;en>>
Against that background, may I now move on to the facts of the application, starting with the case of the first three applicants.

<<4399.75;4404.89;en>>
The first issue is whether there were compelling reasons.

<<4404.89;4414.61;en>>
The conclusion of the chamber was that there was no doubt that compelling reasons existed to restrict the right of the first three applicants to legal advice in their early police interviews.

<<4414.61;4429.93;en>>
The chamber found that it had been convincingly established that at the time of the interviews, there was an exceptionally serious and imminent threat to public safety, and that this threat provided the compelling reasons which justified the temporary delay of access to lawyers.

<<4429.93;4440.09;en>>
The government submit that the conclusion of the chamber was correct, and that the justification for restricting the right to access to legal advice has been clearly established.

<<4440.09;4457.01;en>>
The chamber's conclusion on this matter was based on an assessment of the circumstances in which the decisions were made, remembering that two weeks earlier, suicide bombers had killed 52 people in London, and that London was now in the midst of another suicide attack.

<<4457.01;4468.33;en>>
The individual decisions to restrict access were taken by police officers of senior rank, who, as the chamber found, had reasonable grounds for their belief that the restriction was necessary.

<<4468.33;4475.69;en>>
The grounds, which were contemporaneously recorded, were, as the chamber noted, full, compelling, and convincing.

<<4479.41;4494.33;en>>
The first three applicants at paragraph 37 of the memorial are submitting that there were no compelling reasons, and with emphasis that there was no evidence at all to support the conclusions of the chamber, excepting the case presented by the government.

<<4494.33;4500.01;en>>
The government submit that this is an extreme submission, and it is untenable.

<<4500.01;4509.49;en>>
As has been concluded at all stages, the imperative under which the police were operating at that time was obvious and was compelling.

<<4509.49;4518.77;en>>
But in addition, the first three applicants are now inviting the grand chamber to conduct a fine-grained analysis of the facts of the case, and to do two things.

<<4518.77;4528.73;en>>
First, to put itself in the place of the police on the ground, who were responsible for dealing with this emergency situation, and to second-guess the decisions they took.

<<4528.73;4540.77;en>>
And second, to overturn the factual evaluation of the trial judge, who heard the relevant evidence in the voir dire, and overturn the review of that evaluation conducted by the court of appeal.

<<4540.77;4554.89;en>>
In essence, the approach of the first three applicants in respect to this aspect of the case is to invite the grand chamber to sit as a fourth instance appeal court, and invite a conclusion that the domestic courts got the facts wrong.

<<4554.89;4561.61;en>>
The government submit that this attempt to relitigate the facts is unprincipled.

<<4561.61;4571.73;en>>
This court has asked the government to address the question of whether, if compelling reasons to justify the restrictions were not present, there was a violation of Article VI.

<<4571.73;4582.37;en>>
The government would observe, first of all, that given the facts that compelling reasons did exist in the case of the first three applicants, the issue does not arise in the facts of their case.

<<4582.37;4595.17;en>>
However, in response to the question at the level of principle, the government's submission is that the absence of compelling reasons would not, of itself, necessarily involve a violation of Article VI.

<<4595.17;4605.21;en>>
In other words, in order to determine whether there has been a violation, it is still necessary to examine the entirety of the proceedings.

<<4605.21;4611.85;en>>
The government accept there is some dicta supporting the proposition that such a rule is to be derived from Saldus.

<<4611.85;4619.13;en>>
The government accept that the absence of compelling grounds is a very important factor in the assessment of a complaint under Article VI.

<<4619.13;4629.55;en>>
A restrictor of the right to legal advice in the absence of compelling grounds is, of itself, capable of constituting a violation of Article VI, depending on the circumstances.

<<4629.55;4632.97;en>>
In some cases, it could lead to a finding of violation.

<<4632.97;4641.29;en>>
For example, whereas in the Turkish cases, there is a systematic denial of the right so that it is, in effect, extinguished on an arbitrary basis.

<<4641.29;4645.07;en>>
That is likely to constitute a violation of Article VI.

<<4645.07;4652.05;en>>
However, the government submit the absence of compelling grounds does not necessarily involve a violation.

<<4652.05;4663.33;en>>
As the case law cited by the chamber makes clear, the court has consistently stated that its primary concern under Article VI is to evaluate the overall fairness of criminal proceedings.

<<4663.33;4666.89;en>>
The right to legal advice is not an end in itself.

<<4666.89;4680.37;en>>
Compliance with the requirements of a fair trial must be examined in each case having regard to the development of the proceedings as a whole and not on the basis of the isolated consideration of one particular aspect or incident.

<<4680.37;4689.53;en>>
The importance of assessing complaints by examining the entirety of the proceedings is highlighted by examples of the positions which may arise in practice.

<<4689.53;4702.01;en>>
In England, if the accused makes a statement in circumstances where his right to legal advice is restricted in the absence of compelling grounds, the court is likely to exclude the statement pursuant to the provisions of PACE.

<<4702.01;4708.09;en>>
In many cases, the exclusion of the evidence will remedy any potential unfairness arising from the restriction.

<<4708.09;4715.29;en>>
And in this way, the trial process, viewed as a whole, will have fully vindicated the accused's rights under the convention.

<<4715.29;4720.33;en>>
Similarly, events may arise at trial which justify the admission of the statement.

<<4720.33;4729.85;en>>
For example, an accused may deliberately attempt to mislead the jury by claiming that he had, from the beginning of the investigation, given a particular account to the police.

<<4729.85;4738.97;en>>
This false claim might, depending on the circumstances, justify the admission of the otherwise excluded statement as rebuttal evidence.

<<4738.97;4759.33;en>>
In summary, the government submit that an inflexible rule that means an Article VI complaint is determined solely on the basis of an isolated consideration, without having regard to the subsequent development of the proceedings, is contrary to principle, and is likely to lead complaints being upheld when, in reality, the trial of the accused was fair.

<<4759.33;4770.13;en>>
In any event, on the basis that compelling reasons did exist in the case of the first three applicants, the second question is whether, viewed in their entirety, the proceedings were fair.

<<4770.13;4780.25;en>>
In addressing this question, the chamber conducted a detailed consideration of the proceedings as a whole, and concluded that the admission of the statements in question did not cause undue prejudice.

<<4780.25;4788.49;en>>
The government submit that the conclusion of the chamber was correct, and that the trial of the first three applicants was fair in all respects.

<<4788.49;4802.45;en>>
In summary, the government submit that the first three applicants had a fair trial, and that there is no basis for concluding that the rights of the defense were unduly or irretrievably prejudiced by the admission of the statements.

<<4802.45;4807.37;en>>
I move on now to the case of the fourth applicant.

<<4807.37;4813.25;en>>
The court has asked the government to address the significance of the failures to caution the fourth applicant.

<<4813.25;4820.63;en>>
In the case of the fourth applicant, there came a time during questioning when Code C required the police to administer a caution.

<<4820.63;4833.29;en>>
For the reasons set out by the chamber, and considered below, in the exceptional circumstances of the fourth applicant's case, there were compelling reasons for the decision of the police not to comply with this requirement.

<<4833.29;4840.71;en>>
In Sychenko, the court held that in the circumstances of that case, it had been incumbent on the police to caution the applicant.

<<4840.71;4846.61;en>>
But the decision did not lay down a general rule that a failure to caution violates Article VI.

<<4846.61;4852.01;en>>
As is obvious, a caution is only one aspect of the protection against self-incrimination.

<<4852.01;4862.37;en>>
The decision not to caution the fourth applicant did not of itself involve a violation of Article VI, and nor did it render the statement of the fourth applicant inadmissible.

<<4862.37;4874.57;en>>
In answer to the court's question, it is clear that the significance of the omission to administer a caution is that it was a matter which the trial judge had to assess when determining whether it was fair to admit the statement.

<<4874.57;4878.05;en>>
And of course, this was a matter that the judge did, in fact, take into account.

<<4880.93;4909.69;en>>
As to compelling reasons more generally, the chamber similarly concluded that there was no doubt that compelling reasons existed to restrict the right of the fourth applicant to legal advice in his early police interviews, and that it had been convincingly established that at the time of the interviews, there was an exceptionally serious and imminent threat to public safety, and that this threat provided the compelling reasons which justified the temporary delay of access to lawyers.

<<4909.69;4921.53;en>>
In the particular circumstances of the fourth applicant's case, the requirement to consider whether legal advice should be offered did not arise at first, because the fourth applicant was being questioned as a witness.

<<4921.53;4930.13;en>>
When this changed, the police took a decision not to caution the fourth applicant or advise him of his right to legal advice, as required by Code C.

<<4930.13;4938.81;en>>
However, as the chamber noted, the exceptional circumstances and the extreme conditions in which the police were operating must be borne in mind.

<<4938.81;4941.09;en>>
London was under attack.

<<4941.09;4948.97;en>>
Three bombers remained at large, and the identification and arrest of the conspirators were imperative for public safety reasons.

<<4948.97;4961.93;en>>
The police on the ground were faced with a dilemma, and the decision the police took, which was based on the need to obtain information for the purposes of protecting the public from the imminent risk of death, was not unreasonable in the circumstances.

<<4961.93;4970.89;en>>
In summary, the existence of compelling reasons was clear and obvious, and has been recognised at every stage.

<<4970.89;4983.29;en>>
In relation to overall fairness, the chamber conducted a detailed consideration of the proceedings as a whole and concluded that the admission of the statement in question did not cause undue prejudice to the fourth applicant.

<<4983.29;4991.45;en>>
The government submit that the conclusion of the chamber was correct and that the trial of the fourth applicant was fair in all respects.

<<4991.45;5004.25;en>>
In summary, the government submit that the fourth applicant had a fair trial and that there is no basis for concluding that the rights of the defence were unduly or irretrievably prejudiced by the admission of the statements.

<<5004.25;5006.73;en>>
Mr. President, in conclusion, the government

<<5006.73;5015.97;en>>
of the United Kingdom invite the court to hold in the case of each applicant that there was no violation of Article 6 of the Convention.

<<5015.97;5015.97;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5017.45;5025.57;en>>
Thank you very much Lord Keen and thank you to all for your interventions.

<<5025.57;5034.43;en>>
I would now like to invite the judges of the Grand Chamber to put any questions they may have to the parties.

<<5034.43;5035.43;en>>
Judge Motoc, please.

<<5035.43;5035.43;en>>
Thank you.

[[Judge;Iulia Antoanella Motoc]]

<<5038.31;5040.75;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<5040.75;5043.35;en>>
My first question goes to the applicant.

<<5043.35;5063.19;en>>
And I would like to ask you, in the light of what you had said at the beginning, how you take into account the recent resolution of the Security Council, 2249, adopted recently, a few days ago, which considers, again, that terrorism is a threat to the peace and security.

<<5063.19;5068.55;en>>
And this is not the first time that the Security Councils have qualified terrorism as such.

<<5068.55;5083.27;en>>
How you take into account this resolution of the Security Council in relation with Article 103 of the Charter of the UN and in relation with Article 6 in our convention as such?

<<5083.27;5086.95;en>>
My second question is also to the applicant.

<<5086.95;5089.87;en>>
And I would like to see, because you have invoked the U.N.

<<5089.87;5115.03;en>>
Directive, I would like to have your interpretation of you about the Article 12 of this directive, which, now, it's not very clear for a lot of the doctrine, and especially to the reference in the Article 12 to the Article 3, Paragraph 6 of this directive.

<<5115.03;5120.75;en>>
My third question, it's addressed to the government of the UK.

<<5120.75;5152.83;en>>
And I would like the government of the UK to comment in the Paragraph 39 of the Supreme Court of Judication, Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, which said, in this type of cases, the court is only likely to conclude that there have been an abusive process if a defendant can establish that there have been an unequivocal representation of those responsible for the conduct of the prosecution and the defendant has acted in this statement.

<<5152.83;5165.37;en>>
And I would like to see what means for this court to be unequivocal, where he was not aware that he became a suspect because he was called to be a witness.

<<5165.37;5165.37;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5167.07;5168.15;en>>
Thank you very much. Judge Spano please.

[[Judge;Robert Spano]]

<<5171.09;5172.61;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<5172.61;5183.79;en>>
I have one question for the Council for the first three applicants, and then two questions for the government that have been provoked by the pleadings here today.

<<5183.79;5202.17;en>>
I noticed that in the pleadings of the Council for the first three applicants, there was no direct pleadings or reference to whether compelling reasons existed for restricting the first three applicants' rights to legal advice.

<<5202.17;5225.09;en>>
Do I understand it to be the case that the Council stipulates that there were compelling reasons to restrict advice of the first three applicants, or is it the contention of the Council that it really doesn't matter for the legal assessment whether compelling reasons existed or not, as an overall fairness assessment needs to be considered?

<<5225.09;5227.39;en>>
Or does it need to be conducted anyways?

<<5227.39;5231.13;en>>
Could I just get a clarification from the Council on that issue?

<<5231.13;5269.03;en>>
And may I, as the Council referred to international legal instruments and the EU position, may I ask Council to take into account in their answer Article 3 of the directive just mentioned by Judge Motok, the directive of 2013 of the right of access to a lawyer, where in Article 3 there is an explicit exception provided to the right of access to a lawyer when the government, the police, are confronted with adverse consequences or an urgent need to protect life and liberty?

<<5271.37;5277.71;en>>
To the government, may I firstly ask a clarification on a factual issue?

<<5277.71;5297.43;en>>
There is a distinction in the facts as regards the way in which the decision was taken in restricting legal advice of the first three applicants, in the sense that that decision in all the first three applicants' cases was explicitly reasoned and recorded.

<<5297.43;5305.17;en>>
So we have information in the file on the actual thinking behind the decision to restrict legal advice.

<<5305.17;5314.45;en>>
However, in the fourth applicant's case, there is no such recording or reasoning given at the time when the decision was taken.

<<5314.45;5326.53;en>>
May I ask, was the fact that this decision was not recorded or reasoned, is that an anomaly under UK criminal procedural law or guidelines or codes?

<<5326.53;5337.63;en>>
And if this is not an anomaly, is there a basis for an exceptions to recording or reasoning for procedural decisions of that nature?

<<5337.63;5340.97;en>>
The second question is a linked question.

<<5340.97;5360.07;en>>
I understand the government to rely heavily on the fact that under domestic law, Schedule 8 of the Terrorism Act, there is an explicit statutory regime regulating when restrictions on legal advice can take place.

<<5360.07;5366.67;en>>
Now, in the fourth applicant's case, as I understand it, there was an explicit decision taken not to caution.

<<5366.67;5401.01;en>>
Is it the government's contention that the superintendent who decided, who made that decision at that moment, also in the individual circumstances, made an assessment on whether the conditions under Schedule 8 for restricting legal advice, not just the breach of the code on the right to remain silent, but he also made a determination which the government has emphasized is part of the assessment of compelling reasons, also made a determination under Schedule 8 of the Terrorism Act.

<<5401.01;5407.35;en>>
And the reason I ask is because we do not have any record or reasoning given for that decision.

<<5407.35;5407.35;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5408.99;5410.91;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge Spano.

<<5410.91;5412.87;en>>
Now Vice President Judge Sajó, please.

[[Judge;András Sajó]]

<<5415.81;5418.69;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<5418.69;5427.93;en>>
My questions are addressed primarily to the government, but the applicants' lawyers are free to comment if they wish so.

<<5432.09;5437.45;en>>
I had a difficulty following your argument, so this is just for clarification.

<<5437.45;5459.85;en>>
Is it the position of the government that the compelling reasons are to be determined at the level of domestic proceedings, or is it within the power of this court to analyze compelling reasons?

<<5459.85;5468.09;en>>
Or would it be, in your view, an act of force instance?

<<5468.09;5481.29;en>>
Related to this, and I apologize for asking this, but I was forced by arguments made by applicants.

<<5481.29;5505.97;en>>
In paragraph 38 of the applicants, Ibrahim and others' observations to the court, there is a discussion of the presence or availability of lawyers before and during the safety interview.

<<5510.25;5520.81;en>>
If I understand you correctly, your argument is that this situation was extraordinary, and I think no one can doubt that.

<<5520.81;5537.05;en>>
But then you also mentioned that it is obvious why these interviews were taken in the absence of lawyers who were, at least in some cases, available.

<<5537.05;5542.69;en>>
And sometimes even the obvious needs some explanation.

<<5542.69;5566.05;en>>
So I would be very grateful if you were kind enough to explain what is the interest that necessitates the absence of lawyers in those circumstances and in the particular circumstances of this case.

<<5566.05;5575.01;en>>
My second question is related to a case, and I apologize if my pronunciation is not correct.

<<5575.01;5579.85;en>>
Maggie, or Maggie, this is a case we decided in 2000.

<<5579.85;5583.37;en>>
This is a Northern Ireland terrorist case.

<<5583.37;5589.25;en>>
The facts, as far as I can see, are comparable.

<<5589.25;5610.89;en>>
There, one of the reasons for finding a violation was that holding the applicant incommunicado for around 48 hours in appalling conditions amounted to coercion.

<<5610.89;5620.65;en>>
Now, I wonder whether you would like to distinguish the present situation from that one, and if so, on which ground.

<<5620.65;5628.77;en>>
I understand that the period is shorter, but these facts were not presented by you so far.

<<5628.77;5643.05;en>>
In regard to Maggie, finally, and obviously related to Maggie, there was no discussion of the problem of self-incrimination.

<<5643.05;5648.81;en>>
And related to it, the problem of remaining silent.

<<5648.81;5652.81;en>>
I would like to know the position of the government.

<<5652.81;5659.93;en>>
What is the place of the rule against self-incrimination in the convention?

<<5659.93;5663.33;en>>
Do you consider this to be, because it's not there.

<<5663.33;5694.12;en>>
And there was argument recently in this auditorium, if I may call this chamber an auditorium, where it was argued that the absence of certain words which are in the Universal Declaration and in the covenant being absent from the convention mean that there is an intention not to include it.

<<5694.12;5701.65;en>>
And we know that these considerations, self-incrimination, et cetera, are not in the text.

<<5701.65;5711.97;en>>
So what is the place of those principles or rules according to the government from the perspective of Article VI?

<<5711.97;5711.97;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5713.02;5715.18;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge Sajó.

<<5715.18;5716.18;en>>
Judge Lemmens, please.

[[Judge;Paul Lemmens]]

<<5719.24;5722.12;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<5722.12;5736.52;en>>
I would like to ask both parties whether they can assist the court in the interpretation of the famous paragraph 55 of the Saldus judgment.

<<5736.52;5755.16;en>>
It is said there that even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction, whatever its justification, must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6.

<<5755.16;5776.85;en>>
And then the next sentence reads, the rights of the defense will in principle, and I stress in principle, be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction.

<<5776.85;5784.05;en>>
This seems to suggest that apart from the principle, there is also an exception.

<<5784.05;5795.73;en>>
I would like to ask whether the applicants agree with this part of the Saldus principles, including the in principle term.

<<5795.73;5805.81;en>>
I know from the government that they agree with the fact that there is a principle and therefore also an exception, so I'm not going to ask them the question.

<<5805.81;5812.36;en>>
But then I would like to ask both parties whether they can give examples.

<<5812.36;5829.01;en>>
In the first place, and that would then be especially for the applicants, what could be exceptions where the use of statements made without the assistance of a lawyer would not violate the overall fairness?

<<5829.01;5831.01;en>>
But the government can reply to that too.

<<5831.01;5850.93;en>>
And then vice versa, especially for the government, but the applicants can also give an answer, when would such use violate the overall fairness, also taking into account that according to Saldus, this is what usually as a matter of principle would happen.

<<5850.93;5864.44;en>>
So I'm asking for some clear examples because a lot has been said, but it's for me not clear how you look at the application of this last part of the Saldus principles in practice.

<<5864.44;5864.44;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5865.15;5867.19;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge Lemmens.

<<5867.19;5869.19;en>>
And now, President of Section, Judge López Guerra, please.

[[Judge;Luis López Guerra]]

<<5872.3;5873.14;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<5873.14;5875.96;en>>
Just a brief question to the government.

<<5875.96;5887.34;en>>
As I understand, the three first applicants were cautious about their rights in several ways, but there was a caution given to them.

<<5887.34;5891.26;en>>
However, the fourth applicant was not cautious.

<<5891.72;5894.4;en>>
I mean, no warning was given to him.

<<5894.4;5905.34;en>>
Now, the question is, well, the government seems to maintain that there were compelling reasons for not cautioning the fourth applicant.

<<5905.64;5918.74;en>>
However, I would like to some explanation why the government considered there were not compelling reasons for not cautioning the three first one, but there were compelling reasons for not cautioning the fourth one.

<<5918.74;5925.14;en>>
What was the difference between the three first applicant and the fourth applicant in this respect?

<<5925.14;5925.14;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5925.82;5929.34;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge López Guerra.

<<5929.98;5933.98;en>>
Now the court will rise for some minutes.

<<5934.54;5950.54;en>>
We can resume at 11.15, following which the parties will return for a second round of short pleadings to respond to submissions in the first round and to the questions raised by the judges.

[[Announcer;UNK]]

<<6027.37;6028.05;fr>>
La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<6069.29;6070.89;en>>
Please be seated.

<<6073.61;6077.81;en>>
The hearing is now resumed, and I call Mr. Bennathan.

<<6077.81;6079.69;en>>
Mr. Bennathan, please, you have the floor.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<6079.69;6079.71;en>>
Thank you.

<<6079.75;6081.31;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<6081.31;6083.21;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<6083.21;6089.65;en>>
Can we start with addressing Judge Sarger, the Vice President's question?

<<6089.65;6098.71;en>>
In a word, in a sentence at least, self-incrimination we say clearly is now implicit, read into Article 6 by a series of cases.

<<6098.71;6130.51;en>>
And as we deal with the difference between self-incrimination and other circumstances, and as the trial judge touched upon it as well in the applicant's case, would make this submission in passing, it cannot be right, we would say, that there are different sets of rules depending whether the unrepresented person being interviewed makes a self-incriminating comment, whether they tell lies, whether they remain silent, or whether they speak but fail to set out the basis of their later defense.

<<6130.51;6142.67;en>>
This is already, with great respect, a complicated area to have four sets of rules, depending how you analyze the answers, would be a hopeless complication to introduce further.

<<6142.67;6154.35;en>>
The European Charter, it is true, of course, that 3.6 of the Charter has a derogation,

<<6154.35;6162.41;en>>
perhaps more tightly drawn, to the absolute right, the otherwise absolute right to have a lawyer present at interview.

<<6162.41;6164.97;en>>
Of course, that's correct.

<<6164.97;6168.07;en>>
Salders gets to the same place.

<<6168.07;6169.65;en>>
Forgive me, that's a very clumsy phrase.

<<6169.65;6173.65;en>>
Salders is not perhaps so strictly contained, but it has the same effect.

<<6173.65;6175.07;en>>
Normally there will be a lawyer.

<<6175.07;6181.51;en>>
There may be circumstances when there may not be, albeit Salders doesn't require a formal derogation.

<<6181.51;6186.85;en>>
But the European Charter is silent as to what happens next.

<<6186.85;6192.47;en>>
If one gets outwith the normal central right of representation, what happens next?

<<6192.47;6200.55;en>>
And we say the second half of paragraph 55 in Salders, to which I will turn in but a moment or two, gives the answer.

<<6200.55;6204.05;en>>
And we say that answer is there is a principled position.

<<6204.05;6210.71;en>>
No lawyer at interview, even if that is justified, the fruits of that interview should not be at trial.

<<6210.71;6214.85;en>>
And before leaving the European Charter, I would make this point.

<<6214.85;6223.67;en>>
The reason given for all the occasions when there can be a derogation and interview without lawyer are not gathering evidence in urgent cases.

<<6223.67;6227.35;en>>
They are the protection of life and limb and the avoidance of danger.

<<6227.35;6248.35;en>>
So as with the position in the United Kingdom, the justification for forcing an interview without a lawyer is not to gather evidence, but now in this case the United Kingdom are arguing having been allowed to breach the normal rule, they may now take advantage of that breach, albeit that wasn't the reason they were allowed to avoid the normal rule to start with.

<<6248.35;6258.17;en>>
Judge Spano asks us, and we quite understand why the question is asked, whether we abandon the position of saying there was compelling, there was no compelling reason.

<<6258.17;6264.45;en>>
May I avoid the judge's question like this, it will seem, by saying firstly, you have our written submissions.

<<6264.45;6276.47;en>>
Secondly, we say this court can revisit the question of whether the trial court or the domestic appellate court was right or wrong to make those factual rulings.

<<6276.47;6286.05;en>>
And there are numerous examples of this court and section courts of this, of the European court, going behind the findings of courts.

<<6286.05;6288.15;en>>
We would simply pose this question.

<<6288.15;6304.65;en>>
Given in some of these safety interviews there were lawyers in the police station, there were lawyers in the police station which is in central London, waiting, asking to be admitted, where really was the harm in having a lawyer there when the safety interview is then conducted?

<<6304.65;6317.47;en>>
But as the court has noticed, and as Judge Spano obviously notices, the main thrust of our argument today has been, even if the court concludes there were compelling reasons, what should happen next?

<<6317.47;6339.81;en>>
And with great respect, the results of the decision the Grand Chamber reaches in due course will be a historical footnote, an anomaly on the certain circumstances in July 2005 in London, but they will have a lasting resonance and importance on what happens henceforth throughout member states with the fruit of unrepresented interviews.

<<6339.81;6347.17;en>>
And that is why it seems to us, with great respect, that should be the central thrust, the central point of the submissions we make today.

<<6347.17;6356.95;en>>
The case of Magee, the question was not directed at us in particular, but in passing we do note Magee, a Northern Irish terrorist case, of course.

<<6356.95;6362.95;en>>
The court found a violation from the denial of access to a lawyer in excess of 48 hours.

<<6362.95;6372.01;en>>
The court, this court, acted on the factual basis found by the trial court, no ill treatment, and the confessions were voluntary.

<<6372.01;6390.91;en>>
In Magee, the United Kingdom argued exactly as the United Kingdom argues today, namely that the rights were adequately protected at trial because there were lawyers, there was elaborate argument, there was a long ruling by the judge allowing the fruit of Magee's detention, the fruit of his confession in.

<<6390.91;6406.71;en>>
And the court found a violation because, with respect, the court always has to be able to look behind the elaboration, the words, the layers of procedure to get to the substance if practical and effective rights are to be guaranteed.

<<6406.71;6421.01;en>>
The United Nations Resolution 2249 of 2015, we accept this is a difficult time for anyone to be talking about terrorism and the rights of those accused of terrorist offenses.

<<6421.01;6433.71;en>>
But we do note nowhere in Resolution 2249 does it speak of Article 103, the fair trial right, of course, being in any way touched or affected by that resolution.

<<6433.71;6442.17;en>>
Indeed, paragraph 5 of the resolution says member states have to take all measures, quote, in compliance with international law.

<<6442.17;6451.47;en>>
And we will say the effect of that, with great respect, is that fair trials must survive even the most difficult of times.

<<6451.47;6460.47;en>>
The government, in their submissions of my learned friend, Lord Keane, suggested that to have a bright line rule is, quote, unprincipled.

<<6460.47;6466.17;en>>
Well, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has a bright line rule.

<<6466.17;6469.91;en>>
The United States of America has a bright line rule.

<<6469.91;6477.17;en>>
So that is perhaps the majority of the planet, one way or another, lives within bright line rules in this area of the law.

<<6477.17;6479.71;en>>
So are they really also unprincipled?

<<6479.71;6482.67;en>>
Or is it perhaps more sensibly expressed?

<<6482.67;6483.67;en>>
There is a principle.

<<6483.67;6488.87;en>>
The United Kingdom don't like it, a rather different proposition.

<<6488.87;6494.77;en>>
Second part of Sowler's paragraph 55, what does in principle mean?

<<6494.77;6498.07;en>>
Mr. President, we say that the Grand Chamber has a simple

<<6498.07;6499.07;en>>
choice here.

<<6499.07;6515.83;en>>
It can either interpret in principle as saying it's a principle that matters and must be observed, or it can use it to water down the second part of paragraph 55 and say it's a general principle that can be avoided, really, on many, many occasions.

<<6515.83;6517.47;en>>
We suggest it should be the former.

<<6517.47;6525.67;en>>
We suggest in principle should mean this is a principle being laid down by this court for member states to follow to protect important rights.

<<6525.67;6532.27;en>>
And therefore, we have no examples to offer of occasions when that protection should be avoided.

<<6532.27;6534.33;en>>
My last two points are these.

<<6534.33;6553.57;en>>
It was suggested by my learned friends for the fourth applicant and perhaps with respect within Judge Motok's question that in times of terror, we somehow stop affording human rights to those accused of serious offenses, those accused of terrorist offenses.

<<6553.57;6575.03;en>>
We would say with great respect, unfashionable and unpopular, though it may be to mount these arguments, actually, in times of stress, in times of terror, it is exactly when those of us who are concerned with human rights with great respect should be most on our guard to make sure those human rights are protected.

<<6575.03;6580.13;en>>
Salda's was a case linked to the PKK, a vast loss of life in Turkey.

<<6580.13;6581.59;en>>
McGee was a terrorist case.

<<6581.59;6589.57;en>>
And Ushakov and Ushakov in Ukraine, the court stressed, these principles are particularly called for in the case of serious charges.

<<6589.57;6591.57;en>>
But herein with respect lies the balance.

<<6591.57;6593.27;en>>
Herein lies the balance.

<<6593.27;6602.17;en>>
The stress and the urgency of their moment is highly relevant to where there is a compelling reason to have the interview without lawyers in the first place.

<<6602.17;6609.53;en>>
But the safety of the nation is simply not guaranteed by having an unfair trial six, 12, 18 months down the line.

<<6609.53;6618.27;en>>
There, we say, is the place in the balance that the stresses of awful current events can play a part.

<<6618.27;6634.73;en>>
Finally, our central submission is the approach of the fourth section is profoundly dangerous in adopting what we say is a novel test, namely if there is lots of other evidence, the weight of the other evidence, then breaches of articles don't matter.

<<6634.73;6637.99;en>>
Indeed, they don't even, they haven't even occurred.

<<6637.99;6649.17;en>>
In his lucid submissions to you, my lone friend Lord Keane spoke of the impugned interviews in this case of being, quote, not the central platform.

<<6649.17;6651.63;en>>
So the fourth section say there was lots of evidence.

<<6651.63;6655.19;en>>
The United Kingdom say they weren't the central platform.

<<6655.19;6659.33;en>>
The trial judge said the evidence was of, quote, high relevance.

<<6659.33;6666.63;en>>
The court of appeal say if they were admitted, they were sufficient on their own to utterly undermine the defense.

<<6666.63;6683.53;en>>
Where is the principle, where is the practical, effective guarding of the human rights guaranteed under the convention if we have these varying tests that will be adjudged by different judges and different appellate courts throughout the member states on different levels?

<<6683.53;6692.53;en>>
It must be, we say, it must be that the effective and practical guarantee of rights demands simple, clear rules.

<<6692.53;6706.53;en>>
And those simple, clear rules are the bright line rule, and those simple, clear rules are the principle set out in the latter half of paragraph 55 of Solders, and we say it is as simple as no lawyers in interview, no subsequent use of the fruits of that interview.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<6710.94;6713.55;en>>
Thank you very much Mr. Bennathan.

<<6713.55;6714.55;en>>
I call Mr. King, please.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<6714.56;6722.84;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President. The government's approach seems to have been that they don't

<<6722.84;6732.04;en>>
want anything too hard edged, was the expression that was used. Now, what they seem to want,

<<6732.04;6746.92;en>>
and certainly what seemed to occur in the case of the fourth applicant, was it certainly wasn't hard edged. If anything, it was complete jelly. Nothing, none of his rights were in

<<6746.92;6759.42;en>>
fact applied. He was not even offered a safety interview. He was not made aware that he was

<<6759.42;6767.4;en>>
a suspect by giving a caution, even in the absence of a lawyer. They continued for a

<<6767.4;6785.6;en>>
ten hour stage to interview him without a lawyer, and in effect, leading him to believe he was being interviewed as a witness. Now, clearly, the saldest point in which one grapples

<<6785.6;6799.92;en>>
with when there can be exceptions or when a confession can be admissible, there are circumstances when that does happen. For example, in a properly controlled and properly staged

<<6799.92;6812.92;en>>
interview with lawyers present and tape recording and all the rest of it, people sometimes do make a confession. They say, yes, I did that. Now, that clearly would be potentially an

<<6812.92;6820.24;en>>
admissible piece of evidence at a trial. There are other less clear cases, and it is a difficult

<<6820.24;6839.52;en>>
area where people, maybe in a casual conversation with a police officer or someone else, make a confession to an offence where there has been no pressure on them or no circumstances that make it iffy. Again, that can be admissible and has been fairly admissible.

<<6839.52;6857.4;en>>
But certainly, to have some degree of control over the process, there must be rules which, in general terms, the police and the state have to abide by. There has to be some level

<<6857.4;6874.72;en>>
of bite to the system, where they cannot just ride roughshod over every right that a suspect or a person who is suspected of a crime has. If that were the case, even in the most compelling

<<6874.72;6905.72;en>>
of circumstances—and I do not suggest that there cannot be circumstances when there are compelling reasons why it might be important for a lawyer to move ahead and get some information—having done that and having ridden roughshod over the suspects' rights, does it become right then to prosecute them? That is the problem. Can you then prosecute and use that information

<<6905.72;6919.4;en>>
where you have abused the rights of a person to obtain the information and he has made a confession? Does it ever become right then to prosecute that person based on that?

<<6919.4;6950.44;en>>
That principle is established in §52, where the court considers that in the circumstances of the case it was incumbent on the police to inform the applicant of the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to remain silent. That principle has been very carefully

<<6950.44;6961.76;en>>
guarded within the European tradition—the right against self-incrimination—because of abuses that have taken place historically. That is a right that no doubt this court will

<<6961.76;6977.0;en>>
want to uphold. To allow any form of Government-backed initiatives that deny the rights, either by

<<6977.0;6983.68;en>>
trickery or by deceit, as we say happened in this case, must not be allowed. There must

<<6983.68;6995.72;en>>
be a hard edge to that. It cannot be jelly. We realise that the court is grappling with

<<6995.72;7012.4;en>>
very difficult circumstances where there may be compelling reasons to deny fundamental rights. That has to be balanced against a complete derogation of all rights in any circumstances

<<7012.4;7021.8;en>>
without having some procedural processes whereby there is some degree of protection. Even recording,

<<7021.8;7028.2;en>>
as one of the judges mentioned, was not done in the case of the process. The process was

<<7028.2;7045.5;en>>
not even recorded. What was the thinking and any kind of attempt to deal with the processes

<<7045.5;7053.4;en>>
that were in place? It was not thought about. There seemed to be panic, if anything. That

<<7053.4;7065.74;en>>
is not an appropriate circumstance to allow a confession to be admitted against a person in his final prosecution.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<7069.18;7071.46;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. King.

<<7071.46;7072.46;en>>
Now, Lord Keen, please.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<7075.68;7077.92;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<7077.92;7084.8;en>>
Could I address the questions more or less in the order in which they were posed?

<<7084.8;7096.24;en>>
First of all, Judge Motok raised the question of abuse of process and its place in the present context.

<<7096.24;7112.44;en>>
The chamber dealt with the question of abuse of process in its judgment at paragraphs 122 to 123, and more particularly at paragraph 129, where it referred to the Court of Appeals judgment at paragraph 39.

<<7112.44;7113.68;en>>
The short point is this.

<<7113.68;7118.88;en>>
If there had been an abuse of process, that would have stayed the proceedings.

<<7118.88;7125.06;en>>
They would never have proceeded as far as a voir dire over the admissibility of the evidence at all.

<<7125.06;7127.28;en>>
But that was not this case.

<<7127.28;7130.76;en>>
It was determined that there had been no abuse of process.

<<7130.76;7140.92;en>>
Such an abuse could have arisen where, for example, some inducement had been given to one of the applicants to give evidence or to make a statement against interest.

<<7140.92;7144.92;en>>
But that was not, as I say, this case.

<<7144.92;7148.48;en>>
Could I turn to Judge Spano's questions?

<<7148.48;7154.26;en>>
And he draws the distinction between the first, second, and third applicants on the one hand, and the fourth on the other.

<<7154.26;7159.32;en>>
As a matter of principle, we submit that the cases can and should be dealt with together.

<<7159.32;7165.96;en>>
But I would acknowledge that in the case of the fourth applicant, there was a factual distinction.

<<7165.96;7171.48;en>>
Because, of course, he was originally interviewed as a witness, not as a suspect.

<<7171.48;7179.92;en>>
And for that reason, the procedures pursuant to Pace were not carried out in the first instance.

<<7179.92;7187.56;en>>
However, there came a point in time when the police became concerned that he would or was incriminating himself.

<<7187.56;7190.36;en>>
And the question of caution arose.

<<7190.36;7201.64;en>>
And a decision was made not to administer that caution in order to seek further information about the danger of the further bomb cases.

<<7201.64;7210.08;en>>
I accept that at that point, there should have been a contemporaneous record made in respect of the fourth applicant.

<<7210.08;7212.32;en>>
And it wasn't made.

<<7212.32;7221.64;en>>
What I would say is that the police officers who were engaged in that process did then give evidence in the voir dire as to the circumstances.

<<7221.64;7227.0;en>>
And that evidence was before the court when it came to its final determination.

<<7227.0;7231.44;en>>
But I accept that there was, I think the term used was an anomaly.

<<7231.44;7233.6;en>>
There was, in that sense, an anomaly.

<<7233.6;7241.0;en>>
Because there should have been a contemporaneous written record when the caution was not administered, explaining why it had not been administered.

<<7241.0;7242.88;en>>
And that was not done.

<<7242.88;7248.08;en>>
But that, in and of itself, we would submit, does not constitute a breach of Article VI.

<<7248.08;7256.6;en>>
It goes to an evaluation of the overall fairness of the admissibility of the relevant evidence.

<<7256.6;7264.76;en>>
If I can then turn to the questions from the Vice President, Judge Sladio.

<<7264.76;7278.0;en>>
He raised the question as to who should determine whether or not there existed compelling reasons for proceeding as was done.

<<7278.0;7286.48;en>>
It is, of course, in the first instance for the domestic court or courts to make that determination.

<<7286.48;7292.76;en>>
That is not to say that this court has no place in respect to that matter.

<<7292.76;7299.12;en>>
This court should respect the decision made by the domestic courts.

<<7299.12;7306.76;en>>
And it should only seek to interfere where it considers that the decision of the domestic court was clearly erroneous or wrong.

<<7309.76;7318.24;en>>
It is not for this court, in my respectful submission, to embark upon a fact-finding exercise that supersedes that of the domestic tribunal.

<<7320.96;7330.52;en>>
The second matter raised by the Vice President concerned the point about the availability of lawyers at the time of the safety interviews.

<<7330.52;7335.0;en>>
That point was addressed by the chamber at paragraph 200 of their judgment.

<<7335.0;7338.68;en>>
But the point was shortly put in this way.

<<7338.68;7345.12;en>>
There was a risk of the leak of information into the public domain if those lawyers were present.

<<7345.12;7353.84;en>>
And it is not because, as a dissenting judgment in the chamber suggested, that the lawyers were being breached of their professional obligations.

<<7353.84;7364.44;en>>
The mere fact that the judges had attended upon one of the applicants and reported back to their office where they had been would be sufficient to allow a leak into the public domain that Mr. Omar or one

<<7364.44;7374.56;en>>
of the other applicants was being held at Paddington Station in the context of the outrages that had occurred in London at that point in time.

<<7374.56;7377.96;en>>
There are any number of examples of how that could have occurred.

<<7377.96;7383.44;en>>
And it's certainly not dependent upon any lawyer being in breach of his professional obligations.

<<7383.44;7392.2;en>>
It's a mere fact that he would, for example, return to his office and explain where he had been or what he'd been doing for the past three, four, or five hours.

<<7392.2;7406.76;en>>
And that is why, although at least in one instance there was a lawyer available at the point when a safety interview was being carried out, they were not admitted to the safety interview.

<<7406.76;7413.84;en>>
The vice president also raised the question about Magee, the Northern Ireland case.

<<7413.84;7420.72;en>>
Magee was a case where there was coercion and complaints of ill treatment.

<<7420.72;7437.56;en>>
And this court held that there had clearly been coercion in the context of the applicant having been held for a period of about 48 hours during which ill treatment had been administered and a statement had been given.

<<7437.56;7442.72;en>>
That, in my respectful submission, is not this case at all.

<<7442.72;7454.92;en>>
Indeed, it is noticeable that in the case of the first three applicants, the statements made were exculpatory and in no sense, on the face of it, incriminatory.

<<7454.92;7459.32;en>>
The vice president also raises the matter of self-incrimination.

<<7459.32;7466.4;en>>
And of course, self-incrimination and guarding against self-incrimination does have a central role in the context of Article VI.

<<7466.4;7468.04;en>>
No one would dispute that.

<<7468.04;7473.16;en>>
I allude to the decision in the case of Saunders and the United Kingdom.

<<7473.16;7482.72;en>>
But as distinct from Saunders in the present case, there was no compulsion in this case with regard to the statements being given.

<<7482.72;7489.36;en>>
And therefore, I would submit that the issue of self-incrimination does not directly arise.

<<7491.92;7517.12;en>>
Could I turn then to Judge Lemons, who raised a question about the interpretation of paragraph 55 of Saldus, essentially for malignant friends, but invited examples to be given of where exceptions would not violate fairness and when it would violate overall fairness.

<<7517.12;7521.64;en>>
And of course, it's a fact-sensitive exercise.

<<7521.64;7541.36;en>>
But one can see that, for example, where you were dealing with an applicant who was a juvenile or a vulnerable person who made a confession that was later retracted, there could be a situation in which it would violate overall fairness for such a statement to be admitted when it had been given in the absence of legal advice.

<<7541.36;7552.2;en>>
But I seek to give only one example, because it is essentially a fact-sensitive exercise in my submission.

<<7552.2;7562.6;en>>
Can I turn then to Judge Guerra and the question he posed with regard to the fourth applicant.

<<7562.6;7569.0;en>>
And it is correct to say that no caution was given in the case of the fourth applicant.

<<7569.0;7572.52;en>>
But the factual matrix was different in the case of the fourth applicant.

<<7572.52;7580.64;en>>
The fourth applicant was invited in to give a statement as a witness and did give a statement as a witness.

<<7580.64;7589.04;en>>
During the course of that statement, the police became concerned that he was or was about to, in some sense, incriminate himself.

<<7589.04;7599.56;en>>
And then a decision was given pursuant to the situation on the ground and the need for further intelligence that a caution would not be administered.

<<7599.56;7608.84;en>>
And there were compelling reasons for that, as was found by the court at first instance, acknowledged by the Court of Appeal, and found by the chamber.

<<7608.84;7619.76;en>>
And at the end of the day, it is also to be noted that the fourth applicant, once he had legal advice, adopted the statement he'd already given.

<<7619.76;7623.56;en>>
Albeit he made one or two corrections, he adopted that statement.

<<7623.56;7627.4;en>>
And indeed, his position remained that he had given such a statement.

<<7627.4;7633.0;en>>
And he ultimately relied upon that in the context of mitigation and sentence.

<<7633.0;7636.2;en>>
So again, it is a fact-sensitive exercise.

<<7636.2;7637.72;en>>
I accept no caution was given.

<<7637.72;7646.32;en>>
But in the first instance, there was no grounds for giving a caution to the fourth applicant, because he began his interview with the police as a witness.

<<7646.32;7652.64;en>>
And it was only as he disclosed further material that the police became concerned about his position.

<<7652.64;7672.44;en>>
And as I observed earlier in the context of the question from Judge Spano, although there should have been a contemporary record of why the caution was not given, in the event, the police officers who were engaged in that process did give evidence in the voir dire and were cross-examined about the circumstances.

<<7678.76;7682.28;en>>
One final point.

<<7682.28;7695.96;en>>
My learned friends suggested that the fourth section, the chamber, had somehow proceeded upon the basis that breaches of Article 6 did not matter, because there were compelling reasons.

<<7695.96;7699.6;en>>
That, in my respectful submission, was not the reasoning of the chamber.

<<7699.6;7707.2;en>>
The reasoning of the chamber was that there were no breaches of Article 6, having regard to the whole circumstances that pertained.

<<7707.2;7709.6;en>>
And that is materially different.

<<7709.6;7715.44;en>>
I again invite this court to find that there were no breaches of Article 6.

<<7715.44;7720.0;en>>
Unless there's any further matter upon which I can assist the court, I would rest my submission there.

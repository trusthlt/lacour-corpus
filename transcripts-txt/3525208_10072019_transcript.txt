La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Angelika Nußberger]]

<<50.03;50.87;en>>
Please be seated.

<<59.71;69.63;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the admissibility and the merits in the case of Zentrum for Red Visa versus Sweden.

<<69.63;82.83;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on 14th of July, 2008, under article 34 of the convention by Zentrum for Red Visa, a foundation which has its seat in Sweden.

<<82.83;91.59;en>>
The application was allocated to the third section of the court pursuant to rule 52, paragraph 1 of the rules of court.

<<91.59;100.91;en>>
The application was communicated to the government on 1st of November, 2011 and 14th of October, 2014.

<<100.91;109.31;en>>
On 19th June, 2018, a chain of the third section declared it admissible and adopted a judgment on the merits.

<<109.31;120.35;en>>
On 19th of September, 2018, the applicant requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with article 43 of the convention.

<<120.35;126.95;en>>
And the panel of the Grand Chamber accepted the request on 4th of February, 2019.

<<126.95;144.47;en>>
On 9th of May, 2019, the president of the Grand Chamber granted leave to the governments of Estonia, France, the Netherlands, and Norway to submit written comments at third parties by virtue of rule 44, paragraph 3 of the rules of court.

<<144.47;159.03;en>>
The government are represented by their agent, Miss Elinor Hammarskjöld, Director General for Legal Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as by the following persons as advisors.

<<159.03;164.03;en>>
Mrs. Gunilla Isaksson and Mrs. Jessica Sjöstrand

<<164.03;168.59;en>>
of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Jan Garton and Mr. Mikael

<<168.59;175.11;en>>
Andersson of the Ministry of Defense, Mr. Håkan Sellman of the Ministry of Justice,

<<175.11;179.75;en>>
Mrs. Felisa Krzyzanski of the Ministry of Infrastructure,

<<179.75;183.95;en>>
Mrs. Michaela Dráb and Mr. Christer  Hellsten

<<183.95;187.11;en>>
of the National Defense Radio Establishment.

<<187.11;190.83;en>>
The applicant is represented by Mr. Fredrik Bergman

<<190.83;195.35;en>>
and Mrs. Angela Evans, counsel, and by Mr. Alexander Ottosson

<<195.35;198.55;en>>
and Mrs. Emilia Palm, advisors.

<<198.55;202.55;en>>
I welcome the representatives in the name of the court.

<<202.55;211.67;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and the representatives of the applicant, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<211.67;214.59;en>>
Mrs. Evans will speak first for the applicant,

<<214.59;218.27;en>>
followed by Mr. Bergman, and then Mrs. Hammarskjöld

<<218.27;220.15;en>>
for the government.

<<220.15;236.55;en>>
I would explain that in addition to interpreting in the two official languages of the court, English and French, interpreting into Russian has been authorized for the benefit of a delegation from the Kyrgyz Republic attending this hearing.

<<236.55;243.11;en>>
This interpretation is not part of the official interpretation of the proceedings as organized by the court.

<<243.11;243.11;en>>
I call on Mrs. Evans and Mr. Bergman for the applicant.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<251.7;265.06;en>>
Madam President, members of the court, the Swedish National Defence Radio Establishment, or FRA, has been afforded extraordinary secret surveillance powers.

<<265.06;280.28;en>>
It is able to intercept all communications transmitted over the airwaves or along the fiber optic cables that traverse the Swedish border, acting as the digital arteries for virtually all online cross-border communications.

<<280.28;290.38;en>>
Through its interception operations, the FRA is able to obtain vast quantities of private, intimate, even legally privileged information.

<<293.84;299.98;en>>
It is able to obtain this from an unspecified number of people and organizations.

<<299.98;309.38;en>>
These persons need not be reasonably suspected of a crime or any wrongdoing, nor actually be of any foreign intelligence interest at all.

<<309.38;319.57;en>>
If their communications meet the selectors or search terms employed by the FRA, then their private communications will be caught by its net.

<<319.57;331.3;en>>
The mere existence of the Swedish signals intelligence regime constitutes an interference with the protection afforded to privacy and correspondence under Article 8 of the Convention.

<<331.3;339.06;en>>
It has a potential chilling effect on the free exchange of information and ideas that underpin any healthy democracy.

<<339.06;352.34;en>>
This interference further pervades every stage of the surveillance process, from the initial collection through to the storage, use, analysis, and transfer of intercepted material.

<<352.34;366.86;en>>
This case, together with the case of Big Brother Watch and others against the United Kingdom, heard by the Grand Chamber earlier today, represents an important moment for the protection of privacy and correspondence in the digital age.

<<366.86;381.25;en>>
It is the first opportunity for Europe's premier human rights court to stipulate whether and under what conditions bulk interception of this scale and intensity may be carried out under the Convention.

<<381.25;395.1;en>>
This case in particular raises important questions about the consideration that member states should give to human rights when transferring intercepted data to foreign governments and to international organizations.

<<395.1;402.69;en>>
I will first address the court on the issue of when secret surveillance may constitute a justified interference with Article 8 of the Convention.

<<402.69;409.34;en>>
I will then turn to highlight five key deficiencies with the Swedish signals intelligence regime.

<<409.34;414.81;en>>
Finally, I will conclude with some brief remarks on the applicant's victim status and admissibility.

<<414.81;416.62;en>>
Mr. Bergman is then ready to respond

<<416.62;422.1;en>>
to any further questions from the court in the second round of submissions.

<<422.1;430.65;en>>
I turn then firstly to address the question of when secret surveillance may be a justified interference with Article 8 of the Convention.

<<430.65;444.24;en>>
There are compelling reasons why this court may wish to hold that bulk interception regimes of the scale and intensity as that in the present case can never constitute a justified interference with Article 8.

<<444.24;464.1;en>>
Whenever this court has examined a secret surveillance system and gone on to hold that they are in fact compatible with the Convention, it has often justified doing so by the reference to its targeted, specific, and contained nature, the very opposing qualities of that of a large-scale modern bulk interception regime.

<<464.1;472.54;en>>
We deal with this point in our further written observations at paragraphs 27 through to 35.

<<472.54;486.86;en>>
If, however, the court decides that the bulk interception surveillance such as that in the present case falls within a member state's margin of appreciation, it must surely acknowledge that it falls on its outermost edge.

<<486.86;496.36;en>>
And this fact must color the way in which the court assesses the quality of the safeguards that must be in place at the national level.

<<496.36;508.34;en>>
European supervision of the margin of appreciation must demand safeguards that are truly robust and commensurate with the privacy risks that a system presents.

<<508.34;513.46;en>>
This court has developed a series of minimum safeguards that must apply to secret surveillance.

<<513.46;519.38;en>>
The Grand Chamber affirmed these with respect to targeted surveillance in its recent case of Zakharov.

<<519.38;531.34;en>>
They include prior authorization, limits on scope and duration, procedures for processing and transfer, independent supervision, and remedies.

<<531.34;543.25;en>>
These safeguards are designed to ensure that surveillance is conducted in accordance with the law and is confined to what is necessary in a democratic society for the pursuit of its legitimate aims.

<<543.25;554.13;en>>
We have made several submissions as to how these safeguards should be updated and adapted when applied to a bulk interception surveillance regime within the context of foreign intelligence.

<<554.13;561.5;en>>
These submissions can be found at paragraphs 36 to 80 in our further written observations.

<<561.5;570.86;en>>
In any case, however, the Swedish signals intelligence regime falls short of even the minimum safeguards in their existing formulation.

<<570.86;578.86;en>>
We wish to highlight five key deficiencies in the Swedish framework that we feel are of particular importance.

<<578.86;587.1;en>>
The first key deficiency is that the Swedish framework lacks appropriate safeguards to limit the duration of surveillance.

<<587.1;598.36;en>>
It has been a longstanding feature in this court's case law that the duration of surveillance operations must be subject to certain limits in order to protect against their excessive use.

<<598.36;606.13;en>>
In the case of Zakharov, the grand chamber cited three important safeguards to be set out in domestic law.

<<606.13;610.93;en>>
First, there should be rules on when a warrant expires.

<<610.93;617.5;en>>
Second, the law should specify the conditions under which a warrant may be renewed.

<<617.5;624.13;en>>
And third, the law should set out the circumstances when a warrant must be canceled.

<<624.13;635.86;en>>
The grand chamber found that the Russian laws governing secret surveillance for national security purposes contained the first two safeguards, but failed to contain the third relating to cancellation.

<<635.86;644.36;en>>
It found, therefore, that the Russian system failed to provide sufficient guarantees against arbitrary interference.

<<644.36;648.89;en>>
The Swedish regime contains precisely the same shortcoming.

<<648.89;655.17;en>>
Section 5A of the Swedish signals intelligence act fulfills safeguards one and two.

<<655.17;663.06;en>>
It states that a warrant may be valid for a maximum period of six months and may be subject to renewal at six monthly intervals.

<<663.06;672.06;en>>
But neither the act nor any other law contains a discontinuation provision specifying when a warrant must be canceled.

<<672.06;687.69;en>>
Unlike in a criminal surveillance operation, which is governed by the Swedish code of judicial procedure, there is no legal obligation to cancel a warrant when the required conditions have ceased to exist or the measures themselves are no longer necessary.

<<687.69;696.45;en>>
Without such a provision, excessive and inappropriate surveillance is capable of continuing for several months until the warrant eventually expires on its own.

<<699.15;709.38;en>>
Given the sheer volume of information that could be obtained through bulk interception in that time, this absence in the Swedish framework is of critical importance.

<<709.38;719.15;en>>
We would invite the Grand Chamber, therefore, to repeat its conclusion in Zakharov and find that the Swedish system fails to provide sufficient guarantees against arbitrary interference.

<<722.82;732.01;en>>
The second key deficiency is the lack of protection for data relating exclusively to legal persons, such as the applicant.

<<732.01;744.3;en>>
This relates to the requirement for proper procedural safeguards relating to the storing, accessing, examining, using, communicating, and destroying of intercepted data.

<<744.3;750.52;en>>
The Signals Intelligence Act primarily sets out when and how an interception can be made.

<<750.52;757.46;en>>
It contains few conditions for the actual use and analysis of the intercepted material once it has been collected.

<<757.46;763.66;en>>
These conditions are set down in a different statute, the FRA Data Processing Act.

<<763.66;772.53;en>>
The problem, however, is that the FRA Data Processing Act only applies to intercepted material containing personal data.

<<772.53;779.45;en>>
Chapter 1, section 4 of this act provides a definition of personal data as follows.

<<779.45;786.05;en>>
Information that is directly or indirectly related to a natural living person.

<<786.05;793.21;en>>
This means that the FRA Data Processing Act does not apply to intercepted material relating to legal persons.

<<793.21;812.82;en>>
What this means, then, is that whole swathes of correspondence pertaining to law firms, private businesses, churches, public watchdogs, or press associations can fall entirely outside of the key piece of legislation affording protection for the processing of intercepted material.

<<812.82;822.26;en>>
So long as intercepted material does not contain, or presumably is altered so as not to contain personal data, it may be kept forever.

<<822.26;827.38;en>>
It may be used for purposes incompatible with the original purpose of collection.

<<827.38;836.45;en>>
And it may be passed on to foreign governments and international organizations, even if it is irrelevant to the original tasking directive.

<<836.45;839.62;en>>
This is far from an unfortunate omission.

<<839.62;847.45;en>>
This was an active decision taken by the government to exclude legal persons from the protection afforded by this act.

<<847.45;864.06;en>>
The initial proposal for the FRA Data Processing Act, prepared by an expert committee, specifically advised that legal persons should fall within this law's scope, given that the FRA processes large volumes of information related to legal persons.

<<864.06;872.78;en>>
The government rejected this advice when preparing the law, stating only that it needed to protect the private lives of natural persons.

<<872.78;887.66;en>>
This rejection failed to recognize the importance of affording protection not just to privacy, but also to the protection of correspondence, which is afforded to both natural and legal persons under Article 8 of the Convention.

<<887.66;896.54;en>>
This commentary from the government can be found at page 47 of enclosure 40 to our further written observations.

<<896.54;906.13;en>>
We do not necessarily suggest that the information relating to legal persons should be afforded identical protection to that relating to private individuals.

<<906.13;921.34;en>>
But to have, for instance, no storage limitation and no purpose limitation for such material leaves the right to the protection of correspondence for organizations unduly vulnerable to unfettered discretion.

<<921.34;934.01;en>>
In its judgment, the chamber acknowledged our submissions in that certain remedies were not available to legal persons under the Swedish framework, such as a data subject access request or notification.

<<934.01;945.94;en>>
It did not, however, address this more wide-ranging problem that most of the protection at the analysis and use phase does not apply to material that does not contain personal data.

<<945.94;957.54;en>>
With respect to the chamber, we would ask that this court correct this omission and find that this feature of the Swedish legal framework is in breach of Article 8.

<<957.54;970.38;en>>
The third key deficiency is that the Swedish system does not give any independent body or bodies sufficient supervisory control over the FRA's bulk interception activities.

<<970.38;981.82;en>>
In the case of Zakharov, the grand chamber made clear that supervisory bodies must be vested with sufficient powers to exercise effective and continuous control.

<<981.82;993.84;en>>
They must be able to take measures to stop or remedy detected breaches of the law, and that it is for the government to be able to demonstrate that such powers are effective in practice.

<<993.84;1000.53;en>>
The primary body charged with supervising the FRA is the Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate.

<<1000.53;1009.17;en>>
This grand chamber has asked us to clarify exactly what the inspectorate can and cannot make legally binding decisions about.

<<1009.17;1015.1;en>>
Let us first look at the legally binding decisions that the inspectorate can make.

<<1015.1;1023.1;en>>
The inspectorate can make binding decisions where it finds that the FRA has violated the terms of a warrant.

<<1023.1;1026.34;en>>
That is the only circumstance.

<<1026.34;1033.06;en>>
It may order such activities to stop and may order the information obtained in contravention of the warrant to be destroyed.

<<1033.06;1045.13;en>>
This is in accordance with section 10 of the Signals Intelligence Act, which can be found at enclosures 49 and 50 of our further written observations.

<<1045.13;1049.97;en>>
Let us now turn, however, to what the inspectorate cannot do.

<<1049.97;1053.28;en>>
It cannot quash the warrant itself.

<<1053.28;1061.55;en>>
And importantly, it cannot make legally binding decisions relating to any other breach of applicable laws.

<<1061.55;1065.01;en>>
Two circumstances are of particular note here.

<<1065.01;1072.49;en>>
Firstly, the inspectorate cannot make legally binding decisions relating to the breaches of the FRA Data Processing Act.

<<1072.49;1076.69;en>>
Instead, it must report the matter to the Data Protection Authority.

<<1076.69;1089.89;en>>
This is in accordance with section 15 of the Ordinance with Instructions for the Swedish Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate, found at enclosures 49 and 50 of our further written observations.

<<1089.89;1096.63;en>>
The Data Protection Authority itself cannot make any legally binding decisions with respect to the FRA.

<<1096.63;1099.82;en>>
It cannot impose any fine or penalty on it.

<<1099.82;1106.32;en>>
And it is under no obligation to take any action upon receiving a report from the inspectorate.

<<1106.32;1118.78;en>>
If it does choose to act, all that the Data Protection Authority can do is communicate its views to the FRA, or possibly obtain a court order from the Swedish Administrative Court.

<<1118.78;1128.97;en>>
The Administrative Court does not have a granted right of access to closed material, and does not have the power to order the FRA to stop the unlawful processing.

<<1128.97;1140.62;en>>
Such a court order has never been pursued, as was confirmed by the court itself in a statement contained at enclosure 21 of our further written observations.

<<1140.62;1149.78;en>>
The second point is that the inspectorate cannot make legally binding decisions on interception activities that breach the European Convention.

<<1149.78;1154.1;en>>
It has no specific mandate to conduct a review on such grounds.

<<1154.1;1162.58;en>>
And even if it suspects that such acts have occurred, it must merely report these to the Chancellor of Justice in certain limited cases.

<<1162.58;1173.69;en>>
The Chancellor of Justice has no specific responsibility to supervise the FRA, and is under no obligation to act upon receiving such a report from the inspectorate.

<<1173.69;1181.93;en>>
It has no authority to order the FRA to cease any interception activities, nor to order the destruction of data.

<<1181.93;1201.41;en>>
It is perhaps telling that, to our knowledge, the Chancellor of Justice has no government instructions for how to handle a report from the inspectorate, despite having similar instructions on reporting from the government authority that oversees secret surveillance in criminal investigations.

<<1201.41;1217.78;en>>
The overall system, therefore, is one of limited and insufficient supervisory oversight by the inspectorate, coupled with some general reporting obligations to other authorities, which themselves lack the authority to issue legally binding decisions on the FRA.

<<1217.78;1225.17;en>>
They do not have sufficient competence in theory, and the government has failed to show that they are effective in practice.

<<1225.17;1238.57;en>>
We say, therefore, that the Swedish framework clearly falls short of the minimum safeguards articulated by this grand chamber in Zakharov, and constitutes a breach of the minimum safeguards required.

<<1238.57;1242.09;en>>
We would also add a further point relating to supervision.

<<1242.09;1248.93;en>>
The grand chamber has asked both parties to clarify their positions on the FRA's record-keeping practices.

<<1248.93;1260.34;en>>
Our position is that the keeping of detailed records is essential for ensuring that supervisory bodies have sufficient access to information in order to monitor compliance.

<<1260.34;1273.49;en>>
The importance of having an obligation to do so has been highlighted by the court in Zakharov at paragraph 272, and in the Kennedy case at paragraph 165.

<<1273.49;1279.45;en>>
There is no legal obligation for the FRA to keep details of its interception activities.

<<1279.45;1292.38;en>>
This means that record-keeping practices essentially lie at the mercy of internal procedures and discretion, and far from the formal legal footing on which such an important safeguard should be placed.

<<1292.38;1299.78;en>>
Furthermore, the government has failed to sufficiently demonstrate that there are comprehensive record-keeping procedures in practice.

<<1299.78;1306.28;en>>
It has pointed to the isolated issue of logs that are kept on when data is destroyed.

<<1306.28;1321.38;en>>
It has also confirmed now that the data protection authorities' repeated criticism of the FRA's logs and follow-up of those logs has now been addressed, at least in respect to how they ensure the adequate security of personal data.

<<1321.38;1324.06;en>>
But these are two isolated issues.

<<1324.06;1344.25;en>>
We say that the FRA must ensure that there is sufficiently detailed information on all key aspects of a surveillance operation, ranging from collection, analysis, use, and transfer, and that the government has not adequately demonstrated that such record-keeping does, in fact, take place.

<<1344.25;1355.41;en>>
I now move to the fourth key deficiency, which is the lack of appropriate notification and remedies for persons affected by unlawful secret surveillance.

<<1355.41;1363.41;en>>
Let us consider the position of a person that fears that they may have been subject to unlawful secret surveillance by the FRA.

<<1363.41;1366.97;en>>
In theory, the FRA must notify them.

<<1366.97;1372.93;en>>
However, this requirement only applies to private persons and not to legal persons such as the applicant.

<<1372.93;1387.79;en>>
It is only required when a person's personal data is used as a selector in the initial phase of collection and not when a person's personal data is used to filter or process results in the subsequent analysis phase.

<<1387.79;1394.91;en>>
And in any event, the notification requirement has always been disapplied on the grounds of secrecy.

<<1394.91;1403.3;en>>
We would echo the words of the chamber, therefore, in stating that this notification requirement lacks practical significance.

<<1403.3;1407.53;en>>
If a person is never notified, then what may it do?

<<1407.53;1413.51;en>>
Unlike in the United Kingdom, there is no designated court or tribunal where this person may lodge a claim.

<<1413.51;1423.86;en>>
Instead, it can only ask the inspectorate to investigate whether they have been subject to secret surveillance, and if so, whether this was carried out lawfully.

<<1423.86;1436.69;en>>
The inspectorate, however, is only required to inform that person that an investigation has been carried out and is not obliged to inform them of its findings or give any reasons for its decision.

<<1436.69;1442.38;en>>
There is no opportunity to appeal this decision to any other body.

<<1442.38;1456.17;en>>
As we have mentioned, the inspectorate can only stop activities that contravene a warrant, meaning that any other unlawful activities it discovers in the course of its investigation potentially proceed without any proper recourse.

<<1456.17;1463.25;en>>
And in any event, the inspectorate has no power to grant that person compensation.

<<1463.25;1475.01;en>>
Now, in a bid to try and rescue this point, the government has invoked a whole host of general remedies under Swedish law that it says are available to a potential victim of unlawful secret surveillance.

<<1475.01;1482.25;en>>
We say that none of these constitute an effective remedy in and of themselves, nor in aggregate.

<<1482.25;1487.65;en>>
First, the government says that a person may bring a civil suit against the government for damages.

<<1487.65;1494.78;en>>
But the person must discharge the requisite burden of proof and show that unlawful activity has, in fact, taken place.

<<1494.78;1503.97;en>>
This is virtually impossible without proper notification or access to information, both of which are prevented on the grounds of secrecy.

<<1503.97;1509.34;en>>
This is exactly what the grand chamber concluded on a similar point in Zakharov.

<<1509.34;1519.06;en>>
In any event, a civil court would not have the authority to stop the offending surveillance activity or to order the destruction of the relevant data.

<<1519.06;1524.8;en>>
Second, the government suggests that a person can exercise their rights under data protection law.

<<1524.8;1537.91;en>>
They could issue a data subject access request for information on processing, request that the FRA erase unlawfully processed data, or lodge a complaint to the Data Protection Authority itself.

<<1537.91;1548.12;en>>
These remedies are only available for private individuals and not legal persons, and in any event, are theoretical and illusory in these circumstances.

<<1548.12;1552.84;en>>
Data subject access requests may be refused on the grounds of secrecy.

<<1552.84;1556.65;en>>
And accordingly, the FRA has never granted one.

<<1556.65;1565.1;en>>
Requesting erasure of particular data requires knowledge that the data exists in the first place, which secrecy also prevents.

<<1565.1;1579.67;en>>
And the Data Protection Authority has no authority itself to issue binding decisions against the FRA, and therefore suffers from the same shortcomings here as we have mentioned in respect to supervision.

<<1579.67;1587.27;en>>
Finally, the government refers to the Chancellor of Justice and the Parliamentary Ombudsman as providing adequate and effective remedies.

<<1587.27;1591.1;en>>
Neither of these bodies can issue legally binding decisions.

<<1591.1;1595.69;en>>
The Parliamentary Ombudsman can't even issue compensation.

<<1595.69;1610.06;en>>
As the court itself observed in the case of Sergestedt-Wieberg, these institutions merely exercise general supervision and do not have specific responsibility for inquiries into secret surveillance.

<<1610.06;1617.54;en>>
The Chancellor of Justice has confirmed that it has never taken any action on any complaints against the FRA.

<<1617.54;1634.58;en>>
The Parliamentary Ombudsman itself described itself as an extraordinary regulatory agency and stated that in 22 years, the only action it has ever taken in response to a complaint against the FRA was a single phone call.

<<1634.58;1641.41;en>>
These statements can be found at enclosures 12 and 13 of our further written observations.

<<1641.41;1649.45;en>>
We say, therefore, that these bodies are of no practical significance to the question of remedies.

<<1649.45;1655.57;en>>
We appreciate the challenges involved in affording appropriate remedies while maintaining secrecy.

<<1655.57;1657.65;en>>
This is not easy.

<<1657.65;1669.21;en>>
But especially where the net of those subject to secret surveillance is cast so widely and without any requirement for reasonable suspicion, the government must be required to do more.

<<1669.21;1680.46;en>>
This court has repeatedly stated in its case law that even in a secret surveillance context, the state must provide remedies that are as effective as can be.

<<1680.46;1684.18;en>>
We know that more effective remedies are possible.

<<1684.18;1696.54;en>>
The United Kingdom's Investigatory Powers Tribunal, or IPT, allows parties to issue complaints of unlawful interception without the need to prove that they have been subject to secret surveillance.

<<1696.54;1707.34;en>>
It has access to all relevant secret documents and may quash interception orders, order the destruction of unlawfully processed material, and issue compensation.

<<1707.34;1710.42;en>>
Its legal rulings are also published.

<<1710.42;1715.5;en>>
Whether even the IPT is sufficient is a question for another case.

<<1715.5;1721.78;en>>
But what it shows for our purposes is that Sweden's remedies are clearly not as effective as can be.

<<1724.89;1732.73;en>>
The fifth and final deficiency that we wish to highlight is perhaps the most glaring of all.

<<1732.73;1747.29;en>>
It is that the Swedish government may readily transfer intercepted communication to foreign governments and international organizations with virtually no legal safeguards for privacy or integrity of the affected persons.

<<1747.29;1754.21;en>>
There is no legal obligation for the government to ensure that transferred information is afforded adequate protection.

<<1754.21;1761.57;en>>
There is no obligation for the government to impose appropriate safeguards, such as limiting the subsequent use of that information.

<<1761.58;1771.38;en>>
In fact, there is no legal obligation for the government to have any regard for the privacy implications of its transfers at all.

<<1771.38;1778.93;en>>
The government has afforded two arguments in defense of what we say is a glaring absence in its legal framework.

<<1778.93;1784.5;en>>
The first argument is that international transfers are appropriately restricted by law.

<<1784.5;1794.78;en>>
It says that transfers to foreign governments and international organizations may only occur where the purpose is of benefit to the Swedish government and Sweden's defense strategy.

<<1794.78;1808.88;en>>
The FRA may only make such international transfers if they do not harm Sweden's interests, enhance FRA's defense and security cooperation, and the information is not protected by secrecy.

<<1808.88;1820.22;en>>
Even when such information is covered by secrecy, the government may nevertheless make such international transfers so long as they are necessary for the activities of the FRA.

<<1820.22;1827.89;en>>
With respect, these limitations are vague and entirely irrelevant to safeguarding individual rights.

<<1827.89;1837.02;en>>
They essentially allow international transfers to be made at any time governed by little more than broadly defined notions of national interest.

<<1837.02;1846.93;en>>
They do little to restrict the discretion of the government, and they do nothing to require that the interests of the affected person be taken into consideration.

<<1846.93;1857.13;en>>
This is the conclusion that the chamber reached in its judgment at paragraph 150, and it is the conclusion that we invite this court to make also.

<<1857.13;1878.1;en>>
The government's second argument was that its approach to international transfers is consistent with its international obligations, namely those contained in the additional protocol to the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data, to which Sweden is a party.

<<1878.1;1895.78;en>>
This additional protocol states that parties must ensure an adequate level of protection for personal transfers to third countries, but that derogation is permitted where there are legitimate prevailing interests, especially important public interests.

<<1895.78;1901.62;en>>
What the government fails to mention, however, is that this derogation is designed to be construed narrowly.

<<1901.62;1906.73;en>>
And warrants decisions falling under it to be made on a case-by-case basis.

<<1906.73;1932.78;en>>
The explanatory report to the additional protocol from the 8th of November, 2001 states, and I quote in full from paragraph 31 of the report, relevant domestic law provisions must respect the principle inherent in European law that clauses making exceptions are interpreted restrictively, so that the exception does not become the rule.

<<1932.78;1937.8;en>>
And yet Sweden's blanket reliance on this derogation does precisely that.

<<1937.8;1947.56;en>>
We say that such an approach is not consistent with the additional protocol, and importantly, is not compatible with Article 8 of the convention.

<<1947.56;1961.79;en>>
The chamber clearly noted the shortcomings of the Swedish system with international transfers, stating that it lacked specification, and give some concern with respect to the possible abuse of the rights of individuals.

<<1961.79;1972.49;en>>
The chamber went on, however, not to find a violation of the convention, stating that the supervisory elements of the Swedish framework counterbalanced these shortcomings.

<<1972.49;1983.99;en>>
With deep respect to the chamber, we would strongly disagree that the supervisory elements are somehow capable of remedying these particular shortcomings with respect to international transfers.

<<1984.0;1998.14;en>>
Not only are the Swedish supervisory functions inadequate, as we have just described, as we've, but crucially, for this particular aspect, they do not properly cover Sweden's international transfer activities.

<<1998.14;2006.9;en>>
The FRA is merely required to inform the inspectorate of the principles governing its foreign intelligence cooperation.

<<2006.9;2017.02;en>>
It is required to tell the inspectorate to which countries or organizations it transfers data, and to provide general details of operations.

<<2017.02;2023.82;en>>
Crucially, the inspectorate is only capable of monitoring the FRA's compliance with existing laws.

<<2023.82;2037.69;en>>
As the Venice Commission observed in its 2015 report, if the boundaries of discretion are excessively wide, even the most stringent policing of them does little to safeguard against abuse.

<<2037.69;2047.39;en>>
Our position, therefore, is that Sweden's procedures for international transfers simply cannot constitute a practice compatible with the convention.

<<2047.39;2064.38;en>>
For this, a court to say otherwise would open up a dangerous lacuna in the protections afforded by the convention, where member states could simply outsource otherwise unlawful and intrusive interception activities without any legal consequence.

<<2064.38;2072.3;en>>
We accept the important role of intelligence sharing arrangements in promoting security and mutual intelligence interests.

<<2072.3;2080.65;en>>
But such arrangements cannot take place without proper limits or sufficient safeguards for fundamental rights.

<<2080.65;2089.22;en>>
Any one of these five key deficiencies that we have highlighted would, in and of itself, constitute a breach of the convention.

<<2089.22;2095.81;en>>
These deficiencies are not, with respect to the chamber, merely signs that there is room for improvement.

<<2095.81;2106.89;en>>
These are critical shortcomings on which this court should find a violation and require the government to make appropriate adjustments to its legal framework.

<<2106.89;2111.26;en>>
Finally, I shall make some brief remarks on the question of admissibility.

<<2111.26;2117.34;en>>
The government has suggested that the applicant lacks victim status, rendering this case inadmissible.

<<2117.34;2125.65;en>>
We say that the test for victim status laid down in Zakharov and in Kennedy is clearly fulfilled in the present case.

<<2125.65;2135.1;en>>
As the court affirmed in Zakharov, an applicant can establish victim status due to the mere existence of secret surveillance where two criteria are met.

<<2135.1;2147.69;en>>
The first requirement is that the applicant falls under the scope of the law, either by belonging to a particular targeted group or where the legislation directly affects all users of communication services.

<<2147.69;2152.95;en>>
As we have outlined, the Swedish Signals Intelligence Act is extremely broad.

<<2152.95;2162.53;en>>
It permits the potential interception of any communications traveling along the cables that cross the Swedish border or that are transmitted via the airways.

<<2162.53;2171.97;en>>
This scope directly affects all users of such communication services, as it allows for any such communications to potentially be intercepted.

<<2171.97;2183.57;en>>
The government contests that the legislation directly affects all users, claiming that only communications relating to foreign intelligence and thus foreign circumstances are allowed to be intercepted.

<<2183.57;2186.98;en>>
We say this argument is flawed for two reasons.

<<2186.98;2199.14;en>>
Firstly, we would point out that the Signals Intelligence Act also permits interception for development purposes, which not necessarily need to relate to foreign intelligence or foreign circumstances.

<<2199.14;2214.74;en>>
Secondly, virtually all users of the communication services may engage in cross-border communications, either deliberately by contacting a foreign recipient or inadvertently through communicating with an online server that is located abroad.

<<2214.74;2221.82;en>>
No user of these communications can guarantee that they will never be subject to interception.

<<2221.82;2234.86;en>>
The law, therefore, has a potential chilling effect on any user of these communications by its very existence and is of direct effect to all users of the communications falling under its scope.

<<2234.86;2239.1;en>>
The second requirement is that there is no effective remedy at the national level.

<<2239.1;2249.99;en>>
And as I have described, there is no effective remedy at the national level for the applicant nor for anyone else that suspects that they may have been subject to balkan deception by the FRA.

<<2249.99;2256.1;en>>
In these circumstances, therefore, the applicant must be able to have its case examined by this court.

<<2256.1;2265.86;en>>
To rule otherwise would depart from the ruling in Zakharov and deprive the applicant of any meaningful recourse for the protection of its rights.

<<2265.86;2282.02;en>>
This case is not only an opportunity for the applicant to seek protection of its rights, but for the grand chamber to make clear for all member states whether and on what terms large-scale balkan deception may be permitted under the convention.

<<2282.02;2295.36;en>>
It is our position that if far-reaching surveillance technology such as this is to be permitted, it must be infused to the fullest extent possible with a respect for privacy and protection of correspondence.

<<2295.36;2305.45;en>>
Privacy is an oxygen for other human rights, lingering invisibly, yet indispensably, breathing life into liberty, expression, and dignity.

<<2305.45;2313.1;en>>
These rights underpin the core democratic ideals that are at the heart of the convention and at the mission of the Council of Europe.

<<2313.1;2321.77;en>>
These must be protected even when, and perhaps especially when, we counter threats from those that do not share our values.

<<2321.77;2323.73;en>>
It is this core philosophy that we ask the court to uphold.

[[JudgeP;Angelika Nußberger]]

<<2328.26;2329.26;en>>
Thank you.

<<2329.26;2331.74;en>>
I call Mrs. Hammarskjöld for the government.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<2335.01;2347.41;en>>
Madam President, distinguished members of the court, the case before the court touches upon issues which are of crucial importance to the security of any modern democracy.

<<2347.41;2354.65;en>>
This morning, the court held a hearing in a case concerning the United Kingdom's signals intelligence system.

<<2354.65;2364.09;en>>
This afternoon, the court is asked to turn to a different system, the Swedish regime concerning signals intelligence within foreign intelligence.

<<2364.09;2369.61;en>>
There are common denominators between the two, but there are also differences.

<<2369.61;2376.3;en>>
Allow me, therefore, at the outset to mention three distinct features of the Swedish system.

<<2376.3;2389.89;en>>
Firstly, the Swedish regime exclusively concerns national security issues in the context of foreign intelligence and does not permit the use of signals intelligence to investigate criminal offenses.

<<2389.89;2397.45;en>>
Secondly, the Swedish signals intelligence regime includes a judicial permit procedure.

<<2397.45;2412.38;en>>
Thirdly, the signals intelligence conducted by the National Defense Radio Establishment, which I will refer to as the FRA, is supervised by a special control authority, the Swedish Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate.

<<2412.38;2424.45;en>>
Although not a court, the inspectorate is an independent control authority vested with the necessary powers and competence to exercise effective controls.

<<2424.45;2441.34;en>>
Madam President, the two cases before the Grand Chamber today provide the court with a unique opportunity to confirm what standards should apply to regimes established in order to acquire intelligence that is critical for the protection of national security.

<<2441.34;2451.86;en>>
It is the hope of my government that the court will reaffirm that such regimes may differ but still meet the convention standards.

<<2451.86;2471.26;en>>
A year ago, the third section of this court found that the Swedish regime provides adequate and sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness and the risk of abuse and that the structure and operation of the system are proportionate to the legitimate aim of national security.

<<2471.26;2487.97;en>>
The third section looked at the increased sophistication of communications, technology, as well as the present day threats posed by global terrorism and acknowledged the importance of a signals intelligence system in order to discover such threats.

<<2487.97;2499.26;en>>
It found that the Swedish signals intelligence regime minimizes the risk of interference with privacy and compensates for the lack of openness inherent in any secret surveillance system.

<<2499.26;2505.82;en>>
My government argues that this analysis of the Swedish signals intelligence system is correct.

<<2505.82;2516.97;en>>
Madam President, in its written observations, my government has described in detail why the Swedish signals intelligence regime meets the convention standards.

<<2516.97;2522.89;en>>
I'd like to take the opportunity here today to elaborate on a few points.

<<2522.89;2529.55;en>>
I will first turn to the issue of the contracting state's margin of appreciation in this context.

<<2529.55;2541.13;en>>
I will then move on to describe the strictly limited scope of the signals intelligence regime and why there cannot be a requirement of reasonable suspicion.

<<2541.13;2549.24;en>>
I will address the issue of the applicant's victim status and the possible interference with the rights under Article 8.

<<2549.24;2554.22;en>>
I will then turn to the justification for any such interference.

<<2554.22;2559.22;en>>
I will also say a few words concerning the alleged violation of Article 13.

<<2559.22;2567.57;en>>
Finally, I will respond to the specific questions posed by the court in its letter of 26 June.

<<2567.57;2582.74;en>>
Turning first to the importance of the contracting state's margin of appreciation, the applicant has argued that the court should find that signals intelligence regimes, such as the Swedish one, are inherently incompatible with the convention.

<<2582.74;2587.38;en>>
The consequences of such a finding would be incalculable.

<<2587.38;2596.86;en>>
Reliable intelligence collection capabilities are of critical importance to national security interests of democratic states today.

<<2596.86;2603.45;en>>
This is something that all the intervening governments have emphasized.

<<2603.45;2611.49;en>>
Contracting states face different challenges as the nature and level of threats vary.

<<2611.49;2622.09;en>>
That is why contracting states must enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in choosing how best to achieve the legitimate aim of protecting national security.

<<2622.09;2632.05;en>>
This court has expressly recognized this fact on several occasions with reference to the current threats facing many contracting states.

<<2632.05;2640.89;en>>
The operation of a signals intelligence regime must, of course, provide sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness and possible abuse.

<<2640.89;2653.11;en>>
However, such safeguards cannot undermine the effectiveness of regimes established in order to obtain intelligence that is essential to the protection of the lives and the safety of the public.

<<2653.11;2655.03;en>>
The court's practice has struck such a balance.

<<2658.45;2670.22;en>>
Since constitutional frameworks and legal systems vary between contracting states, there is no one single blueprint for how these safeguards should be designed.

<<2670.22;2688.84;en>>
Therefore, when the court is to examine a signals intelligence regime in abstracto, an overall assessment needs to be made of the whole system in order to evaluate whether there are sufficient safeguards in place to protect the public from abuse.

<<2688.84;2698.73;en>>
If there are robust safeguards in some aspects of a system, the state must be afforded greater discretion in other aspects.

<<2698.74;2706.69;en>>
My government trusts that the court will continue its balanced approach, and it will not try to carve out a detailed mold that all systems must fit into.

<<2709.61;2720.97;en>>
Madam President, the two cases before the Grand Chamber today will make it clear to the court that signals intelligence is an indispensable tool in the protection of national security.

<<2720.97;2725.61;en>>
I will now move on to describe the strictly limited scope of the Swedish signals intelligence regime.

<<2725.61;2736.38;en>>
The purpose of the signals intelligence conducted by the FRA is to obtain information and identify phenomena of relevance for foreign intelligence.

<<2736.38;2747.34;en>>
The FRA provides the government and other Swedish authorities with unique knowledge of foreign developments, which is essential to protecting Sweden from national security threats.

<<2747.34;2758.45;en>>
Typical examples of data being processed in signals intelligence concern the use of a single-signal weapon, and the use of a single-signal weapon is a key element of the intelligence system.

<<2758.45;2787.45;en>>
The data being processed in signals intelligence concern foreign military movements, military exercises, and tests of military weapon systems in the vicinity of Sweden, international terrorism, strategic information of significance for Sweden's foreign and defense policy, and international relations, but also personal data about individuals working in other states' intelligence requirements that cannot be satisfied by any other means.

<<2787.45;2797.09;en>>
Therefore, signals intelligence also fulfills the government's positive obligation to protect the lives and the safety of the public.

<<2797.09;2807.78;en>>
The applicant claims that the Swedish signals intelligence regime is a large-scale interception regime, and that the government covertly monitors all cross-border communications.

<<2807.78;2810.34;en>>
This is grossly inaccurate.

<<2810.34;2830.73;en>>
On the contrary, signals intelligence within foreign intelligence may only be conducted for the specific purposes and under the specific terms outlined in law, and using specifically formulated selectors in order to only intercept the relevant signals.

<<2830.73;2841.18;en>>
Madam President, signals intelligence may only concern foreign circumstances and may only be conducted by one authority, the FRA.

<<2841.18;2853.82;en>>
It must be conducted in accordance with the government's annual tasking directives and the detailed tasking directives issued by those authorities listed in the legislation.

<<2853.82;2864.57;en>>
Any collection requires a permit from the Foreign Intelligence Court, which ensures that all these prerequisites are satisfied.

<<2864.57;2871.97;en>>
The operation of the signals intelligence regime is therefore a narrowly tailored instrument.

<<2871.97;2882.34;en>>
My government has explained throughout this case that under Swedish law, signals intelligence within foreign intelligence may not be used to investigate criminal offenses.

<<2882.34;2890.49;en>>
Nonetheless, the applicant has insisted on trying to give the court the impression that the signals intelligence system could be used for such purposes.

<<2890.49;2900.86;en>>
Let me once again clarify that the legislation on signals intelligence does not permit the use of signals intelligence to investigate criminal offenses.

<<2900.86;2909.3;en>>
As stated in my government's written observations, it's the duty of the Foreign Intelligence Court to ensure this.

<<2909.3;2915.93;en>>
The Swedish Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate also has important supervisory functions in this regard.

<<2915.93;2926.09;en>>
Hence, the system guarantees that signals intelligence is not used to circumvent regulations concerning coercive measures under criminal law, for example.

<<2926.09;2944.05;en>>
It's a different matter entirely, Madam President, that signals intelligence may, under certain circumstances, be used to collect information that is provided to the Swedish Security Service and the National Operations Department of the Swedish Police Authority, the NOA, within their intelligence activities.

<<2944.05;2954.95;en>>
This information may concern, for example, foreign powers intelligence operations against Sweden, external cyber threats, and international terrorism.

<<2954.95;2971.34;en>>
The Swedish Parliament has recently adopted legislation giving the Swedish Security Service and the NOA the possibility to receive intelligence reports from the FRA within their intelligence activities, regardless of whether a preliminary investigation is ongoing.

<<2971.34;2978.61;en>>
The new act clearly stipulates that reported data may not be used to investigate criminal offenses.

<<2978.61;2989.51;en>>
It also states that individuals' officials' access to reported intelligence must be restricted to what is necessary to perform their duties.

<<2989.51;2998.26;en>>
The Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection will be responsible for supervising the authorities' application of the new act.

<<2998.26;3014.3;en>>
Consequently, to sum up, it is clear that it will still not be permitted to use signals intelligence within foreign intelligence to investigate criminal offenses, and that the new legislation contains adequate and sufficient safeguards against abuse.

<<3014.3;3024.93;en>>
Madam President, another point which has been raised is whether there should be a requirement of reasonable suspicion in the context of signals intelligence within foreign intelligence.

<<3024.93;3029.26;en>>
There cannot and there should not be any such requirement.

<<3029.26;3034.26;en>>
On this point, all the intervening governments agree.

<<3034.26;3044.34;en>>
The applicant, however, has argued that if there is no such requirement, the court would make an unreasoned distinction between law enforcement and foreign intelligence.

<<3044.34;3051.3;en>>
But there are crucial differences between foreign intelligence and law enforcement that justify such a distinction.

<<3051.3;3054.22;en>>
Let me illustrate.

<<3054.22;3066.13;en>>
Foreign intelligence is a proactive activity, aiming at finding or identifying an external threat to Sweden, regardless of whether or not that threat involves a criminal act.

<<3066.13;3076.69;en>>
In contrast, law enforcement, in the sense that is relevant in this context, is about investigating a crime where a threat has already materialized.

<<3076.69;3091.38;en>>
A requirement of reasonable suspicion would render the operation of the Swedish regime concerning signals intelligence within foreign intelligence impossible, as it concerns states and other actors whose actions are not necessarily criminal.

<<3091.38;3105.05;en>>
Also, the purposes of signals intelligence within foreign intelligence are mainly to look for and identify hitherto unknown dangers, while at the same time monitoring known ones.

<<3105.05;3113.78;en>>
Moreover, a tasking directive for signals intelligence may not solely target a specific individual.

<<3113.78;3124.51;en>>
In addition, any use of selectors that may be linked to specific individuals is only permitted by the Foreign Intelligence Court if it is necessary and proportionate.

<<3124.51;3136.34;en>>
As such, the signals intelligence regime already provides the necessary level of protection corresponding to a materiality threshold, as requested by the applicant.

<<3136.34;3144.3;en>>
I will now turn to the applicant's victim status and the issue of a possible interference with the rights under Article 8.

<<3144.3;3155.78;en>>
Can the applicant claim to be a victim of a violation of the convention, occasioned by the mere existence of the Swedish legislation on signals intelligence within foreign intelligence?

<<3155.78;3159.14;en>>
The short answer, Madam President, is no.

<<3159.14;3164.26;en>>
However, for the sake of clarity, let me elaborate.

<<3164.26;3174.65;en>>
The signals intelligence process contains several stages designed to reduce the data ultimately available for analytical examination to a manageable minimum.

<<3174.65;3182.09;en>>
First, signals intelligence may not be conducted on domestic traffic within Sweden.

<<3182.09;3194.82;en>>
Since the majority of purely domestic electronic communication signals will not pass the handover points in cross-border cables, such signals will not be collected by the FRA.

<<3194.82;3207.73;en>>
The signals that pass through the signals carriers covered by a permit are subject to filtering, which means that any data that is not selected disappears without any possibility of being reproduced.

<<3207.73;3209.97;en>>
This data will not be available to the FRA.

<<3212.97;3226.26;en>>
The data that is accessible to the FRA after the selection and filtering processes is subject to further refinement through automatic and manual means before it is available for analytical examination.

<<3226.26;3241.57;en>>
My government's position is that a secret surveillance measure is not applied until an analytical examination is possible, and that there is no interference with rights under Article 8 until that stage of the signals intelligence process.

<<3241.57;3247.26;en>>
The risk of the applicant's communications reaching this stage is virtually non-existent.

<<3247.26;3258.69;en>>
Therefore, the applicant can neither claim to be a victim of a violation of the convention, nor complain of an interference with its rights under Article 8 on the account of the mere existence of the signals intelligence regime.

<<3258.69;3263.3;en>>
Thank you.

<<3263.3;3267.05;en>>
To turn then to what applies to communications data.

<<3270.22;3277.22;en>>
No distinction is made under Swedish legislation between content and communications data.

<<3277.22;3282.01;en>>
A permit is required for the collection and processing of communications data as it is for content.

<<3285.41;3301.93;en>>
Communications data is largely used to discover threats or targets of which Sweden has previously been unaware, or as the United Kingdom puts it in its observations in the case heard this morning, to discover unknown unknowns.

<<3301.93;3313.26;en>>
Discovering previously unknown threats involves putting together various pieces of communications data to establish a picture through which a threat can be discovered.

<<3313.26;3321.34;en>>
This requires that the selectors used for interception of communications data are less specific than those used for interception of the content of communication.

<<3321.34;3328.89;en>>
It also requires that communications data is available for examination by an analyst over a period of time.

<<3328.89;3337.53;en>>
However, all searches in the available communications data must be justified in pursuit of a signals intelligent mission.

<<3340.3;3351.3;en>>
I also want to stress that when the purpose is to collect communications data with less specific selectors, no communication content is intercepted.

<<3351.3;3360.49;en>>
The applicant has held that collection of communications data constitutes an even greater intrusion than the collection of communications content.

<<3360.49;3363.22;en>>
I respectfully disagree.

<<3363.22;3381.09;en>>
Even when communications data is collected to provide a detailed picture of the communication patterns of a specific individual, which may reveal information that is sensitive and private, a greater degree of intrusion is always involved if the content of the individual's communication is examined.

<<3381.09;3390.65;en>>
Consequently, intercepting specific communications is, in general, more intrusive than obtaining communications data.

<<3390.65;3406.53;en>>
Turning now to the justification of any possible interference under Article 8, both parties agree that the Swedish signals intelligence regime has a basis in statutory law and is carried out in pursuit of a legitimate aim.

<<3406.53;3422.38;en>>
As for the safeguards, the third section of this court made an overall assessment and found that the Swedish signals intelligence regime provides adequate and sufficient safeguards to protect the public from arbitrariness and the risk of abuse.

<<3422.38;3441.81;en>>
In particular, the third section found that the scope of signals intelligence measures and the treatment of intercepted data are clearly defined in law, that the authorization procedure is detailed and entrusted to a judicial body, and that there are several independent bodies tasked with the supervision and review of the system.

<<3444.53;3459.01;en>>
For a detailed account of the safeguards in the Swedish signals intelligence regime, I would like to refer to my government's written observations, as well as my earlier observations about reasonable suspicion and a materiality threshold.

<<3459.01;3468.99;en>>
The applicant doesn't question the existence of most of the extensive safeguards in place in the Swedish signals intelligence regime.

<<3468.99;3477.45;en>>
But allow me, Madam President, to elaborate on a few points where my government's views diverge from that of the applicant.

<<3477.45;3487.8;en>>
If I first might address the issue of international cooperation, my government has described the legislation governing international cooperation in its written observations.

<<3487.8;3497.22;en>>
I will make one addition to illustrate that cooperation with other states is not used to circumvent domestic safeguards.

<<3497.22;3506.59;en>>
The applicant has provided the court with the FRA's general guidelines, which contain further restrictions on international cooperation.

<<3506.59;3516.11;en>>
These guidelines stipulate that international cooperation is conditional on the receiving state respecting Swedish legislation.

<<3516.11;3523.18;en>>
The Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate has a clear mandate to conduct controls of international cooperation.

<<3523.18;3533.85;en>>
So while it's correct that the FRA may amend its guidelines, such an amendment would not go unnoticed by the Swedish Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate.

<<3533.85;3545.73;en>>
The applicant holds that the Swedish Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate doesn't have the power to revoke a permit granted by the Foreign Intelligence Court if the inspectorate were to find it unlawful.

<<3545.73;3556.34;en>>
However, in the Swedish signals intelligence regime, any collection requires a permit from the Foreign Intelligence Court.

<<3556.34;3570.41;en>>
It would run counter to the foundations of the Swedish legal system if the Swedish Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate were to have the power to revoke a permit issued by the Foreign Intelligence Court.

<<3570.41;3578.06;en>>
This does not mean that the Swedish Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate is without any corrective means, however.

<<3578.06;3597.81;en>>
For instance, the inspectorate may decide that a specific collection must be terminated or that recordings or notes of collected data must be destroyed if it emerges during a control that the collection is incompatible with the permit issued under the Signals Intelligence Act.

<<3597.81;3604.26;en>>
Furthermore, the practical effectiveness of the inspectorate supervision has been determined by the National Audit Office.

<<3604.26;3622.01;en>>
In its 2015 report, the National Audit Office concluded that the inspectorate had been able to carry out its supervisory task effectively and that the FRA had taken the inspectorate's views and suggestions seriously and had implemented measures based on them.

<<3622.01;3632.41;en>>
The third section of this court was satisfied, but this showed that the inspectorate supervision is effective, not only in theory, but also in practice.

<<3632.41;3639.69;en>>
I would also like to correct some of the applicants' claims which might lead to misconceptions.

<<3639.69;3652.1;en>>
Firstly, after carrying out a control upon request by a natural or legal person, the inspectorate will inform the person of whether or not any improper collection has taken place.

<<3652.1;3668.84;en>>
Secondly, it follows from Swedish legislation that the Chancellor of Justice can and must act on any report from the Swedish Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate concerning deficiencies that may occur liability for damages for the state.

<<3668.84;3683.93;en>>
Thirdly, when a decision by the FRA not to disclose information is appealed, the Administrative Court of Appeal in Stockholm will gain access to all of the necessary classified documents.

<<3683.93;3688.53;en>>
The court will thus be able to carry out a full review of the FRA's decision.

<<3691.97;3699.14;en>>
Madam President, at this juncture, it's logical to say a few words concerning the alleged violation of Article 13.

<<3699.14;3704.22;en>>
I would mainly like to refer to my government's written observations.

<<3704.22;3708.57;en>>
Only one point needs to be made here today.

<<3708.57;3719.18;en>>
The applicant contends that a comparison with the United Kingdom's Investigatory Powers Tribunal illustrates that the Swedish remedies aren't as effective as they could be.

<<3719.18;3728.57;en>>
However, although it's not a court, the Swedish Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate's mandate doesn't differ greatly from that of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.

<<3728.57;3734.22;en>>
Let me briefly reiterate the main features of the inspectorate's mandate.

<<3734.22;3743.3;en>>
The inspectorate carries out extensive supervision and controls at its own initiative or at the request of an individual.

<<3743.3;3757.22;en>>
The FRA is obliged to cooperate fully, and the inspectorate has full access to all necessary data, compilations, as well as all necessary documents, including internal regulations and general guidelines.

<<3757.22;3765.14;en>>
If any improper collection were to have taken place, the individual concerned would be informed.

<<3765.14;3777.81;en>>
The inspectorate also reports any improper collection or mismanagement to the relevant authorities, which could lead to damages for the individual or to criminal prosecution of FRA staff.

<<3777.81;3786.77;en>>
In addition, the inspectorate has the power to decide that data collection must cease or that data already collected must be removed.

<<3786.77;3794.89;en>>
Data already collected must be destroyed, which is regulated in Section 10 of the Signals Intelligence Act.

<<3794.89;3802.13;en>>
It's clear that the inspectorate's scrutiny provides further elucidation of the general operation of the signals intelligence regime.

<<3802.13;3814.81;en>>
This is well illustrated by the inspectorate's annual reports, which is why my government has provided the court with a translation of the main parts of the 2018 annual report.

<<3814.82;3817.89;en>>
Mr. President, I'd now like to respond to the questions

<<3817.89;3826.02;en>>
specifically posed by the court on the 26th of June, which you have invited my government to include in the oral observations.

<<3826.02;3829.14;en>>
The first question concerns the keeping of records and logs.

<<3832.78;3841.3;en>>
I would first like to clarify that the Swedish Data Protection Authority has not criticized the FRA for not keeping logs.

<<3841.3;3850.41;en>>
The now obsolete criticism from the Swedish Data Protection Authority concerned the absence of a sufficient follow-up of logs by the FRA.

<<3850.41;3858.86;en>>
Since the 1st of January 2018, the FRA has had a central function for the monitoring and follow-up of logs.

<<3858.86;3866.34;en>>
Previously, it was the responsibility of each system owner within the FRA to make sure logs were monitored.

<<3866.34;3872.82;en>>
Now, logs from all new IT systems being brought into production are sent to the central function.

<<3872.82;3880.65;en>>
For older systems, logs are being reformatted and rerouted to this central function as soon as practicable.

<<3880.65;3891.45;en>>
The FRA has reported its actions to the Swedish Data Protection Authority, which has not requested any further actions from the FRA and has closed this file.

<<3891.45;3903.97;en>>
Logs are kept throughout the entire signals intelligence process, from the collection of data to the final reporting, including, for example, communication to other parties and destruction.

<<3903.97;3908.41;en>>
All searches made by analysts are logged.

<<3908.41;3926.89;en>>
As specifically concerns searches in data compilations containing personal data, the log has to include the search terms used, the time, the name of the analyst, and the justification for the search, including the detailed tasking directive, which is the reason for the search.

<<3926.89;3935.06;en>>
In addition to the logs, records are kept of certain measures, such as decisions taken in the course of the signals intelligence process.

<<3936.89;3950.41;en>>
The second question from the court concerns whether it's correct to say that all safeguards against abuse apply equally to interception and treatment of both the content of communications and communications data.

<<3950.41;3952.49;en>>
The answer to that question is yes.

<<3952.49;3961.45;en>>
The third question concerns the mandate of the Swedish Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate to make legally binding decisions.

<<3961.45;3968.85;en>>
The Inspectorate conducts its controls through inspections and other investigations at the FRA.

<<3968.85;3986.85;en>>
If the Inspectorate were to find evidence of improper signals collection, the Inspectorate has the power to decide that the collection must cease, or that recordings or notes of collected data must be destroyed, as laid out in section 10 of the Signals Intelligence Act.

<<3986.85;3991.85;en>>
This is a crucial element of the signals intelligence regime.

<<3991.85;3999.69;en>>
Moreover, the Inspectorate is vested with additional important mandates to fulfill its supervisory function.

<<3999.69;4017.02;en>>
If in the course of its activities the Inspectorate were to observe a circumstance that may constitute an offense, the Inspectorate must report it to the Swedish Prosecution Authority or another competent authority according to section 15 of the Inspectorate's instructions.

<<4017.02;4031.78;en>>
Pursuant to the same provision, the Inspectorate must also, if it observes irregularities that may entail liability for the state with respect to a natural or a legal person, report this to the Office of the Chancellor of Justice.

<<4031.78;4042.1;en>>
If the Inspectorate discovers circumstances that the Swedish Data Protection Authority should be made aware of, the Inspectorate must report them to the authority.

<<4042.1;4051.89;en>>
The Inspectorate must then attach its investigation to the report and assist the authority as necessary after the report has been submitted.

<<4051.89;4057.61;en>>
As outlined, the Inspectorate does have important decision-making powers.

<<4057.61;4071.57;en>>
The fact that the authority to take legally binding decisions specifically regarding prosecution or damages does not lie with the Inspectorate ensures that the authorities with the right competence for those matters are engaged.

<<4071.57;4075.93;en>>
They receive the necessary information and assistance from the Inspectorate.

<<4075.93;4084.78;en>>
This is the most correct approach under the Swedish legal order, which comprises strong constitutional protection for the independence of authorities.

<<4085.02;4101.41;en>>
Furthermore, if the Inspectorate finds it necessary, it can also submit a report to the Swedish Data Protection Authority, which will then submit the opinions and proposed measures that result from its control activities to the government.

<<4101.41;4110.9;en>>
Madam President, the fourth question concerns the interception of signals over the airways and the differences between automated and non-automated interception of signals.

<<4110.9;4119.38;en>>
Let me first clarify that we're talking about signals in electronic form, that is, signals carried by electromagnetic waves.

<<4119.38;4128.41;en>>
Exactly the same type of signals that are carried by signals carriers may occur in signals carriers conveyed over the airways.

<<4128.41;4134.81;en>>
Interception over the airways may cover both communications data and content.

<<4134.81;4142.9;en>>
Collection of signals is always performed in accordance with a valid permit from the Foreign Intelligence Court.

<<4142.9;4149.9;en>>
Automated collection of signals is always used for cable-based traffic and is regularly used for airborne traffic.

<<4149.9;4160.9;en>>
Non-automated collection of airborne signals is primarily used when there are no automated alternatives for near real-time reporting of foreign military activities.

<<4160.9;4176.1;en>>
Non-automated collection of signals is typically done by an operator who listens in real time to foreign military radio traffic on a certain radio frequency or looks at a screen where the energy from a signal in electronic form is illustrated.

<<4176.1;4183.26;en>>
The task is then to register relevant parts of processing analysis and reporting.

<<4183.26;4193.18;en>>
The automated selection process is always made through selectors or categories of selectors authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Court.

<<4193.18;4199.81;en>>
Selectors or categories of selectors are also used for non-automated collection of signals.

<<4199.81;4205.98;en>>
A radio frequency is one example of a selector that needs to be authorized by the court.

<<4205.98;4218.85;en>>
The Foreign Intelligence Court thus examines applications regarding non-automated collection of signals over the airways, which includes making the fundamental proportionality assessment stipulated by law.

<<4218.85;4229.01;en>>
The court hence ensures the same level of control as for automated interception or interception of cable-based traffic.

<<4229.01;4240.02;en>>
As my government has stated previously, an interference with Article 8 rights cannot occur until the stage where the processed information is available for analytical examination or consideration.

<<4240.02;4246.65;en>>
In this regard, it makes no difference whether the signals are transmitted through cables or over the airways.

<<4246.65;4253.34;en>>
Consequently, there is no need for adjustment of the safeguards against abuse.

<<4253.34;4265.69;en>>
Should be added here that it's my government's view that non-automated collection of signals from military radio doesn't affect any Article 8 rights.

<<4265.69;4271.31;en>>
The fifth question, Madam President, concerns the FRA's development activities.

<<4271.31;4277.14;en>>
Firstly, I would like to make it clear that the development activities are not unlimited in scope.

<<4277.14;4286.73;en>>
They are as rigorously regulated and subject to supervision to the same extent as signals intelligence in general.

<<4286.73;4301.53;en>>
The provisions applicable to foreign intelligence are also applicable to development activities, including the requirement for tasking directives from the government and the requirement of a permit from the Foreign Intelligence Court.

<<4301.53;4308.41;en>>
Signals intelligence development activities do not generate any intelligence reports.

<<4308.41;4314.41;en>>
The FRA's development activities are fundamentally different from its foreign intelligence activities.

<<4314.41;4327.22;en>>
The purpose of the development activities is to ensure that the FRA is in a position to fulfill its task to collect signals to the eight specific foreign intelligence purposes stated in law.

<<4327.22;4338.64;en>>
The FRA would not be able to perform its task within foreign intelligence if it could not develop and adjust its tools, systems, and methods.

<<4338.64;4349.81;en>>
In order to do so, it is vital for the FRA to monitor the ever-changing signals environment, technical developments, and signals protection.

<<4349.82;4354.34;en>>
The content of the traffic is not of interest for development activities.

<<4354.34;4361.34;en>>
Rather, it is the flow of traffic and the systems through which information is transmitted which are of interest.

<<4361.34;4373.22;en>>
For example, in its development activities, the FRA monitors the flow of traffic between certain countries in order to identify signals carriers with relevant traffic.

<<4373.22;4379.61;en>>
Another purpose is to identify trends such as new types of signals and signals protection.

<<4379.61;4394.06;en>>
Although the sole purpose of the development activities is to maintain and develop the FRA's foreign intelligence capabilities, it would be far too restrictive if the development activities were only allowed for the eight purposes stated in law.

<<4394.06;4404.68;en>>
This follows from the fact that each signal's intelligence mission, be it foreign intelligence or development activities, is tailored for its specific purpose, including as regards collection.

<<4404.68;4410.45;en>>
Consequently, Madam President, the FRA's statutory right to conduct development activities is essential.

<<4410.45;4414.93;en>>
But let me reiterate that it is not unlimited in scope.

<<4414.93;4423.34;en>>
This part of the FRA's mandate is subject to an equal level of regulation and supervision as its foreign intelligence work.

<<4423.34;4430.06;en>>
Finally, let me wrap up these observations by reiterating a few of my government's essential arguments.

<<4430.06;4437.06;en>>
As stated previously, signals intelligence is a necessity for the security of any modern democracy today.

<<4437.06;4441.06;en>>
Constitutional frameworks and legal systems vary between states.

<<4441.06;4446.73;en>>
States, as the court knows, face different national security challenges.

<<4446.73;4458.77;en>>
That is why my government invites the court to reaffirm that contracting states should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in choosing how best to achieve the legitimate aim of protecting national security.

<<4458.77;4471.22;en>>
For the same reasons, it's the hope of my government that when examining a signals intelligence system in abstracto, the court will continue to make an overall assessment of the whole system.

<<4471.22;4481.01;en>>
As for the signals intelligence within foreign intelligence conducted by the FRA, as I have stated, it is of crucial importance to Sweden's national security.

<<4481.01;4487.26;en>>
The intelligence obtained through this narrowly tailored intelligence instrument cannot be secured by any other reasonable means.

<<4490.22;4500.32;en>>
An overall assessment of the Swedish signals intelligence regime shows that the system provides adequate and sufficient guarantees against arbitrariness and the risk of abuse.

<<4500.32;4510.09;en>>
In conclusion, madam president, I invite the court to declare the complaint inadmissible or, in any event, to hold that the present case reveals no violation of the convention.

<<4510.09;4512.49;en>>
Madam President, distinguished members of the court, thank you.

[[JudgeP;Angelika Nußberger]]

<<4515.05;4517.39;en>>
Thank you for your submissions.

<<4517.39;4523.89;en>>
I now invite the judges of the Grand Chamber, wishing to do so, to put their questions to the parties.

<<4523.89;4524.89;en>>
Vice President Spano, please.

[[Judge;Robert Spano]]

<<4526.27;4529.45;en>>
Thank you very much, Madam President.

<<4529.45;4540.39;en>>
I would like to pose a question for clarification, mainly to the government, but I would, of course, invite the applicants to comment as well, if they so wish.

<<4540.39;4559.51;en>>
The chamber in this case, at the end of paragraph 139, said as follows, judicial supervision performed by the Foreign Intelligence Court is of crucial importance in that it limits the FRA's discretion by interpreting the scope of mandating and performing signals intelligence.

<<4559.51;4570.03;en>>
The applicants, of course, accept that the review process is important, but they claim before this court that it is, in any event, ineffective.

<<4570.03;4573.75;en>>
And they make arguments in support of that claim.

<<4573.75;4586.63;en>>
At paragraph 96 of the government's observations, it is stated that the FRA must submit an application for a permit in respect of each signal's intelligence mission.

<<4586.63;4605.31;en>>
And in its applications, the FRA must specify not only the collection assignment in question and the intelligence requirements, but also the signal carriers to which access is requested and the selectors, or at least the categories of selectors that will be used.

<<4605.31;4608.51;en>>
My clarification is as follows.

<<4608.51;4615.19;en>>
The judicial permit procedure, these are the words used by Mrs. Hammarskjöld,

<<4615.19;4622.71;en>>
this is a process of judicial permission at the outset, at the beginning of the process.

<<4622.71;4630.09;en>>
And I want you to correct me in your answer if I'm explaining this or understanding this incorrectly.

<<4630.09;4632.91;en>>
The FRA submits a request.

<<4632.91;4638.99;en>>
And in this request, you have these elements, but set forth in a rather generic manner.

<<4638.99;4641.51;en>>
For example, the types of selectors.

<<4641.51;4648.83;en>>
In other words, we will be using, for example, emails or communications type data, date and time, and so forth.

<<4648.83;4652.63;en>>
Subsequently, there is access to the data.

<<4652.63;4654.03;en>>
The logs are generated.

<<4654.03;4657.81;en>>
The analyst uses search terms.

<<4657.81;4665.31;en>>
That part of the process is not in any shape or form subject to judicial control.

<<4665.31;4669.59;en>>
That is after the Foreign Intelligence Court has come into play.

<<4669.59;4678.35;en>>
But it is, according to your submissions, subject to the ex post oversight of the inspectorate.

<<4678.35;4682.35;en>>
Am I understanding, in general, the way this works?

<<4682.35;4695.51;en>>
So the judicial warrant or the judicial permit procedure is simply a general request explicating, in general terms, what the mission is and what kinds of selectors are used.

<<4695.51;4695.51;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Angelika Nußberger]]

Judge Vehabović.

[[Judge;Faris Vehabović]]

<<4702.2;4703.2;en>>
Thank you.

<<4704.6;4706.26;en>>
I have one question.

<<4708.54;4721.54;en>>
Could you explain what is, pressure for the government, what is external communication for the purposes of collection of intelligence data?

<<4723.92;4742.0;en>>
And could you explain to me, is it, for example, Facebook communication or Instagram communication between two person in Sweden considered as external communication for the purposes of the law?

<<4744.66;4758.78;en>>
And if yes, does it mean that the position of the government is that external communication deserve less protection than internal communication?

<<4758.78;4759.78;en>>
Thank you.

Judge Pinto de Albuquerque.

[[Judge;Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque]]

<<4766.94;4767.98;en>>
Thank you.

<<4767.98;4772.94;en>>
Basically, I'm posing some of the questions that I raised this morning to both parties.

<<4778.38;4790.74;en>>
One of the questions, essential questions, are is the one relating to the criteria that the court has used in other similar cases.

<<4790.74;4798.26;en>>
And the position of the applicants is that the applicable criteria in this case is Zakharov.

<<4798.26;4803.26;en>>
Zakharov, and we should stick to Zakharov because it's a bulk interception case.

<<4803.26;4811.06;en>>
This is the position of the applicants both this morning and this afternoon.

<<4811.06;4821.7;en>>
This morning, the government replied saying, yes, Zakharov applies to bulk interception, bulk surveillance.

<<4821.7;4824.82;en>>
So my question is, what is the position of the respondent government?

<<4824.82;4828.5;en>>
Is Zakharov the authority in this field of law?

<<4828.5;4831.38;en>>
Does it apply to bulk surveillance or not?

<<4831.38;4835.42;en>>
And the criteria, the relevant criteria, you are aware, of course, of it.

<<4835.42;4842.18;en>>
It's paragraph 230 and 231 of Zakharov.

<<4842.18;4849.5;en>>
And with this in mind, I would make a specific question to the applicants.

<<4849.5;4871.52;en>>
Because the applicants say in their submissions that, and I'm quoting the applicants, in cases where there are no defined targets at the initial point of data collection, the authorizing body must nevertheless be required to meet a similar materiality or relevant threshold to use personal data as selectors.

<<4871.52;4875.14;en>>
So it's no longer reasonable suspicion.

<<4875.14;4877.26;en>>
It's the relevant threshold.

<<4877.26;4878.52;en>>
Could you elaborate on this?

<<4878.52;4879.58;en>>
What is this?

<<4879.58;4882.86;en>>
What is this, the relevance threshold?

<<4882.86;4890.14;en>>
Are you not departing from Zakharov, from your initial position of principle?

<<4890.14;4907.26;en>>
And this leads me to the second question, which is related to the separation, clear cut separation in Swedish law between criminal investigation and data collection for national security purposes.

<<4907.26;4909.54;en>>
My question is the following.

<<4909.54;4910.62;en>>
This is clear.

<<4910.62;4912.18;en>>
It results from the law.

<<4912.18;4921.82;en>>
But the fact is that since 2013, police and army have direct access to the FRA's database.

<<4921.82;4931.06;en>>
And in the near future, they can even have access in relation to events that are under ongoing criminal investigation.

<<4931.06;4932.3;en>>
And the question is this.

<<4932.3;4955.4;en>>
Are we not going into a slippery slope where gradually this instrument, which is basically an instrument of intelligence gathering, becoming effectively a domestic instrument of criminal investigation?

<<4955.4;4962.1;en>>
Third question is related to the status of the Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate.

<<4962.1;4973.66;en>>
It is composed of two former judges and four former politicians appointed by government, appointed and dismissed freely by government.

<<4973.66;4977.06;en>>
Is this a part-time job?

<<4977.06;4986.3;en>>
Is this, are these people supported by sufficient staff?

<<4986.3;4997.46;en>>
How do they work in terms of the means, the material, and human means available to them?

<<4997.46;5003.82;en>>
So I would like you to elaborate on the status of this Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate.

<<5003.82;5018.82;en>>
And this having in mind the criticism addressed by the Venice Commission report, paragraph 120 and 121, to the Swedish model.

<<5018.82;5020.14;en>>
Final question.

<<5020.14;5030.56;en>>
The United Nations Human Rights Committee report 2016 on Sweden reproached the Swedish intelligence gathering system.

<<5030.56;5031.74;en>>
My question is the following.

<<5031.74;5036.68;en>>
Has the government acted upon the recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Committee?

<<5036.68;5046.38;en>>
What was the reaction, the follow-up, given to this report of the United Nations Human Rights Committee 2016?

<<5046.38;5051.98;en>>
Ultimately, the question is the same put today to during the morning.

<<5051.98;5070.46;en>>
Is there a legal obligation in Swedish law to check whether foreign data recipients and data senders from non-council of Europe states to offer minimum safeguards equivalent to those of the convention?

<<5070.46;5070.9;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<5205.88;5207.0;en>>
Please be seated.

<<5212.2;5214.28;en>>
The hearing is resumed.

<<5214.28;5217.72;en>>
I call on Ms. Evans and Mr. Bergman for the applicant.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<5220.81;5224.77;en>>
Thank you, Madam President and members of the court.

<<5224.77;5240.34;en>>
I will start by addressing the question put by Judge Albuquerque to the applicant, and then I will comment on a few of the remarks made by the government in this case.

<<5240.34;5250.81;en>>
I will start with Judge Albuquerque's question regarding our position on the reasonable suspicion requirement laid out in Sakharov.

<<5250.81;5259.53;en>>
And firstly, I would like to confirm what Judge Albuquerque, how he interpreted our position.

<<5259.53;5273.69;en>>
And our position is that the grand chamber ruling in Sakharov is controlling in this case, but might be adapted to suit the particular challenges of both surveillance regime of this kind.

<<5273.69;5284.61;en>>
For instance, in our further written submissions, we argue, for instance, that prior judicial review should be a minimum safeguard acknowledged by the court.

<<5284.61;5294.69;en>>
But let me go back to the delicate issue of reasonable suspicion in this context.

<<5294.69;5314.34;en>>
And I would start by saying that there are a lot of different definitions and ways of describing what we are looking at here today, and we talk about targeted versus untargeted surveillance, we talk about strategic surveillance, we talk about signals intelligence, and these terms are not always helpful.

<<5314.34;5322.41;en>>
And I think that using the words targeted versus untargeted is not always helpful in this context.

<<5322.41;5346.49;en>>
As the court in its chamber judgment in Big Brother, the court said that bulk surveillance is by definition untargeted, and because of that, it would be incompatible to have a, it is by definition untargeted, and it is not possible then to have a requirement of reasonable suspicion.

<<5346.49;5352.17;en>>
And respectfully, we disagree with this position.

<<5352.17;5371.22;en>>
Whereas the government has acknowledged in their submissions to the grand chamber, in many cases, signals intelligence has to target specific individuals' communications, and this follows from paragraph 69 of the government's submission to the grand chamber.

<<5371.22;5377.97;en>>
Even though in many bulk surveillance missions, individuals are not targeted, sometimes they can be.

<<5377.97;5400.41;en>>
And it is in those circumstances that the applicant's position is that in order for the authorizing body to make a proper proportionality review of a bulk surveillance mission, it needs to take into consideration whether the individual targeted meets, there is a requirement of reasonable suspicion that is met.

<<5400.41;5428.38;en>>
And using reasonable suspicion in this context, which is not a law enforcement context, the reasonable suspicion requirement cannot be then in relation to any particular crime, but it can be in relation to reasonable suspicion that the person that is going to be targeted is engaged in activities that is of interest to national security, or has information relating to national security.

<<5428.38;5433.65;en>>
That is our general view on the reasonable suspicion requirement.

<<5433.65;5456.45;en>>
In cases where individuals are not targeted in a particular mission, but individualized search terms are used, then maybe a lower standard can be applied, for instance, like such a materiality requirement as we talk about in our written submissions.

<<5456.45;5468.61;en>>
But that is in cases where search terms relating to individuals are used without the individual being targeted.

<<5468.61;5481.15;en>>
And I would also like to comment in this context on what the government said about using a reasonable suspicion requirement, is that that would mix up law enforcement with national security.

<<5481.15;5496.67;en>>
But our position is that the reason a requirement of reasonable suspicion is used in the law enforcement context is not because an individual can invoke the protections of Article 8 in order to not be prosecuted for a crime.

<<5496.67;5503.99;en>>
The reason we have those procedural safeguards is because the right to privacy has an intrinsic value.

<<5503.99;5514.73;en>>
And that applies with equal strength in a bulk surveillance regime when the government wants to target individuals' communications.

<<5514.73;5541.3;en>>
Now a few points that the government has made, starting with the international cooperation point, where the applicant's view is that the Swedish legislation grants the government wide discretion to transfer data to third countries and to international organizations without any concern for the individual's rights under Article 8.

<<5541.3;5553.65;en>>
The government bases such a blanket exception on an interpretation of the European Council Data Convention, and we have disputed this interpretation.

<<5553.65;5563.53;en>>
The government also points to an internal document with the FRA, a single paper, as an additional safeguard against abuse.

<<5563.53;5581.05;en>>
And our position is that this crucial safeguard relating to when the FRA can transfer the bulk of data that they have intercepted to a third country or an international organization needs to be set out clearly in statute law.

<<5581.05;5593.69;en>>
It is not sufficient that the protections provided to the individual in these circumstances is done in an internal document that can be changed at any time.

<<5593.69;5601.01;en>>
A quick comment then on the government's position on when an interference occurs.

<<5601.01;5621.81;en>>
As we have heard, the government's position is that an interference into the applicant's Article 8 rights occurs at the stage where the data is selected for examination and reaches the point of human contact, not by the mere legislation itself.

<<5621.81;5643.51;en>>
And to the applicant, this position seems incompatible with the Court's established principles, first laid down in Klas, then reiterated in Kennedy, and then affirmed by the Grand Chamber in Sakharov, that the mere existence of a piece of legislation like this can constitute an interference with the applicant's rights.

<<5643.51;5654.09;en>>
And the Court has also confirmed that further interferences can occur at the time of storage, at the time of use, at the time of destruction, and transfer of data to other parties.

<<5654.09;5662.3;en>>
And this follows, for instance, from Weber at paragraph 79 and Liberty at paragraph 57.

<<5662.3;5670.81;en>>
The government, on the other hand, cites no support for its position.

<<5670.81;5680.41;en>>
The government also pointed out some misconceptions that the government claims the applicant has done.

<<5680.41;5699.57;en>>
And the government pointed out, the government claimed that the inspectorate, upon an application from an individual, whether unlawful activities have been conducted, has an obligation to inform the individual about its finding.

<<5699.57;5709.85;en>>
We would just like to draw the Court's attention to section 10A of the Signals Intelligence Act, which contain no such legal obligation on the inspectorate.

<<5709.85;5715.45;en>>
The inspectorate only has to notify the individual that an investigation has been carried out.

<<5715.45;5724.26;en>>
It's unclear what the inspectorate will do in case of a finding of unlawful activities, since it has never happened.

<<5724.26;5736.61;en>>
The government also claims that the Chancellor of Justice must act if it gets a report from the inspectorate that the state might have incurred liability for damages.

<<5736.61;5744.57;en>>
And it's correct that the Chancellor obviously needs to do something when he or she receives the report from the inspectorate.

<<5744.57;5755.07;en>>
But the point here is that the Chancellor of Justice is not bound by the determination of the inspectorate that an unlawful collection of processing has been conducted.

<<5755.07;5773.84;en>>
And the point relates to the fact that the inspectorate is not an effective oversight body, because it cannot itself make these legally binding decisions, which is necessary in order for them to be effective.

<<5773.84;5792.53;en>>
An oversight and remedial body needs to be able to render legally binding decisions with regard to stopping unlawful interception, to deleting information that has been collected unlawfully, and in appropriate cases, order redress and compensation.

<<5792.53;5796.81;en>>
And finally, a point that we – oh, sorry.

<<5796.81;5817.09;en>>
The final misconception was about whether the administrative court, which can be drawn into this situation of different reporting activities from the inspectorate, whether the administrative court in Stockholm may get full access to the documents at the FRA and the inspection.

<<5817.09;5826.95;en>>
And as far as the applicants have found, there is no such provision in Swedish law guaranteeing the court full access to those documents.

<<5826.95;5839.85;en>>
There are special provisions guaranteeing the inspectorate and the data protection authority full access, but no such provision in relation to the administrative court.

<<5839.85;5858.53;en>>
And then one final point that I also want to highlight is the fact that there is, in the Swedish system, basically no protection for the correspondence of legal persons.

<<5858.53;5874.77;en>>
Basically unfettered discretion on behalf of the government in collecting and using information relating to legal person and transferring that information to third countries and organizations.

<<5874.77;5896.77;en>>
One particular point, since the applicant is a law firm, a public interest law firm, defending individuals, holding the government accountable, is that the signals intelligence regime does not have any protection for privileged communications unless it is in a criminal situation.

<<5896.77;5914.31;en>>
I would like to draw the court's attention to section 7 of the signals intelligence act, where there is a duty on the FRA to destroy communications between a criminal suspect and his attorney, but not in any other privileged situation.

<<5914.31;5915.31;en>>
I would like to stop there.

<<5915.31;5915.31;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Angelika Nußberger]]

<<5916.77;5917.77;en>>
Thank you.

<<5917.77;5920.49;en>>
I call Ms. Hammarskjöld for the government.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<5922.86;5926.35;en>>
Thank you, Madam President, members of the court.

<<5926.35;5928.98;en>>
The court has posed a number of important questions.

<<5928.98;5933.7;en>>
I will try to address them in the order that they were posed to me.

<<5933.7;5943.59;en>>
And then I will, at the end, take a few moments to address a few of the arguments put forward by the applicant during today's hearing.

<<5943.59;5957.86;en>>
To turn firstly to the question posed by Judge Spano regarding the judicial permit process and its relationship to the chain leading all the way to logs.

<<5957.86;5968.02;en>>
Indeed, as you said, Judge Spano, the permit process is a judicial process at the beginning of the signals intelligence process.

<<5968.02;5980.31;en>>
The Foreign Intelligence Court decides on which level of detail their permit will be for each specific collection mission.

<<5980.31;5988.86;en>>
They also decide, of course, whether the FRA's application meets the requirements of the court in that instance.

<<5988.86;6009.98;en>>
The applications to the court include a detailed account of the need of the intelligence requirement, detailed information of the signal carriers and the selectors or categories of selectors relevant for the specific collection mission.

<<6009.98;6018.82;en>>
This is an example of how the Foreign Intelligence Court, in fact, determines the limits of the application of our legislation.

<<6018.82;6028.31;en>>
The logs at the analytical stage of the process are not subject to a decision by the court.

<<6028.31;6044.59;en>>
But I would like to recall what the government has put forward when it comes to the detailed supervision which the full process is subject to by the Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate and other bodies.

<<6047.51;6057.36;en>>
If I might then turn to the question by Judge Verhauwit regarding the distinction between external and internal terms.

<<6059.02;6065.98;en>>
The terminology itself, I think, is closer to the United Kingdom legal system than the Swedish one.

<<6065.98;6080.35;en>>
Under Swedish law, the scope of signals intelligence within foreign intelligence is focused on foreign circumstances, as we've outlined in our observations.

<<6080.35;6090.74;en>>
That means, in practice, that the aim is typically to collect, to process, and report intelligence on phenomena and circumstances in other countries.

<<6090.74;6103.62;en>>
So as to provide Swedish decision makers with better data for decisions and assessment on foreign security and defense policy, or to protect Swedish personnel participating in international operations.

<<6103.62;6109.51;en>>
That doesn't preclude, of course, that some of the foreign circumstances could have ramifications in Sweden.

<<6112.47;6126.47;en>>
I'll reiterate here that signals intelligence within foreign intelligence may only be conducted for the purposes stated in the Signals Intelligence Act, and that signals intelligence may not be conducted on domestic traffic within Sweden.

<<6130.02;6142.6;en>>
So to respond to your more specific question regarding a message on Facebook or Instagram, collection may not target signals between a sender and a recipient who are both situated in Sweden.

<<6145.66;6152.14;en>>
Sender-recipient normally would refer to natural persons who are communicating with each other.

<<6152.14;6165.32;en>>
And when a natural person communicates also with an automated service, the same reasoning would apply under Swedish law with respect to the significance of the geographic location of sender and recipient.

<<6165.32;6173.44;en>>
Also, because one is sometimes asked that question, when two persons in Sweden communicate, it doesn't matter which citizenship they have.

<<6173.44;6178.68;en>>
Their communication is not to be collected if it is domestic.

<<6178.68;6192.16;en>>
So the response would be that communication, be it via Facebook or Instagram, but in a domestic context, would not be collected.

<<6192.16;6214.05;en>>
I'd like now to turn, if I may, to the questions posed by Judge Pinto de Albuquerque, starting with the point on the position of my government when it comes to the Zakharov criteria, as specified in paragraph 231 of the judgment.

<<6214.05;6233.4;en>>
It is our position that those criteria do apply to signals intelligence regimes, but with a minor adaptation, which is motivated by the fact that the criteria have essentially been developed in case law concerning secret measures of surveillance in criminal investigations.

<<6233.4;6242.24;en>>
And here I would refer to paragraph 68 to 72 of the government's observations of May this year.

<<6246.36;6254.76;en>>
It is, of course, also our position that it does not follow from the Zakharov judgment that there would be any requirement of reasonable suspicion.

<<6254.76;6275.56;en>>
Judge Pinto de Albuquerque, you also asked the question, is there a risk when it comes to the delimitation between signals intelligence within foreign intelligence and criminal investigation that there could be a slippery slope in the Swedish system?

<<6275.56;6280.44;en>>
And I would respectfully say no.

<<6280.44;6285.12;en>>
And I would respectfully say no.

<<6285.12;6293.16;en>>
The legislation is absolutely clear on the delimitation between the two.

<<6293.16;6297.64;en>>
And as I outlined earlier, there are consequences linked to that delimitation.

<<6300.93;6319.16;en>>
The Swedish Security Service and the NOA may issue detailed tasking directives for signals intelligence, but they may not do so for the purpose of investigating criminal activities.

<<6319.16;6327.24;en>>
So according to my government, the legislation draws a very clear line between foreign intelligence and law enforcement.

<<6327.24;6341.52;en>>
And while the Swedish Security Service may, in some instances, be granted direct access to some data, this possibility is very limited.

<<6341.52;6346.97;en>>
And here I would refer you to paragraph 117, appendix 1, of our observations.

<<6357.05;6382.2;en>>
I was then asked the question about the role of the inspectorate and the position of the judges within the personnel and staffing regulations, which are there.

<<6382.2;6401.28;en>>
It is correct to say that the foreign intelligence inspectorate consists of a board, an office, which is described in the annual report, which we have submitted to the court.

<<6401.28;6415.56;en>>
The foreign intelligence inspectorate is led by a board who, as you referred to, are appointed by the government on terms of at least four years.

<<6415.56;6422.6;en>>
The vice president shall be or have been permanent judges.

<<6422.6;6428.85;en>>
Other members are selected from candidates proposed by party groups in the parliament.

<<6428.85;6445.05;en>>
It is correct to say that they work part time, but it would be equally correct to say that they work the time that is necessary to fulfill the supervisory duties which the inspectorate is assigned.

<<6445.05;6453.81;en>>
There is a supporting office to back up that, the work of the inspectorate.

<<6453.81;6462.94;en>>
And I would refer the court here to the annual report, which describes more about the working methods of the court in this respect.

<<6468.64;6503.48;en>>
With regard to the question related to the report of the Human Rights Committee of 2016, while that report did not lead to any specific decisions with regard to the system for signals intelligence, I hope that my government has demonstrated to the court that the whole Swedish signals intelligence regime is constantly subject to scrutiny and review by independent bodies who report on their findings.

<<6503.48;6511.81;en>>
So there is a constant process of looking at how the system works and how the safeguards that are within it truly function.

<<6517.6;6535.89;en>>
If I might then turn to the question with regard to international cooperation sharing data with countries outside the community of Council of Europe countries.

<<6535.89;6545.93;en>>
Firstly, to state again that international cooperation is regulated in law, and it is conducted in accordance with specific instructions from the government.

<<6545.93;6562.12;en>>
If I were to turn first to data going out from Sweden under that form of international cooperation, FRA guidelines require that international partners respect Swedish regulations.

<<6562.12;6573.78;en>>
We also have both training and information to partners regarding what that actually entails in terms of the content of Swedish legislation.

<<6573.78;6585.05;en>>
For the sake of completeness, I'll also make a comment on data coming in, although that issue is essentially outside the scope of the examination by the ground chamber.

<<6585.05;6600.68;en>>
But just to complement what has been said previously, that the internal regulations of the FRA state that those regulations also apply to material received from foreign partners.

<<6600.68;6609.81;en>>
Incoming is subject to the same regulation as data collected by the FRA itself.

<<6609.81;6622.18;en>>
And finally, on this point, does it actually work to reiterate to the court that the full functioning of this system is subject to oversight?

<<6622.18;6634.2;en>>
And I refer here to appendix 1, paras 118 to 121, and other parts of our previous observations.

<<6634.2;6650.24;en>>
With the indulgence of the court, I might now just briefly turn to a couple of comments related to statements made in the observations by the applicant today.

<<6650.24;6666.36;en>>
The first point I'd like to make is the applicant continued to make the point, the claim, that the Swedish signals intelligence regime is one of mass surveillance.

<<6666.36;6679.36;en>>
It is a narrowly tailored system subject to law, subject to judicial decision making, subject to oversight, subject to follow up.

<<6679.36;6685.93;en>>
Explicitly designed to include the safeguards that the convention requires of us.

<<6685.93;6700.24;en>>
And I would invite the court here to, as the third chamber did, conclude that there is no violation of the convention in this regard.

<<6700.24;6706.23;en>>
On a more specific point, if I might turn to the issue of data protection for legal persons.

<<6706.23;6710.6;en>>
Personal data always refers to an individual.

<<6710.6;6722.09;en>>
And so there isn't, therefore, the need, from an integrity perspective, for a legal person to have an equivalent kind of remedy.

<<6722.09;6732.01;en>>
But I hope that I have been able to give the court the broader picture of the full range of how the system of oversight and scrutiny works, also in this regard.

<<6732.01;6736.6;en>>
Thank you, Your Honor.

<<6736.6;6738.52;en>>
Just to make a couple of final points.

<<6744.24;6750.93;en>>
The signals intelligence within foreign intelligence has specific purposes set out in law.

<<6754.36;6766.64;en>>
It meets, as I've said previously, the necessity for the security of Sweden as of any other modern democracy today.

<<6766.64;6784.89;en>>
The positive obligation that Sweden as a contracting state and other contracting states has to protect the lives and safety of the public is an essential fundament in the totality of why this system is necessary.

<<6784.89;6824.44;en>>
And while recognizing that there is every need to prevent the public from abuse and to have safeguards in place, my government would argue that the remedies and the safeguards the Swedish system includes are effective and robust, as found by the third chamber, and one which does provide the protection that could be expected in a system governed by the convention.

<<6824.44;6824.44;en>>
Thank you very much.

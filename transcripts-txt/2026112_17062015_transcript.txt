La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Luis López Guerra]]

<<64.08;71.08;en>>
Good morning. I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of Baka v. Hungary.

<<71.08;84.82;en>>
The application was lodged with the Court on 14 March 2012 under Article 34 of the Convention by a Hungarian national, Mr. András Baka. The application was allocated to the second

<<84.82;91.38;en>>
section of the Court pursuant to Rule 52, Paragraph 1 of the Rules of the Court. On

<<91.38;100.3;en>>
27 May 2014, a chamber of the second section delivered its judgment in the case. On 27

<<100.3;122.2;en>>
August 2014, the Government requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention, and the panel of the Grand Chamber accepted the request of 15 December 2014. On 5 March 2013, the President of the second section

<<122.2;143.7;en>>
granted leave to the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, the Hungarian Civil Liberty Union, the Eötvös Karolyi Institute and the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, based in Poland, to submit written comments under Rule 44, Paragraph 3 of the Rules of the Court. On 11 March 2015,

<<143.7;155.26;en>>
the President of the Grand Chamber granted leave to the International Commission of Jurists to submit written comments under Rule 44, Paragraph 3 of the Rules of the Court. The

<<155.26;162.46;en>>
Government is represented by the agent, Mr. Zoltán Tallódi, assisted by Mrs. Mónika Weller,

<<162.46;168.9;en>>
co-agent. The applicant is represented by his counsel, Mr. András Cech, assisted by

<<168.9;178.78;en>>
Mr. Erik Látrányi, advisor. I welcome the representative in the name of the Court. I also welcome a

<<178.78;190.86;en>>
delegation of judges, including its President from the Court of Cassation of Armenia, a delegation of Ukrainian judges and a delegation of French judges. Having consulted the agent

<<190.86;201.7;en>>
of the Government and the representatives of the applicant, I have determined the order of addresses as follows. First, Mr. Cech, for the applicant, will speak first, and then

<<201.7;208.7;en>>
Mr. Tallódi will speak for the Government. I will explain that, in addition to interpreting

<<208.7;226.02;en>>
in the two official languages of the Court, English and French, interpreting into Russian and Armenian has been authorised for the benefit of the groups of judges from Ukraine and Armenia attending this hearing. That interpreting is not arranged by the Court, and no transcription

<<226.02;231.38;en>>
of the oral translation will be included in the official record of the proceedings. I

<<231.38;232.38;en>>
call Mr. Cech to the floor.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<238.42;241.62;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<241.62;247.5;en>>
it is a great privilege to appear before you this morning representing the applicant, Mr. Baka,

<<247.5;251.62;en>>
the former president of the Supreme Court of Hungary.

<<251.62;264.1;en>>
When I give a brief outline of the applicant's position in this highly unusual case, let me start with quoting the first sentences of his letter, which was sent to the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr. Orbán.

<<264.1;277.9;en>>
In states governed by the rule of law, the role of the president of the Supreme Court and that of the persons in charge of court administration consists in performing their specialized professional everyday duties.

<<277.9;286.74;en>>
It is under very special circumstances only that they have to raise their voice to protect independence of the courts and judges.

<<286.74;300.82;en>>
Indeed, such an exceptional situation arose in 2011 in Hungary, when the applicant felt obliged to speak up on account of four issues vitally affecting the judicial system.

<<300.82;307.14;en>>
Firstly, he called into question the bill of the so-called Nullification Act.

<<307.14;314.78;en>>
This act ordered reopening final judgments delivered in relation to crowd dispersion in autumn 2006.

<<314.78;330.06;en>>
The applicant criticized the manner in which the goal of the act would be achieved, namely reopening final judgments, denying free assessment of evidence, and annulling judicial decisions by the force of law.

<<330.06;333.66;en>>
This legislation also set an alarming precedent.

<<333.66;344.7;en>>
If a political force orders reopening a group of already closed cases that it dislikes, other political forces could do the same with other final judgments.

<<344.7;354.82;en>>
In response to these concerns, he got hostile reaction from the side of the ruling forces, denying that final judgments would be bind the legislator.

<<354.82;367.1;en>>
This court hardly needs to be reminded of the principles of separation of powers and of legal certainty, which involve that even the legislator shall be bound by final judgments.

<<367.1;384.1;en>>
The second issue which provoked shock and protest was the drastic reduction of the retirement age of judges by eight years that resulted in the forced and immediate retirement of 1 10th of the judiciary, affecting mainly senior high court and Supreme Court judges.

<<384.1;392.54;en>>
This rule was adopted after only nine days of parliamentary debate without any consultation of the judiciary.

<<392.54;397.34;en>>
As a result, the reaction was unanimous amongst judges.

<<397.34;410.3;en>>
The plenary session of the Supreme Court, the National Judicial Council, as well as the presidents of regional and county courts addressed the communique to the Hungarian and European Union public.

<<410.3;418.14;en>>
They argued for the autonomy and independence of the judiciary by criticizing the new mandatory retirement age.

<<418.14;432.62;en>>
As I mentioned, the applicant wrote an official letter to the prime minister, too, urging him to use his influence and to make every possible effort to prevent parliament from adopting the proposal.

<<432.62;443.02;en>>
However, despite all criticism, the rules have been incorporated into the new constitution, excluding thereby any scrutiny by the constitutional court.

<<443.02;452.56;en>>
When considering the applicant's activity in the matter at hand, please note that he was not directly affected by the sudden reduction of the age limit.

<<452.56;460.9;en>>
The third issue of this agreement related to the constitutionality of the amendment of the Code on Criminal Procedure.

<<460.9;470.74;en>>
This act empowered the chief prosecutor to depart from statutory rules of jurisdiction and cherry pick a court when lodging an indictment.

<<470.74;484.22;en>>
The new regulation extended from three days to five the maximum period of detention without bringing the detainee before a judge, grossly neglecting this way the jurisprudence under Article 5.3

<<484.22;486.14;en>>
of the convention.

<<486.14;497.04;en>>
In cases of great importance, the new law prohibited all exchanges between the defendant and his or her counsel for the first two days of the detention.

<<497.04;512.74;en>>
For these reasons, the applicant, as chief justice, decided for the first time in the Hungarian legal history to turn to the constitutional court, which eventually established the unconstitutionality of the impugned provisions and therefore quashed them.

<<512.74;530.9;en>>
It is noteworthy that as a response to this decision, the disavowed provisions concerning the chief prosecutor's right to establish extra court competence was nevertheless reenacted in the new constitution, thereby immunizing it from further constitutional examination.

<<530.9;537.26;en>>
Lastly, the applicant spoke up in the parliamentary debate on the new cardinal acts on the judiciary.

<<537.26;545.62;en>>
He sent a detailed analysis of the bills to parliament, taking account of the comments received from judges throughout the country.

<<545.62;554.86;en>>
Then, as no reaction received, he decided to express his opinion directly before the parliament in accordance with the pertinent rules.

<<554.86;574.24;en>>
In his speech, the applicant criticized mostly the fact that the collective decision-making power of the National Judicial Council was conferred to a single politically appointed chief executive of the court administration, who got excessive and in Europe unprecedented powers without any accountability.

<<579.3;594.5;en>>
We invite the court to bear in mind that the applicant, being the head of the judiciary, was under an explicit statutory obligation to express opinion on parliamentary draft legislations affecting the judiciary.

<<594.5;602.34;en>>
The concerns he raised were not his isolated ideas, but reflected the previously surveyed standpoint of the members of the judiciary.

<<602.34;611.9;en>>
The legal issues at stake were of high importance, as they affected fundamental matters, principally the basic institutions and judicial independence.

<<611.9;637.62;en>>
They were so relevant that even the organs of the Council of Europe, like the monitoring committee of the Parliamentary Assembly and the Venice Commission, and European Ombudsman, the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Human Rights Watch, Chief Justices of the European Union, and different organizations of judges and lawyers from other countries, or even foreign governments, expressed their concern and disagreement.

<<637.62;644.5;en>>
These critical views of the applicant were fully shared and repeated by these organizations.

<<644.5;652.86;en>>
What is more, the European Court of Justice also condemned Hungary on account of the forced early retirement of judges.

<<652.86;660.9;en>>
As a consequence of the harsh international criticism and pressure, the Hungarian government had to change the relevant legislation.

<<660.9;666.14;en>>
However, they changed them to the minimum extent.

<<666.14;671.5;en>>
As a consequence of these interventions, the applicant has been removed from office.

<<671.5;682.34;en>>
The removal was carried out despite the government having consistently denied that the new laws on judiciary would entail the termination of the applicant's term of office.

<<682.34;690.02;en>>
They even assured the Venice Commission that the applicant would continue his term as president of the Courier.

<<690.02;715.18;en>>
In the face of all that, the applicant was not only removed, which necessarily involved the loss of his actual entitlements, but nine days later, by a personalized legislative provision, he has also been fully deprived of all his post-term presidential benefits, including presidential pension, which would have been due to him automatically after termination of office.

<<715.18;723.24;en>>
Please bear in mind that the applicant's case is by far not an isolated example of the personalized legislation.

<<723.24;733.62;en>>
Since 2010, it has been a common practice of the ruling forces to resolve particular situations by taking individual measures in form of legal provisions.

<<733.62;741.54;en>>
Dozens of different, so to say, problems were already resolved by means of tailor-made legislation.

<<741.54;749.14;en>>
The Hungarian third party intervener gave a comprehensive review of this practice, which is without example in Europe.

<<749.14;758.12;en>>
It is based upon a sweeping parliamentary majority, which votes all government proposals with military discipline.

<<758.12;766.02;en>>
Turning to the complaint under Article VI, we are convinced that the chamber rightly established the applicability of this article.

<<766.02;778.42;en>>
As a preliminary remark, let me remind you that in our written submission, we quoted a series of access to court cases where this court has applied the Eskalinan test.

<<778.42;786.02;en>>
Therefore, the government's objection suggesting the inapplicability of this test to the right of access cases must be deemed simply outdated.

<<788.66;803.5;en>>
This court, in the case of Vilho Eskalinan and others versus Finland, established a presumption that Article VI applies to employment disputes involving civil servants unless the following two conditions are fulfilled.

<<803.5;812.02;en>>
Firstly, the state in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the postal category of staff in question.

<<812.02;818.54;en>>
Secondly, this exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the state's interest.

<<818.54;828.54;en>>
As far as the first criterion is concerned, according to the well-established Strasbourg case law, it must be interpreted strictly.

<<828.54;834.58;en>>
Only a clear and express exclusion may warrant the inapplicability of Article VI.

<<834.58;840.14;en>>
By contrast, in Hungarian law, there was no such provision.

<<840.14;847.1;en>>
Furthermore, this exclusion must affect a certain post or category of staff in an abstract manner.

<<847.1;861.22;en>>
But the legislative act in question, which terminated the ongoing mandate of the Chief Justice, was applicable only to one person at a given moment, notably the applicant alone.

<<861.22;867.5;en>>
Therefore, it did not treat this post generally, nor any other category of staff.

<<867.5;876.18;en>>
What is more, the applicant's right of access to court, rather than being excluded, was guaranteed by plain terms.

<<876.18;878.82;en>>
The text of the law is clear.

<<878.82;891.3;en>>
All judges, court executives, including court presidents without exception, were vested with the right to bring an action before the service tribunal in order to contest their dismissal.

<<891.3;899.58;en>>
This explicit right of the applicant was eventually precluded by the enactment of his dismissal into the Constitution.

<<899.58;905.7;en>>
Consequently, the government failed to prove the fulfillment of the first condition of the Eskalinan test.

<<905.7;912.98;en>>
And this would in itself be sufficient to conclude to the applicability of Article VI.

<<912.98;924.86;en>>
But even assuming that such a legal ground existed, it wouldn't have been justified on objective grounds in the state's interest either.

<<924.86;938.14;en>>
Our firm assessment is that the government did not specify any objective ground in the present case that could justify the exclusion of the applicant's right of access to court.

<<938.14;944.22;en>>
They placed great reliance on the court's finding in the first Harabin decision in 2002.

<<944.22;949.22;en>>
However, this decision has been outdated by the Eskalinan judgment.

<<949.22;960.74;en>>
According to the subsequent case law, the very nature of the applicant's position in itself cannot justify any exclusion of access to a court in respect of dismissal.

<<960.74;973.78;en>>
The government also drew a parallel between the applicant and the public prosecutors who exercise discretionary powers intrinsic to state sovereignty that justifies the exclusion of their right of access to court.

<<973.78;976.14;en>>
But this approach is not correct.

<<976.14;983.46;en>>
We share more of the opinion set forth in the excellent summary of the third party intervener international commission of jurists.

<<983.46;997.18;en>>
We do believe that the power exercised by a judge, although essentially of a public nature, is both structurally and inherently distinct from that of public servants of the executive.

<<997.18;1006.5;en>>
Judges, unlike other public officials, enjoy specific guarantees due to the requirement of judicial independence.

<<1006.5;1020.0;en>>
In addition, although the applicant as the highest judicial office holder performed some special tasks from the perspective of the separation of powers, his role was substantially no different from other judges and court executives.

<<1020.0;1030.84;en>>
He did not have a stronger bond of trust and loyalty with the state than his colleagues and fellow court executives, whose right of access to court is not disputed by the respondent state.

<<1030.84;1034.56;en>>
He shared the very same judicial independence.

<<1034.56;1049.94;en>>
The conclusion may be drawn that the applicant's legal status did not involve any special exercise of discretionary powers intrinsic to state sovereignty to the extent that would justify the exclusion of his access to court as regards his removal.

<<1049.94;1058.04;en>>
But again, his access to court, rather than being excluded, was clearly guaranteed by the domestic law.

<<1058.04;1068.12;en>>
We invite, therefore, the court to hold that Article VI applies in the present case and has been violated on account of the applicant's deprival of his right of access to tribunal.

<<1072.36;1088.82;en>>
Turning now to Article X, the government insists that there was no interference with the applicant's freedom of expression since his term of office was terminated because of the fundamental changes in the functions of the supreme judicial authority in Hungary.

<<1088.82;1092.98;en>>
But this argument hardly seems to be persuasive.

<<1092.98;1114.38;en>>
Firstly, because this argument emerged no sooner than in the respondent state written submission in the present case, before and during the legislation process, and even afterwards, no official or non-official declaration was put forward explaining the applicant's removal by any fundamental structural changes.

<<1114.38;1131.34;en>>
Secondly, at the material time, I mean in the course of events, dozens of articles, declarations, and opinions, both in Hungary and abroad, raised the issue of a clear causal link between the applicant's utterances and his removal.

<<1131.34;1137.46;en>>
In contrast to that, the government didn't even try to confute this general opinion.

<<1137.46;1148.78;en>>
Certainly, had the real motive been different, the government would have paid the utmost attention to dispel the guise and suspicion by communicating their arguments.

<<1148.78;1162.58;en>>
Thirdly, it is legitimate to raise the question, once an organization goes through as dramatic changes as the government suggests, why only its head must be removed?

<<1162.58;1176.98;en>>
What is more, why did this person become immediately excluded by a newly introduced criterion from being even a candidate to the presidency of the new legal successor institution?

<<1176.98;1183.3;en>>
This gave rise to a suspicion that an individual measure was made.

<<1183.3;1198.14;en>>
And this suspicion is even more substantiated if the removal of that specific person is accompanied by the immediate and total abrogation of his legal post-term benefits.

<<1198.14;1206.54;en>>
The government and the applicant have a dispute whether there has been a fundamental change in the structure and functions of the Supreme Judicial Authority.

<<1206.54;1212.46;en>>
Based on the written material provided, we do assert that there weren't any substantial changes.

<<1212.46;1219.9;en>>
And the Curia is not a new judicial body in Hungary, but is nothing else than the Supreme Court renamed.

<<1219.9;1224.22;en>>
That is to say, it remains the Supreme Judicial Authority of the country.

<<1224.22;1234.74;en>>
The government, in turn, rely on two new competencies, which, in their view, changed fundamentally its functions.

<<1234.74;1237.82;en>>
However, it is not convincing at all.

<<1237.82;1243.86;en>>
Firstly, because securing unity of the jurisprudence is not at all a new competence.

<<1243.86;1249.74;en>>
It had been one of the Supreme Court's tasks ever since its existence.

<<1249.74;1266.3;en>>
Secondly, the only new competence, namely, supervising local government legislation, does not mean more than merely about 60 to 70 new cases amongst around 8,000 cases arriving yearly to the Curia.

<<1266.3;1273.06;en>>
A similarly marginal change would surely not justify the termination of the mandate of any court president.

<<1273.06;1283.56;en>>
In addition, all other judges and court executives of the Supreme Court, with the exception of the vice president, the trustee of the applicant, remained in office.

<<1283.56;1289.24;en>>
And pending cases were to be handled by the same chambers without any change.

<<1289.24;1307.86;en>>
We don't ask this court to take a stand to qualify the nature of these changes, because even assuming that the Supreme Court and the Curia were different in terms of their organization and structure, those two bodies are, in a sense, entrusted with identical tasks.

<<1307.86;1314.86;en>>
For this reason, a mere change in the institutional model cannot justify the premature removal of the applicant.

<<1314.86;1326.66;en>>
Moreover, even in case of such a change, transitional measures should have entrusted the applicant the possibility to serve his term of office in full.

<<1326.66;1337.5;en>>
I emphasize again, as we did in paragraph 49 of our memorial, the rulings of the European Court of Justice in the case of Hungarian data protection supervisor.

<<1337.5;1347.34;en>>
In that case, the Luxembourg court clearly stated that member states were free to adopt or amend the institutional model.

<<1347.34;1359.38;en>>
However, they had to ensure the independence of the supervisory authority, which entails the obligation to allow the supervisor to serve its full term office.

<<1359.38;1368.54;en>>
This principled ruling on the required security of tenure shall a fortiori be applicable to a Supreme Court president.

<<1368.54;1380.06;en>>
Consequently, the argument of the government referring to the structural changes in the Supreme Court's functions cannot in any case justify the premature termination of the applicant's mandate.

<<1383.78;1387.22;en>>
Mr. President, honorable judges, the government

<<1387.22;1392.74;en>>
tried to sell the idea that the applicant was not suitable to lead the courier.

<<1392.74;1396.06;en>>
That was the reason why he had been dismissed.

<<1396.06;1404.42;en>>
Additionally, in their memorial, they attempt to undermine the high moral standing and the competency of the applicant.

<<1404.42;1409.18;en>>
I'm not going to follow the government on that disgraceful avenue.

<<1409.18;1418.9;en>>
I would simply remind you that the applicant's professional qualities and his ability have never been called into question during his term of office.

<<1418.9;1424.14;en>>
Whatever the respondent government may say, the facts speak for themselves.

<<1424.14;1438.94;en>>
Notably, the applicant was elected and twice re-elected to a high international judicial position under three different governments, both left and right wings, including the first cabinet of the present prime minister.

<<1438.94;1453.78;en>>
Then he was elected with the support of the competent judicial authority, president of the Supreme Court, for a six-year term by an 86% parliamentary majority, also including the current governing parties.

<<1453.78;1460.82;en>>
The pity political games the parties played around his election fall outside of the applicant's responsibility.

<<1460.82;1472.9;en>>
What is more, in 2011, he was unanimously elected for president of the network of the presidents of the Supreme Judicial Courts of the European Union.

<<1472.9;1480.06;en>>
And in 2012, he has been elected as honorary president of this network.

<<1480.06;1492.94;en>>
Given the reality, when the government suggests that the applicant was not suitable for his position, we are persuaded that this suitability must be understood politically rather than professionally.

<<1492.94;1509.54;en>>
This interpretation is completely confirmed by the shocking content of paragraph 44 of the government's memorial, where they made it clear that they considered the applicant's position as a political function and the applicant as a political actor.

<<1509.54;1515.62;en>>
Moreover, they considered themselves as the employer of the head of judiciary.

<<1515.62;1523.58;en>>
The government didn't left the slightest doubt that they regard the applicant's expressions as political expressions.

<<1523.58;1525.02;en>>
They cannot stand.

<<1525.02;1532.66;en>>
And therefore, the removal from office was the consequence of purely political considerations.

<<1532.66;1540.38;en>>
Honorable members of the court, no doubt that the respondent state interfered with the applicant's freedom of expression.

<<1540.38;1552.46;en>>
This interference, however, wasn't prescribed by law because tailor-made abusive legislation cannot ever satisfy the conventional requirements as to the quality of law.

<<1552.46;1562.26;en>>
Furthermore, its aim was to sanction the applicant for simply fulfilling his duty to express opinion on judicial matters.

<<1562.26;1566.22;en>>
This aim cannot be recognized as legitimate.

<<1566.22;1574.62;en>>
What is more, the necessity of such interference is hardly explicable in a democratic society.

<<1574.62;1583.68;en>>
This court held in the Hendyside case that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society.

<<1583.68;1598.5;en>>
It is important to underline that expression of the applicant's views was not for his personal benefit at all, but had a more general purpose, protecting the independence and the proper functioning of the judiciary.

<<1598.5;1608.62;en>>
The issues concerning the functioning of the justice system constitute questions of public interest, a debate of which enjoys the protection of Article 10.

<<1608.62;1615.78;en>>
In response to this criticism, punitive measures of interference have been adopted against the applicant.

<<1615.78;1627.98;en>>
Moreover, this court cannot ignore the chilling effect of these measures on the exercise of freedom of expression by other independent high officials and the whole judiciary.

<<1627.98;1635.06;en>>
The applicant formulated his arguments in order to protect the very basics of the rule of law.

<<1635.06;1644.78;en>>
Those state measures that operate against such an activity cannot ever be regarded as necessary in a democratic society.

<<1644.78;1650.22;en>>
As a final observation, let me turn to the issue of the just satisfaction.

<<1650.22;1660.58;en>>
We have to be clear at this point by saying that the applicant's claims under Article 41 are the direct consequences of the violation of Article 10 of the Convention.

<<1660.58;1677.9;en>>
Namely, in reprisal for the views he expressed, the applicant's term of office was terminated, and as an additional punishment, all of his statutory guaranteed post-term entitlements were abolished with extreme rapidity.

<<1677.9;1683.22;en>>
These measures constitute together a single punitive package.

<<1683.22;1689.7;en>>
This package of sanctions was a direct consequence of the applicant's utterances.

<<1689.7;1708.3;en>>
Since the 13 Turkish Grand Chamber cases of 1999, this court has repeatedly recognized that even eventual finding of a violation of Article 10 necessarily entails the reparation of all damages which are direct consequences of it.

<<1708.3;1711.34;en>>
My client was penalized by two kinds of sanctions.

<<1711.34;1722.06;en>>
He was removed from his position, entailing the loss of his presidential remunerations, and was deprived of his lawful post-term benefits.

<<1722.06;1727.26;en>>
I see no reason in the present case to depart from the well-established case law.

<<1727.26;1734.18;en>>
Consequently, both losses need to be reimbursed as pecuniary damages suffered by the applicant.

<<1734.18;1747.3;en>>
It is important to note that the provision regulating the applicant's before-mentioned entitlements were basic elements of his statutory service conditions.

<<1747.3;1756.76;en>>
These conditions were already in force at the time of his appointment and remained unchanged until he was removed.

<<1756.76;1767.98;en>>
In addition, the applicant fulfilled all criteria for the disbursement of all his entitlements so that their implementation would have been automated.

<<1767.98;1773.9;en>>
The amount claimed for damages is not speculative, but based on precise legal provisions.

<<1776.86;1782.62;en>>
The retroactive abrogation of the post-term benefits affected only the applicant.

<<1782.62;1796.5;en>>
We enclosed to our memorial under Annex 8 a table which clearly shows that all public officials falling under the same law are still receiving their statutory post-term remunerations.

<<1796.5;1819.74;en>>
It is worth noting that the period of office of these former officials terminated before 1st of January 2012, similarly to the applicant, and all of them have obtained their post-term office entitlements, including their pensions, even if they reach the pensionable age long after granting the force of the new rules in 2012.

<<1819.74;1824.42;en>>
The applicant is the only exception.

<<1824.42;1848.5;en>>
The before-mentioned factual elements supported by scores of evidences led to the conclusion that the applicant's retroactive deprivation of his remuneration and other benefits simultaneously with his dismissal was not only a matter of coincidence, but the result of a last-minute legislative measure tailored to him alone.

<<1848.5;1858.18;en>>
They followed a purely punitive purpose, that is, the retaliation for the applicant's persisting and principled criticism.

<<1858.18;1868.42;en>>
The resulting pecuniary damage as a direct consequence is thus inextricably linked to the breach of the applicant's rights under Article 10 of the Convention.

<<1868.42;1872.62;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<1872.62;1902.42;en>>
international organizations listed in our memorial have already taken a firm stance declaring that measures concerning the termination of the applicant's term of office, and I'm quoting here, are widely seen as being solely adopted to dismiss the sitting president of the Supreme Court and are considered as an attempt to get rid of a specific person who in the past had been critical of the government's policy of judicial reform.

<<1902.42;1916.14;en>>
They all agree that this dismissal, a kind of sanction, was politically motivated and violates the guarantee of security of tenure, which is a key element of the independence of the judiciary.

<<1916.14;1919.92;en>>
We share these opinions and the principles behind them.

<<1919.92;1931.82;en>>
We strongly believe that political demands on the judiciary and evaluation of judges by political standards may never come back again in Europe.

<<1931.82;1941.8;en>>
On this basis, we respectfully request the court to hold that there has been a violation of the invoked provisions of the Convention.

<<1941.8;1942.66;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

[[JudgeP;Luis López Guerra]]

<<1944.3;1948.3;en>>
Thank you Mr. Cech. Now I call Mr. Tallódi to the floor.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<1953.59;1955.43;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<1955.43;1957.95;en>>
Mr. President, honorable members of the court,

<<1957.95;1968.59;en>>
ladies and gentlemen, it's a privilege and a pleasure to have the opportunity to appear before the court to present the oral submissions on behalf of the government of Hungary.

<<1968.59;1973.43;en>>
Since for a long time, this is the first case from Hungary heard by the court.

<<1973.43;1980.91;en>>
I avail myself of this opportunity to express to the court the highest respect of my government.

<<1980.91;1993.03;en>>
Concerning the present case, it can be stated that during the written procedure before the court, both parties have been given ample opportunity to put forward their arguments.

<<1993.03;2006.15;en>>
Hence, it is not necessary to repeat now the details of the position of the government outlined recently in the memorial of the 8th of April, 2015.

<<2006.15;2011.15;en>>
I will rather focus on the most important issues raised by the case.

<<2011.15;2037.79;en>>
First of all, let me reaffirm that the government, similarly to the intervening third parties, consider that the independence of the judiciary is an important guarantee of the rule of law, which principle is clearly enshrined in the fundamental law of Hungary and which was fully taken into account in drafting and amending the new laws governing the organization of the judicial system in Hungary.

<<2037.79;2053.03;en>>
In fact, the provision itself, which made the applicant ineligible to be elected as president of the Courier, was introduced in order to increase the independence of the judiciary in accordance with the proposal of Hungarian judges.

<<2053.03;2059.43;en>>
With due respect to the applicant's professional achievements, Mr. Darak's professional qualities and achievements

<<2059.43;2079.99;en>>
were presented in the government's memorial in order to show that the new president of the Courier is a renowned judge of excellent professional qualities and to dissipate any doubts as to his suitability to personify the independence of the judiciary.

<<2079.99;2089.75;en>>
The government considered that the circumstances of the applicant's election as president of the Supreme Court are crucial to understanding the case.

<<2089.75;2098.11;en>>
Therefore, I briefly describe those circumstances and the nature of the functions the applicant was elected for.

<<2098.11;2106.23;en>>
Prior to his election as a judge of this honorable court, Mr. Baka didn't have any judicial experience in Hungary.

<<2106.23;2139.31;en>>
Due to the political nature of the selection and election as a judge of the court in 1991 and to the differences in the working methods of national trial courts and of an international court, respectively, the applicant's service at this court was not regarded by national courier judges as a judicial service of equal value, which is reflected by the fact that in May 2008, when the president of the republic first nominated Mr. Baka for president of the Supreme Court,

<<2139.31;2150.23;en>>
the National Council of Justice, a quasi-self-governing body of judicial administration, didn't find him professionally suitable for this position.

<<2150.23;2160.43;en>>
It was only after a one-year vacancy at the post of president of the Supreme Court when the president of the republic repeatedly nominated Mr. Baka

<<2160.43;2164.59;en>>
that he was elected in the third round of voting by the parliament.

<<2164.59;2180.47;en>>
By the time, in the context of the actual political situation in Hungary, the applicant's election became more of an issue of the authority of the president of the republic than of the professional suitability of the applicant.

<<2180.47;2225.63;en>>
It appears that two and a half years in his office couldn't make the Hungarian judiciary forget the circumstances of his election and the Hungarian Association of Judges, which is a civil society organization with a membership of about 1,600 judges, more than half of the number of the active judges in Hungary felt the need to propose stronger guarantees to be included in the new legislation in order to depoliticize the election process as much as possible and to limit the choice of politicians to a pre-existing pool of carrier judges subjected to strict rules of political independence.

<<2228.11;2242.47;en>>
At the time of the applicant's election as president of the Supreme Court, this function was combined with the functions of the president of the National Council of Justice, the head of administration of the judicial system.

<<2242.47;2277.87;en>>
Although now the applicant claims that it is not the first function which was accessorial to the letter, but the other way around, the government point out that at his first hearing on the 14th, May, 2008, at the Parliamentary Commission on Constitutional and Justice Affairs, before his election, he spoke at length about his ideas concerning the administration of the judicial system before making two short remarks about the tasks of the Supreme Court introduced by the following sentence.

<<2277.87;2291.75;en>>
Considering that I am a nominee to the post of president, not only of the National Council of Justice, but also of the Supreme Court, I would like to make only a few remarks as a candidate for the presidency of the Supreme Court.

<<2291.75;2305.25;en>>
The overwhelming majority of the questions put to him at the parliamentary hearing also related to his future tasks as president of the National Council of Justice.

<<2305.25;2317.07;en>>
The dominance of the letter functions in this hybrid post was also apparent in the actual work that was carried out by the applicant during his term of office.

<<2317.07;2321.43;en>>
In practice, Mr. Baca mostly performed representative tasks

<<2321.43;2326.83;en>>
as well as some managerial tasks as president of the National Council of Justice.

<<2326.83;2340.39;en>>
The statements on account of which his term of office was allegedly terminated were also made in his official capacity as president of the National Council of Justice.

<<2340.39;2344.03;en>>
It follows that since both Mr. Baca's election

<<2344.03;2363.73;en>>
and his activities were mostly connected with the functions of the president of the National Council of Justice, the president of the National Judicial Office is more appropriate to be regarded as his successor in his office than the president of the Courier after the termination of the applicant's hybrid office.

<<2363.73;2366.75;en>>
Mr. President, honorable members of the court,

<<2366.75;2376.09;en>>
having set out the factual context of the case, I shall now turn to the issue of applicability of Article VI of the convention.

<<2376.09;2390.35;en>>
First of all, the government are of the opinion that the Eskalinan test, or at least its first condition, is not applicable to cases where flat denial of access to court is alleged.

<<2390.35;2398.43;en>>
It is evident from the contradictory nature of both the applicant's arguments and the chamber's reasoning.

<<2398.43;2412.19;en>>
The applicant complained that he had not had access to a court or any other body performing a judicial function that could be qualified as a court for the purposes of the Eskalinan test.

<<2412.19;2427.87;en>>
He argued that the constitution-making majority of the legislator deliberately chose to enact a legislative act at the highest level of the hierarchy of laws in order to preclude his access to the constitutional court.

<<2427.87;2440.11;en>>
And yet, he claims that the first condition of the Eskalinan test was not met because his right of access to court was excluded by domestic law.

<<2440.11;2454.27;en>>
The chamber found that the act complained of by the applicant was not subject to any form of judicial review, 75 paragraph of the judgment.

<<2454.27;2460.11;en>>
Yet, it concluded that access to court was not excluded by law.

<<2460.11;2470.95;en>>
In order to eliminate this confusion, the government requests the honorable grand chamber to find that the fundamental law is part of domestic law.

<<2470.95;2479.39;en>>
And if access to court is excluded by the rules of constitutional law, then it is excluded by law.

<<2479.39;2490.87;en>>
Therefore, even if the condition of the Eskalinan test is applicable, it should be considered satisfied.

<<2490.87;2505.55;en>>
The essence of the Eskalinan test is that when domestic law itself allows access to a court to challenge decisions concerning public servants, the civil law nature of the dispute concerned must be presumed.

<<2505.55;2520.39;en>>
And the government cannot rely on the public law nature of these disputes in order to exclude the applicability of Article 6, paragraph 1 of the convention in the proceedings before the court.

<<2520.39;2529.03;en>>
When access to court is not guaranteed by domestic law, it is the Pellegrin test which is still applicable.

<<2529.03;2555.15;en>>
Disputes raised by public servants whose duties typify the specific activities of the public service insofar as the latter is acting as the depository of public authority responsible for protecting the general interests of the state or other public authorities fall outside the scope of Article 6, paragraph 1 of the convention.

<<2555.15;2571.15;en>>
The second condition of the Eskalinan test, namely that the exclusion from access to court must be justified on objective grounds in the state's interest, is essentially a reverting of the Pellegrin test.

<<2571.15;2604.07;en>>
The government are of the opinion that under any of the above tests, the dispute at issue in the present case, a claim for a perverted right to hold an office as president of the Supreme Court and the National Council of Justice, one of the highest ranking public offices of a state with special constitutional status, was clearly of a public law nature, falling outside the scope of applicability of Article 6 of the convention.

<<2604.07;2627.67;en>>
The government referred to the court's finding in the case of Harabin versus Slovakia in 2002 that the applicant's post as president of the Supreme Court has involved by its very nature the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the state.

<<2627.67;2644.47;en>>
Moreover, public prosecutors have been found by the court to fall in the category of public servants exercising discretionary powers intrinsic to state sovereignty in accordance with the second condition of the Eskalinan test.

<<2644.47;2677.25;en>>
It follows that the post of the president of the Supreme Court in Hungary, whose privileges were regulated among those of the highest ranking public officials, including the president of the republic or the prime minister, clearly fell into the category of public servants in respect of which the right of access to court under Article 6 is not applicable in disputes concerning the termination of their office.

<<2677.25;2696.19;en>>
As regards the special constitutional status of the president of the Supreme Court as compared to other judges and the administrative heads of lower courts, I emphasize that none of the other judges or court executives were elected by the parliament and enjoyed the same privileges as the applicant.

<<2696.19;2705.39;en>>
And none of the court executives, other than the president of the Supreme Court, were excluded from supervision by the National Council of Justice.

<<2705.39;2714.23;en>>
The only common provision regulating their legal status was that the tenure of office was six years.

<<2714.23;2730.41;en>>
Another aspect of the applicability of Article 6, which arises in light of the third party interventions, is whether Article 6 can be interpreted as conferring on judges an individual right to independence.

<<2730.41;2745.65;en>>
It is clear from the wording of Article 6 that the holders of rights under Article 6 are those who are parties to judicial proceedings and not the judges proceeding in their cases.

<<2745.65;2757.79;en>>
Contrary to the third parties, the government are of the opinion that no individual right of judges to independence can be derived from Article 6.

<<2757.79;2763.91;en>>
The arguments of the third parties, therefore, have no relevance to the present case.

<<2763.91;2771.59;en>>
Similarly, the judgment of the European Court of Justice relied upon by the applicant in the case of Mr. Iori,

<<2771.59;2778.61;en>>
former parliamentary commissioner for data protection, was delivered in a different legal context.

<<2778.61;2794.63;en>>
To picture this difference, I would cite the statements of Hungarian NGOs most active in the field of human rights protection made after the judgment to the effect that it was not Mr. Iori who had the right to an independent data protection

<<2794.63;2798.31;en>>
institution, but the citizens of Hungary.

<<2798.31;2812.51;en>>
Under Article 6, it is not the applicant who has the right to be an independent judge, but Hungarian citizens and everyone under Hungarian jurisdiction have the right to have an independent judiciary.

<<2812.51;2829.37;en>>
Therefore, the applicant cannot claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the convention in respect of any of the general concerns about the independence of the judiciary raised by the third parties and himself alike.

<<2829.37;2832.23;en>>
Mr. President, let me now highlight

<<2832.23;2838.47;en>>
some issues concerning the applicant's complaint under Article 10 of the convention.

<<2838.47;2853.55;en>>
Contrary to the applicant's allegations, there was no interference with his freedom of expression since the termination of his mandate as president of the Supreme Court had no relationship with the opinions expressed by him.

<<2853.55;2866.23;en>>
The fact that the public expression of his opinions predated the termination of his mandate is not sufficient to prove that there was a kosher relationship between them.

<<2866.23;2885.03;en>>
First, I point out that the constitutional court has found that the termination of the office of the vice president of the Supreme Court was objectively justified by the fundamental changes in the tasks and competencies of the president of the Korea.

<<2885.03;2893.71;en>>
It follows that the termination of the office of the president of the Supreme Court itself is justified for the same reasons.

<<2893.71;2913.51;en>>
Without elaborating on the details of these changes, which were set out in the government's memorial, I would simply point out that the constitutional court is in a better position than this honorable court to evaluate the nature of the changes in the Hungarian judicial system.

<<2913.51;2928.39;en>>
And the government see no reason for the court to overrule the finding of the constitutional court that there were indeed fundamental changes in the functions of the supreme judiciary authority in Hungary.

<<2928.39;2943.15;en>>
Moreover, in addition to the nature of the changes relevant to the termination of the office of vice president of the Supreme Court, there were further fundamental changes concerning the applicant's office itself.

<<2943.15;2960.39;en>>
When the hybrid function of president of the Supreme Court and the National Council of Justice, the applicant had been elected for ceased to exist upon the entry into force of the new fundamental law of Hungary, it was replaced by two offices.

<<2960.39;2967.03;en>>
The president of the Courier was the legal successor of the functions of the president of the Supreme Court.

<<2967.03;2976.63;en>>
And the president of the National Judicial Office was the legal successor to the functions of the president of the National Council of Justice.

<<2976.63;2994.37;en>>
Having regard to the circumstances of the applicant's election and his actual activities during his office, the president of the National Judicial Office is more appropriate to be regarded as his successor in his office than the president of the Courier.

<<2994.37;3006.39;en>>
Therefore, the changes stemming from the separation of the two posts themselves would have justified a reassessment of the applicant's suitability to either of the new functions.

<<3006.39;3024.51;en>>
However, it was felt that such a reassessment, which in light of the conditions of eligibility originally proposed, would have been necessarily of a political nature, just like the assessment prior to the applicant's election, was not appropriate.

<<3024.51;3030.51;en>>
That is why the political statements relied upon by the applicant have been made.

<<3030.51;3067.43;en>>
Later, however, at the very last stage of consultations with civil society organizations at a conference organized by the Hungarian Association of Judges on the 5th of November, 2011, at the Hungarian Academy for Training of Judges, which is a unit part of the Office of the National Council of Justice headed at the time by the applicant, the Association of 1,600 Professional Judges proposed that stricter professional criteria should be met by candidates to the posts of president of the National Judicial Office.

<<3067.43;3072.23;en>>
Members of the National Judicial Council and the president of the Korea.

<<3072.23;3091.55;en>>
Pursuant to that proposal, which was subsequently submitted by the Association to the competent parliamentary commission, a general eligibility criterion of five years of judicial service in Hungary was introduced for all the posts mentioned.

<<3091.55;3112.11;en>>
The government are of the opinion that the proposal of the Hungarian Association of Judges for the inclusion of the new eligibility criterion was motivated rather by circumstances of the applicant's election than by his statements made as president of the National Council of Justice.

<<3112.11;3129.59;en>>
Therefore, acceptance of this proposal by the legislator cannot be regarded as an interference with the applicant's freedom of expression, but as a means necessary to strengthen the authority and independence of the judiciary.

<<3129.59;3141.49;en>>
A five years of so-called waiting period is appropriate to ensure that no one could be appointed as a judge only in order to be nominated as president of the Korea.

<<3141.49;3155.55;en>>
It limits the scope of political bargaining in the process of election of the president of the Korea, whose role is more judicial and less managerial than that of the president of the Supreme Court used to be.

<<3155.55;3167.39;en>>
It limits the choice of politicians to a pre-existing pool of career judges subjected to strict rules of political independence under Hungarian law.

<<3167.39;3177.15;en>>
The applicant's service as a judge of an international court didn't justify these requirements as evidenced by the circumstances of his election.

<<3177.15;3192.69;en>>
Irrespective of the rules of independence applying to judges serving at international tribunals, the perception of their political independence always remains tainted by the political elements in their selection.

<<3192.69;3222.43;en>>
In this context, I would draw your attention to the fact that in spite of the improvements introduced in 2008 by the establishment of the so-called Wildhaber Committee, there is still an ongoing discussion within the Council of Europe about how the independence of the judges of the court could be better ensured, including by the rules of their selection and election at national and international level, respectively.

<<3222.43;3242.43;en>>
There have also been concerns expressed that national judges whose presence on this court is deemed to be highly desirable might be discouraged in many member states under the present rules of selection and election from becoming a candidate to be a judge of this court.

<<3242.43;3258.07;en>>
This proves the government's point that judicial service at an international court cannot be equated with national judicial service from the point of view of the independence or the perceived independence of the judiciary.

<<3258.07;3281.39;en>>
The aforesaid clearly show that the termination of the applicant's term of office as president of the Supreme Court was justified by the organizational and functional changes in the system of court administration and in the competencies of the Courier, and the new eligibility criteria was justified by the need to enhance the independence of the judiciary.

<<3281.39;3293.19;en>>
The measure complained of by the applicant had no connection with his opinion expressed in the media, and therefore there was no interference with his freedom of expression.

<<3293.19;3319.55;en>>
In the alternative, should the court find that the applicant was removed from his office as president of the Supreme Court on account of the opinions expressed by him, the government are of the opinion that the measure complained of was necessary in a democratic society for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary within the meaning of paragraph two of article 10.

<<3319.55;3344.75;en>>
Having regard to the circumstances of the applicant's election as president of the Supreme Court as well as to the fact that his actual functions and activities were rather of an administrative than of a judicial nature, the government submit that the applicant's office was very much of a governmental nature, too much so for the requirements of the independence of the judiciary.

<<3344.75;3358.55;en>>
Therefore, his removal from that office should be assessed in the light of the rules governing removal of the political appointees or government functionaries rather than the removal of judges.

<<3358.55;3384.55;en>>
Accordingly, the applicant who was elected in a process similar to the election to other high political functions is reasonable to be regarded as a political actor whose expressions, even concerning professional issues, are political expressions and whose removal from office, like his election to that office, is subject to political considerations.

<<3384.55;3398.47;en>>
In this case, the relevant political considerations were justified in a democratic society with a view to increasing the independence of the judiciary and thus for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

<<3398.47;3410.79;en>>
The measure was proportional since the applicant was not removed from his office as a judge and was accorded beneficial treatment in order to serve as Supreme Court judge.

<<3410.79;3422.39;en>>
Therefore, his removal from a governmental administrative position cannot be considered to have had any chilling effect on the expression of professional opinions by other judges.

<<3422.39;3441.35;en>>
It is to be underlined that any of the applicant's expression was not made as a judge or in a judicial function, but as a political appointee performing primarily managerial and administrative tasks to operate the judicial system and exercising in regard public power.

<<3441.35;3465.91;en>>
Moreover, the government considers that when it comes to the selection of the most suitable candidate for a position of head of a given organization with redefined functions and competence, the views of the candidate concerning the newly reformed organization are legitimately taken into account by any employer.

<<3465.91;3496.47;en>>
As regards the lack of judicial decision, the government submits that no adverse conclusions should be drawn from it in the context of proportionality because the inclusion of a requirement of a judicial remedy into Article 10 of the Convention would be contrary to Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Convention, which do not require that the right of access to court be guaranteed in respect of disputes of a public law nature.

<<3496.47;3514.43;en>>
Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the law itself set higher standards of eligibility for the president of the highest court in Hungary as regards professional qualifications and independence, which the applicant didn't meet.

<<3514.43;3544.35;en>>
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and the doctrine of the margin of appreciation of the state, the government are of the opinion that it is for the national legislator to decide what eligibility criteria they find appropriate for the highest-ranking judicial post in Hungary, and no provision of the Convention can be interpreted to require that the legislator's decision be subjected to judicial review.

<<3544.35;3552.75;en>>
Finally, I would like to react to some allegations of the applicant which were made in the context of Article 41.

<<3552.75;3576.59;en>>
Contrary to the applicant's arguments, there were objective reasons of principle for the revocation of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 2000, governing the remuneration and allowances of the president of the republic, the prime minister, the president of the parliament, the president of the constitutional court, and the president of the supreme court.

<<3576.59;3588.79;en>>
The act, as it was introduced in 2000, provided for the president of the republic a pension supplement for life after his retirement from office, a so-called presidential pension.

<<3588.79;3600.39;en>>
In 2008, an amendment of the law was proposed by an opposition MP to the effect that the same allowance be provided for retired prime ministers.

<<3600.39;3614.75;en>>
The proposal was accepted, but as an unintended result of some cross-references in the act, all other former high public officials under the effect of the act became entitled to the benefit.

<<3614.75;3624.51;en>>
The revocation of the act served to eliminate this unintended result, pro futuro, and to return to the original state of affairs.

<<3624.51;3631.03;en>>
Under the law in force, presidential pension is only due to former presidents of the republic.

<<3631.03;3636.79;en>>
As a matter of course, acquired rights were not affected by the revocation of the act.

<<3636.79;3646.23;en>>
Those whose term of office had expired before the revocation of the act remained entitled to the post-term benefits.

<<3646.23;3656.11;en>>
However, the applicant had no acquired right to the post-term benefits provided for by that act.

<<3656.11;3663.25;en>>
Post-term benefits were provided for ex-presidents and ex-prime ministers while it was in force.

<<3663.25;3669.51;en>>
The right to these benefits was acquired by termination of the office and not while in office.

<<3669.51;3677.51;en>>
Furthermore, in respect of the presidential pension, the reaching of a pensionable age was a cumulative condition.

<<3677.51;3687.97;en>>
When the applicant's mandate was terminated and said act was no longer in force, therefore he didn't have a legitimate expectation to receive those benefits.

<<3687.97;3694.15;en>>
Contrary to the applicant's allegations, such benefits are not provided for the new president of the Courier-Aider.

<<3694.15;3706.87;en>>
Taking into consideration the efforts that I respectfully request the Honorable Court to find that insofar as the provision invoked are applicable, there was no violation of Mr. Bakos' right

<<3706.87;3709.11;en>>
under the convention.

<<3709.11;3712.51;en>>
Mr. President, that concludes what

<<3712.51;3714.35;en>>
I wish to say at this stage.

<<3714.35;3716.97;en>>
May I thank you, Mr. President and members of the court,

<<3716.97;3720.79;en>>
for listening to me so patiently and attentively.

<<3720.79;3722.43;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Luis López Guerra]]

<<3723.4;3725.04;en>>
Thank you for your interventions.

<<3725.04;3735.34;en>>
And now I would like to invite the judges of the Grand Chamber to put any question they may have to the parties, judge Yudkivska.

[[Judge;Ganna Yudkivska]]

<<3740.15;3741.67;en>>
Thank you, President.

<<3741.67;3749.15;en>>
I have two questions to the government, but of course, if the applicant wish to comment, he can do so.

<<3749.15;3754.39;en>>
My first question relates to applicability of Article 6.

<<3754.39;3765.67;en>>
It appears that claiming that the first condition of the Escalinan test, namely the explicit exclusion of access to court, has been met.

<<3765.67;3784.91;en>>
Your government relied heavily on the fact that the applicant's dismissal had been written into the fundamental law itself, namely transitional provisions of the fundamental law, and was therefore not subject to any form of judicial review.

<<3784.91;3800.63;en>>
I would like to refer, however, to the decision of your constitutional court, number 45, 2012, of 28 December 2012, in which the constitutional court concluded as follows.

<<3800.63;3830.23;en>>
I quote, the constitutional court possesses, beyond doubt, the competence to proceed with reviewing transitional provisions of the fundamental law in whole and in parts on formal grounds with regard to its validity, invalidity, under public law, irrespectively to the fact whether transitional provisions of the fundamental law is or is not part of the fundamental law.

<<3830.23;3837.63;en>>
I would like to ask you to clarify your position in light of this decision by the constitutional court.

<<3837.63;3846.79;en>>
And my second question relates to the undertaking by your government to the Venice Commission in July 2011.

<<3846.79;3862.99;en>>
Again, I quote, Hungary assures the commission that the drafting of transitional provisions will not be used to unduly put an end to the terms of office of persons elected under the previous legal regime.

<<3862.99;3869.65;en>>
I wonder if this undertaking's set times included the applicant or not.

<<3869.65;3870.15;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Luis López Guerra]]

<<3871.99;3872.99;en>>
Thank you, judge Pinto de Albuquerque.

[[Judge;Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque]]

<<3875.68;3876.8;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<3877.7;3884.32;en>>
My two questions addressed to the government, but of course, the applicant can also comment on them.

<<3884.76;3890.78;en>>
The first one is on a point of Hungarian constitutional law.

<<3891.82;3907.28;en>>
Professor and judge Otto Bachof in 1951 wrote a marvelous text on a for fast ones, "Verfassungswidrige Verfassungsnormen", meaning unconstitutional constitutional norms.

<<3908.59;3910.28;en>>
My point is the following.

<<3910.87;3915.37;en>>
Uh, what is the situation with regard to Hungarian constitutional law?

<<3915.68;3931.34;en>>
Uh, does, uh, the constitutional law and the constitutional doctrine, um, uh, in Hungary acknowledge the possibility that there might be norms in the constitution that are unconstitutional.

<<3932.12;3944.34;en>>
For instance, imagine that a reform of the constitution provides for a suspension of in a mobility of a part of the judiciary.

<<3946.61;3959.57;en>>
Would that, uh, law enshrined, uh, through the means of a transitional provision, for instance, in the constitution be valid?

<<3963.93;3975.01;en>>
My second question, uh, is related to, uh, section 114 of the organization and administration of the courts act.

<<3976.57;3988.76;en>>
These provision established a new criterion for the election of the new president, which led to the eligibility of the former president of the Supreme court as president of the courier.

<<3989.34;4000.32;en>>
This criterion referred to the time served as a judge in Hungary, not counting the time served as a judge in the European court, for instance.

<<4001.93;4002.45;en>>
Now, Mr.

<<4002.45;4012.24;en>>
Baka, the applicant served these courts 17 years from 1991 to 2008.

<<4012.24;4025.01;en>>
We are today that the position of the garment is that a career of 17 years in this court, in the European court of human rights as the one of Mr.

<<4025.01;4056.61;en>>
Baka is not of equal value as the career for the same period of time in the domestic courts, I would like to hear the reasons I would like that the government clarified the reasons why this career of 17 years here at the court is not of the same value of a career at the national courts.

<<4056.61;4074.09;en>>
I'm not sure if I understood correctly the point of the government when it referred to the discussion, the ongoing discussion in the, um, council of Europe on the independence of the judges of the European court.

<<4074.09;4089.2;en>>
I'm not sure if I understood correctly that the government of Hungary doubts about the independence of these judges, of the judges of this court, that the judges of this court are not politically independent.

<<4089.2;4098.81;en>>
And that was the reason why the career of 17 years of Mr.

<<4098.81;4106.31;en>>
Baca was not of equal value of a career of a judge in the domestic courts for the same period.

<<4106.31;4133.06;en>>
I would like the government to clarify if that is the position, um, that was presented because I did not really understand the point of the government when it referred to the ongoing discussion in the council of Europe about the independence and the reinforcement of the independence of the judges of the European court.

<<4133.06;4133.06;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Luis López Guerra]]

<<4134.6;4135.4;en>>
Thank you.

<<4135.4;4135.9;en>>
Judge Lemmens.

[[Judge;Paul Lemmens]]

<<4139.24;4142.28;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<4142.28;4145.2;en>>
I would like to ask a question to both parties.

<<4145.2;4158.52;en>>
And the question is somewhat prompted by something that was mentioned by counsel for the applicant about the possibility for judges to bring claims before the service tribunal.

<<4158.52;4170.24;en>>
I would like to ask what would be the situation in, legal situation in two somewhat different situations than the one that we are discussing today.

<<4170.24;4181.52;en>>
One is, the first one is the situation where a judge, an individual judge would be considered to be no longer suitable for the job.

<<4181.52;4185.64;en>>
What sort of a suitability could be mentioned?

<<4185.64;4192.12;en>>
Illness, would this also include political insuitability?

<<4192.12;4196.44;en>>
Would that be a reason to take action against a judge?

<<4196.44;4202.0;en>>
And my question here would be in particular, what would be the competent body to take action?

<<4202.0;4206.52;en>>
And would there be any possibility of judicial review?

<<4206.52;4223.0;en>>
And the second situation is the one of an alleged, in inappropriate conduct of a judge, a conduct of a judge that is incompatible with judicial ethics.

<<4223.0;4228.72;en>>
Would it be possible to bring disciplinary proceedings against the judge?

<<4228.72;4231.28;en>>
And if so, what would then be the competent body?

<<4231.28;4234.64;en>>
And would there be a possibility of judicial review?

<<4234.64;4244.4;en>>
I repeat, I realize that these are not the situations in this case, but to get a broader picture, I would like to know what would happen in these two situations.

<<4244.4;4244.4;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Luis López Guerra]]

<<4248.15;4265.17;en>>
Then the call will now rise for 25 minutes, and following which the parties will return for a second round of short briefings to respond to the submissions in the first round and to the judges' questions.

<<4265.17;4266.33;en>>
So that's 25 minutes.

[[Announcer;UNK]]

<<4345.71;4346.29;fr>>
La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Luis López Guerra]]

<<4395.59;4399.63;en>>
The hearing is now resumed and I call Mr. Cech to the floor.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<4403.18;4411.18;en>>
Mr. President, I first address the question of Mr. Judge Albuquerque.

<<4411.18;4421.2;en>>
In Hungary, there is no institutional solution for the problem of unconstitutional provisions of the Constitution or of its modification.

<<4421.2;4433.45;en>>
The Constitutional Court held that it cannot revise the merits of constitutional provision, only the legislation process may be subject of revision.

<<4433.45;4454.94;en>>
However, it does not preclude the legislator to readapt in the course of a due process to include substantially unconstitutional provisions into the Constitution.

<<4454.94;4464.18;en>>
I turn to the question of Mr. Judge Lemons.

<<4464.18;4481.18;en>>
The former Act on the Judiciary included that if an appraisal of the court executive's management activity established his or her incompetence, the court executive was to be dismissed.

<<4481.18;4489.72;en>>
This decision was subject to revision by the service tribunal.

<<4489.72;4506.41;en>>
A judge must be politically independent, of course, so if this requirement is not fulfilled, it may lead to a disciplinary procedure which may be revised by the service tribunal.

<<4506.41;4519.26;en>>
Although the government tried to suggest that the applicants' expressions were of political nature, since they regard the applicants as a political appointee, it is far from being correct.

<<4519.26;4531.32;en>>
The truth is, in contrast, that all opinions the applicants made public were formulated from a strictly professional approach by the representatives of the judiciary.

<<4531.32;4537.98;en>>
In order to prove that, we provided dozens of evidence.

<<4537.98;4549.16;en>>
This led the Chamber to the conclusion.

<<4549.16;4552.7;en>>
We cannot escape from asking the questions.

<<4552.7;4561.98;en>>
Once the present ruling parties deemed the applicant unsuitable, why did they vote for his election to Strasbourg Court?

<<4561.98;4566.38;en>>
Why did they vote for his election to be President of the Supreme Court?

<<4566.38;4574.11;en>>
And why did they broaden his competences as President of the National Council of Justice?

<<4574.11;4581.9;en>>
And let me take a few observations to the submission of the government.

<<4581.9;4589.66;en>>
First, as to the role of the Association of Hungarian Judges, two remarks.

<<4589.66;4606.16;en>>
The government should have fulfilled its statutory obligation to consult on matters affecting the judiciary with the National Council of Justice, the only official representative body of the judiciary at the material time.

<<4606.16;4610.03;en>>
But they failed to do so.

<<4610.03;4618.57;en>>
Nevertheless, the independence of a civil association which concludes a cooperation agreement with the government is at least questionable.

<<4618.57;4634.24;en>>
As to the five-year criterion, first and foremost, a newly introduced eligibility criterion without being retractive cannot serve as a legal ground for dismissing someone elected before.

<<4634.24;4644.78;en>>
Therefore it is obvious that the only reason of adopting this new criterion was to preclude even the theoretical possibility of the applicant's re-election.

<<4644.78;4660.68;en>>
In addition, in our view, this is not adequate precondition for electing a person having due managerial and leadership skills, nor does it secure the existence of thorough professional existence.

<<4660.68;4672.3;en>>
And finally, a brief remark to the Eskalinan test, the applicability of Article 6.

<<4672.3;4680.64;en>>
The right of access to court is a key issue, the existence of which cannot depend on speculation.

<<4680.64;4685.41;en>>
That is the reason why this court set up the Eskalinan test.

<<4685.41;4697.45;en>>
On the ground of the first requirement of this test, it may be clearly established without any speculation whether someone has the right to court or it is excluded.

<<4697.45;4709.7;en>>
Therefore, the mere fact that someone's duties involve the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive regarding the applicability of Article 6.

<<4709.7;4727.26;en>>
Furthermore, in the fundamental law, but even in the former Constitution, there has been – there hasn't been any clear exclusion of the right of access to court in respect of the President of the Supreme Court.

<<4727.26;4728.26;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court, thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Luis López Guerra]]

<<4732.03;4735.39;en>>
Thank you Mr. Cech, I call now Mr. Tallódi.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<4740.05;4743.85;en>>
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. President,

<<4743.85;4745.53;en>>
honorable members.

<<4745.53;4760.41;en>>
Firstly, I would like to follow the line of my distinguished colleague, answering the questions concerning the constitutionality of the transitional rules.

<<4760.41;4769.71;en>>
The constitutional court is bound by the fundamental law, and it cannot overrule its provisions.

<<4769.71;4786.53;en>>
The constitutional court could only establish that certain provisions of the transitional provisions were, in fact, not of a transitional nature, and that was the reason for finding them unconstitutional.

<<4786.53;4797.27;en>>
These provisions which were found unconstitutional didn't include the provision relating to the applicant's removal.

<<4797.27;4820.13;en>>
The government submits in this respect that should there have been any doubts as to the competence of the constitutional court to review the constitutionality of the said provision, the applicant wouldn't have argued that he had not had access to a court, including the constitutional court.

<<4820.13;4841.75;en>>
Should the court find that the constitutional court was competent to review the said provision, the government submits that the applicant failed to have to take this remedy, with the meaning of Article 25, paragraph 1.

<<4841.75;4860.27;en>>
The reason for the government not reacting to the four issues presented in the first 10 minutes of the oral submissions of the applicant's representative is not that their presentation was entirely correct, but that they are irrelevant to the present case.

<<4860.27;4873.95;en>>
The applicant was the sole president of the Supreme Court, therefore general legislation on the status of the president of the Supreme Court necessarily affected only the applicant.

<<4873.95;4891.23;en>>
Structural changes as justification for the applicant's removal from office were first identified indirectly by the constitutional court, not by the government and not by the state.

<<4891.23;4905.51;en>>
The fundamental nature of the changes of the functions, especially the new power to review local government legislation, must be viewed not as a quantitative, but a qualitative change.

<<4905.51;4908.69;en>>
This is also very important.

<<4908.69;4925.77;en>>
And I would like to pay the attention to the fact that there were political forces at play at the first time of the election of the applicant as president of the Supreme Court.

<<4925.77;4940.29;en>>
Concerning the further questions, the applicant's removal didn't concern the acknowledgement of the applicant's professional achievements by the government.

<<4940.29;4950.83;en>>
It was the result of proposals by the judiciary which deemed it necessary in order to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.

<<4950.83;4965.95;en>>
It was very important that a summary of the contributions and speeches made at the conference of the 5th of November 2011 was published at the website of the Hungarian Association of Judges.

<<4965.95;4983.47;en>>
And the association also welcomed on its website the proposal of amendment to relevant bills submitted by the Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Affairs upon the association's initiative, amounting to more than 40 pages altogether.

<<4983.47;4994.97;en>>
It appears, however, that at first the parliamentary committee didn't accept the association's proposal for the new eligibility criterion.

<<4994.97;5011.03;en>>
On the 7th of November 2011, the association renewed its request to enact a new eligibility criterion of eight years of judicial service in respect of both the president of the National Judicial Office and the president of the Courier.

<<5011.03;5027.01;en>>
It was upon the association's insistence that the parliamentary committee submitted a new proposal for amendment of the bill with a five-year service requirement, and the five years correspond to the tenure of the office of the president of the republic.

<<5027.01;5034.15;en>>
In order to prevent any wrong conclusions, I have to note that both Ms. Honda and Mr. Darak would

<<5034.15;5038.99;en>>
have satisfied with this eight-year requirement.

<<5038.99;5044.99;en>>
And a short comment to the Eskalinan test, yes?

<<5044.99;5047.99;en>>
Eskalinan test.

<<5047.99;5069.05;en>>
The government reiterates that the Eskalinan test cannot be applied to the present case since it was established in a case which concerned, unlike the present one, not the right of access to a court, but the applicability of other procedural guarantees provided by Article 6, Paragraph 1.

<<5069.05;5095.61;en>>
The effect of the Eskalinan test is that when domestic law itself allows access to a court to challenge decisions concerning public servants, the civil law nature of the dispute concern must be presumed, and the government cannot rely on the public law nature of these disputes in order to exclude the applicability of Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the convention.

<<5095.61;5119.93;en>>
Finally, I would like to pay your kind attention that the disciplinary measures fall under the jurisdiction of service tribunals, which are under Article 6 of the convention.

<<5119.93;5153.63;en>>
No issue of political situation can arise in respect of ordinary judges, so we have to divide the ordinary or general judges and the president of the court, and no other judges are elected by a kind of political process, so we have to divide again the method of the selection of the so-called normal judges and the president of the court.

<<5153.63;5157.23;en>>
Thank you very much for your kindness.

<<5157.23;5163.07;en>>
Yes, only one important last comment.

<<5163.07;5181.19;en>>
The judges, what I mentioned before, these concerns don't apply to the judges who served as national judges before their election to this court.

<<5181.19;5184.45;en>>
Had Mr. Boka been a national judge before his

<<5184.45;5194.03;en>>
election to this court, his service at the international court would have been recognized as equal service.

<<5194.03;5194.03;en>>
Thank you very much for your kind attention.

[[JudgeP;Luis López Guerra]]

<<5198.2;5199.32;en>>
No other questions?

<<5200.84;5201.32;en>>
Okay.

<<5203.16;5205.56;en>>
We have now come to the end of the hearing.

<<5206.36;5210.76;en>>
I thank the parties for their interventions and answer to the court's questions.

<<5211.56;5214.05;en>>
The court will now deliberate on the merits.

<<5214.05;5219.8;en>>
The judgment will be delivered later, and the parties will be informed of the date of delivery.

<<5219.8;5219.8;en>>
I declare this hearing closed.

La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<16.32;29.18;en>>
Good morning to all participants in this public hearing organized by the European Court of Human Rights with the use of video conferencing technology which has been made necessary due to the COVID-19 health crisis.

<<29.18;42.06;en>>
I wish to begin by thanking the applicant and the responding government for their cooperation in preparing this hearing under merits in the case of Abdi Ibrahim versus Norway which I now declare open.

<<42.06;51.78;en>>
I should note before proceeding that this hearing is being recorded in its entirety and will be webcast in order to ensure its public character.

<<51.78;58.86;en>>
It will be available to the public on the court's website from 2.30 this afternoon.

<<58.86;70.74;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on 17 March 2016 under Article 34 of the Convention by Somali National, Maria Abdi Ibrahim.

<<70.74;78.88;en>>
The application was allocated to the second section of the court pursuant to Rule 52, Paragraph 1 of the Rules of Court.

<<78.88;85.8;en>>
The application was communicated to the government on 20 September 2016.

<<85.8;93.02;en>>
On 17 December 2019, a chamber of the second section delivered its judgment in the case.

<<93.02;113.82;en>>
It declared the application admissible and held that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention with regard to the proceedings in which the applicant had been deprived of her parental responsibilities in respect of her child and authorisation had been given to the child's foster parents to adopt him.

<<113.82;130.74;en>>
On 17 March 2020, the applicant requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention and the panel of the Grand Chamber accepted the request on 11 May 2020.

<<130.74;151.58;en>>
The President of the Grand Chamber granted leave to the governments of Denmark and Turkey and to the Air Centre and the adoptive parents of the applicant's child to submit written comments as third parties by virtue of Article 36, Paragraph 2 of the Convention and Rule 44, Paragraph 3 of the Rules of Court.

<<151.58;162.14;en>>
The governments of the Czech Republic were informed that the leave granted to them to intervene in the proceedings before the Chamber continued before the Grand Chamber.

<<162.14;192.78;en>>
The responding governments are represented by their agent, Mr Marius Emberland of the Office of the Attorney General, assisted by the co-agent, Ms Henriette Lund  Busch of the same office, they are also assisted by Ms Toini Oulie-Hauge, Ms Liv Inger Gjone Gabrielsen, Mr Erik Bolstad Pettersen, Ms Hilde Bautz-Holter Geving  and Mr Christina Kullmann Five, advisors.

<<192.78;204.58;en>>
The applicant is represented by Ms Anna Lutina, counsel, she is assisted by Mr Preben Henriksen, Mr Mads Andenæs and Mr Eirik Bjørge, advisors.

<<204.58;207.64;en>>
The applicant is also present.

<<207.64;211.58;en>>
I welcome the representatives in the name of the Court.

<<211.58;219.5;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and a representative of the applicant, I have determined the order to address as follows.

<<219.5;225.92;en>>
Ms Lutina for the applicant will speak first and then Mr Emberland for the government.

<<225.92;229.3;en>>
I now call on Ms Lutina, you have the floor please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<242.45;247.25;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the court.

<<247.25;250.41;en>>
My presentation is structured as follows.

<<250.41;256.45;en>>
I shall begin by setting out the most important elements in the factual background.

<<256.45;260.37;en>>
Then I present three legal submissions.

<<260.37;269.41;en>>
First, I turn to whether the Grand Chamber should revise the Chamber judgment's determination as to violation of Article 8.

<<269.41;277.13;en>>
Second, I come to whether there has been a violation of Article 9 and or Article 2 of Protocol Number 1.

<<277.13;281.37;en>>
Third, I turn to binding force and execution of the court's judgment.

<<286.37;300.17;en>>
This case originates in an application lodged by the applicant against Norway on 17 March 2016 for violations of Article 8 and Article 9 of the Convention.

<<300.17;306.13;en>>
When the applicant came to Norway from Somalia, she was only 17 years old.

<<306.13;311.17;en>>
She was seeking asylum for herself and her two-month-old son.

<<311.17;323.77;en>>
In Somalia, the applicant had become pregnant outside of marriage, age 16, and was therefore threatened by the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab.

<<323.77;331.13;en>>
July 2010, the Norwegian authorities granted the applicant and her son a temporary residence permit in Norway.

<<334.01;341.21;en>>
In Norway, the applicant and her son were in September 2010 placed in a parent-child institution.

<<341.21;344.73;en>>
That was mainly for observation purposes.

<<344.73;352.45;en>>
Less than a week later, the institution sent a notification of concern to the child welfare services.

<<352.45;359.21;en>>
The boy, then 10 months old, was subsequently placed in emergency foster care.

<<359.21;366.01;en>>
The child welfare services immediately proceeded to apply for the child to be placed in their care.

<<366.01;377.69;en>>
On December 10, 2010, by decision of the county social welfare board, the boy was placed in the care of the child welfare services.

<<377.69;383.05;en>>
The applicant was granted contact rights of two hours, four times a year.

<<383.05;395.85;en>>
On 13th of December, 2010, immediately after the board's decision, the child was moved to the foster parents, who would subsequently become his adoptive parents.

<<395.85;407.17;en>>
In its judgment of 6th of September, 2011, the district court upheld the board's decision, but extended the visitation rights to one hour, six times per year.

<<407.17;417.09;en>>
District court also expressed that it could not conclude that the placement of the child would last until he was an adult.

<<417.09;419.77;en>>
The applicant is a practicing Muslim.

<<419.77;425.77;en>>
Nevertheless, her child was placed with a practicing Christian family.

<<425.77;436.97;en>>
There, he would follow the daily life of the foster family and become an integral part of their Christian lifestyle, including eating pork and going to church with them.

<<436.97;443.49;en>>
Shortly after the child was placed with the foster parents, they stopped using his Muslim full name.

<<446.53;451.29;en>>
The family belongs to a local chapter of the Mission Covent Church of Norway.

<<451.29;457.93;en>>
As its name suggests, the foundational idea of the Mission Covent Church of Norway is evangelizing.

<<457.93;462.37;en>>
Its members' main task is to re-celetize.

<<462.37;475.29;en>>
Also, this church does not believe in infant baptism, but practices instead something called believers' baptism, where the person being baptized has actively accepted Jesus.

<<475.29;485.29;en>>
The main part of the social network of the family and their familial network was within the Mission Covent Church.

<<485.29;489.13;en>>
The foster mother also played a central role in the church.

<<489.13;492.33;en>>
She led the worship services.

<<492.33;502.41;en>>
During his placement, the applicant's son was actively subjected to and made to become part of the foster family's religious practice.

<<502.41;510.69;en>>
On the other hand, the applicant's own wishes for her son's religious upbringing were dismissed by the child welfare services.

<<510.69;526.21;en>>
Furthermore, on 11 September 2013, the child welfare services applied to the county social welfare board for an order to withdraw the applicant's parental responsibilities for the child and to consent to the foster parents adopting him.

<<526.21;531.81;en>>
On 21 March 2014, the board granted the child welfare services request.

<<531.81;534.13;en>>
The applicant appealed this decision.

<<534.13;539.33;en>>
On 21 November 2014, the district court upheld the board's decision.

<<539.33;552.05;en>>
The applicant appealed further to the high court, Lagmansretten in Norwegian, where on 27 May 2015, the majority of the court by 4 to 1 upheld this decision.

<<552.05;558.33;en>>
On 23 September 2015, the Supreme Court's appeal leave committee refused the applicant leave to appeal.

<<561.09;571.41;en>>
Following the adoption, the foster parents baptized the child in the Christian tradition of their church and gave him a new first name to reflect his new religious identity.

<<571.41;579.81;en>>
The foster family's intentions in this regard were well known to the domestic authorities when they reviewed the case.

<<579.81;584.61;en>>
I come then to the first of my three legal points.

<<584.61;592.01;en>>
Should the grand chamber revise the chamber judgment's determination as to violation of Article 8?

<<592.01;600.17;en>>
There are three reasons why the grand chamber should not revise the chamber judgment's determination as to Article 8.

<<600.17;608.21;en>>
First, the applicant requested that the case should be referred to the grand chamber only as regards the religious aspect and the remedies.

<<608.21;618.09;en>>
The Article 8 determination of the chamber was not among the reasons why the applicant requested that the case be referred to the grand chamber.

<<618.09;628.33;en>>
Second, the Norwegian government explicitly and clearly accepted the chamber's judgment of 17 December 2019 as binding.

<<628.33;633.77;en>>
Norway notified the court and the applicant of the position it had taken.

<<633.77;640.17;en>>
See, the email correspondence from the agent to the applicant enclosed in Appendix 16.

<<640.17;648.01;en>>
The applicant put faith and confidence in the government's stated position when the applicant made its request under Rule 73.

<<648.01;659.81;en>>
As the court has said in numerous cases, the government, and I quote, cannot put the court's arguments which are consistent with the position it previously adopted.

<<659.81;668.33;en>>
See, Pine Valley Development, LPD, and others versus Ireland, paragraph 47, and also Colompar versus Belgium, paragraph 32.

<<671.69;680.61;en>>
Grand chamber should not allow the government to reopen a question that was not among the grounds relied on by the applicant in her request for a referral.

<<680.61;692.09;en>>
And the government is, in any event, is stopped from now arguing that there is no breach of Article 8, a breach it previously accepted vis-a-vis both the court and the applicant.

<<692.09;704.81;en>>
But third, the government's substantive contentions as regards Article 8 are, in any event, wrong and should not lead to the grand chamber to revise the chamber's findings as regards Article 8.

<<704.81;713.49;en>>
The government's agent has argued in his written submissions that the chamber, in its judgment, erred in the application of the principles expressed in Strandlobben.

<<713.49;722.01;en>>
See the submissions in paragraph 111 to 117.

<<722.01;730.49;en>>
First, the agent argues that the chamber did not sufficiently adhere to the doctrine expressed in paragraph 213 of Strandlobben.

<<730.49;745.65;en>>
Secondly, the agent argues that the chamber did not refer to the facts that supported the position that there were compelling reasons and that deprivation of parental responsibility and consent to adoption clearly were the best interest of the child.

<<745.65;759.05;en>>
Thirdly, the agent argues that the chamber appears to have omitted in its judgment the very detailed assessment given by the high court, where the interests of the applicant and her situation are carefully balanced against the interests of the child.

<<762.69;768.93;en>>
These contentions, which criticize the judgment the government previously has accepted as binding, are all wrong.

<<768.93;773.97;en>>
The chamber's unanimous judgment follows the principles expressed in Strandlobben.

<<773.97;778.53;en>>
It is balanced and thorough in its reasoning.

<<778.53;796.37;en>>
However, when the applicant's rule 73 request as regards Article 9 was referred to the Grand Chamber, the Norwegian government saw it as an opportunity to cause the Grand Chamber to overturn two recent judgments where the chamber had found a violation of Article 8.

<<796.37;812.21;en>>
These judgments are Hernehult versus Norway and Pedersen and Others versus Norway, which were both delivered 10 March 2020, just two months before this case was referred to the Grand Chamber.

<<812.21;824.29;en>>
The Norwegian argument in the rule 73 requests relating to those two judgments was that the court had departed from the Strandlobben principles.

<<824.29;830.85;en>>
The Norwegian government's appeal was refused, but the Grand Chamber panel on 7 September 2020.

<<830.85;837.37;en>>
However, the government is raising the same argument here again.

<<837.37;852.37;en>>
This court's chamber judgment and the Norwegian Supreme Court have in the judgment and dialogue incrementally clarified Article 8 questions set out in Strandlobben and in the chamber judgment in the present case.

<<852.37;859.29;en>>
Article 8 submissions by the Norwegian government lawyers have been rejected at all the different stages before us.

<<859.29;872.49;en>>
In this connection, the applicant has noted the recent remarks the government's agent reported in two articles of the Norwegian press, see Appendix 18 and 19.

<<872.49;887.41;en>>
We will not say anything about those statements which speak for themselves, other that, regrettably, they represent the approach of the Office of the Attorney General to the judgments of the court.

<<887.41;904.85;en>>
A crucial point that was made in Strandlobben is that there need to be very exceptional circumstances to conclude that it is in the child's best interest to be adopted and thus sever the family ties, see paragraphs 207 to 209.

<<904.85;913.65;en>>
The mere fact that the child lives in foster care because the parents cannot provide adequate care for the child will not constitute such very exceptional circumstances.

<<913.65;922.61;en>>
The applicant's situation did not constitute such very exceptional circumstances that might allow adoption against the applicant's will.

<<922.61;925.69;en>>
I now come to my second point.

<<925.69;933.53;en>>
Has there been a violation of Article 9 and or Article 2 of Protocol Number 1?

<<933.53;941.93;en>>
According to Article 9.1, everyone has the right to exercise the freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.

<<941.93;948.73;en>>
Furthermore, Article 9 guarantees the right not only to hold a religious belief, but to manifest it.

<<948.73;958.21;en>>
Worship, teaching, practice, and observance are all mentioned specifically in Article 9 as forms of manifestation.

<<958.21;967.37;en>>
Only in extreme circumstances can the state interfere with this right to manifest one religion or belief.

<<967.37;976.05;en>>
The term practice, as employed in Article 9.1, does not cover each act which is motivated or influenced by religion or belief.

<<976.05;986.01;en>>
But for any parent, to raise a child in accordance with their own religion or belief is a direct manifestation of their religion or belief.

<<986.01;990.29;en>>
This practice is at the core of the perception of what religious freedom is.

<<993.09;1003.41;en>>
Furthermore, the practice of raising a child in accordance with the parent's religious conviction is universal to all religions and belief systems.

<<1003.41;1012.65;en>>
It is something that all religions and belief systems have in common, regardless of their ethnic, linguistic, and cultural roots.

<<1012.65;1023.77;en>>
A Hindu mother wants her child to be raised in Hinduism, a Jewish couple in Judaism, Christian parents in Christianity, and so on.

<<1023.77;1030.09;en>>
And we will all react if our children are raised by force in a different religion or conviction than our own.

<<1033.01;1039.33;en>>
The applicant, it is a natural expression of her faith to raise her child in accordance with Islam.

<<1039.33;1049.05;en>>
And state authorities have a positive obligation to guarantee the applicant this freedom, express her faith.

<<1049.05;1053.73;en>>
In this case, after the adoption, the foster parents became his legal parents.

<<1053.73;1064.89;en>>
By consenting to the adoption, the government also gave its consent to the foster parents to change the name and to baptize him in their Christian faith.

<<1064.89;1075.61;en>>
At the same time as the adoption was approved, the child was given a new forename to reflect his new religious identity and to raise his Muslim identity.

<<1075.61;1084.11;en>>
In fact, the foster parents stopped using the child's forename already shortly after he was placed with them over the objections of the applicant.

<<1084.11;1086.05;en>>
Please see the appendix 4 and 5.

<<1089.85;1096.05;en>>
The name change is highly relevant in this particular case, as it falls within the scope of Article 9.

<<1096.05;1097.85;en>>
And I will now demonstrate how.

<<1100.61;1105.57;en>>
The court has on previous occasions dealt with the significance of a child's first name.

<<1105.57;1116.45;en>>
The court's case law is regarded as issue is telling of whether Article 8 should be interpreted in light of Article 9, or whether there might be an independent violation of Article 9.

<<1116.45;1124.01;en>>
In Guillaume versus France, the court ruled that the choice of a child's forename by its parents falls within their private sphere.

<<1124.01;1130.25;en>>
Thus, the question of giving a child a certain name falls within the ambit of Article 8.

<<1130.25;1138.65;en>>
This view was upheld in later judgments, in Salonen versus Finland and in Johansson versus Finland.

<<1138.65;1149.81;en>>
Salonen versus Finland, the couple's request to give their daughter a specific first name was refused by the Finnish authorities, on the grounds that they did not comply with the domestic practice.

<<1149.81;1159.25;en>>
The applicant alleged in Teralia that the refusal to register their daughter's name violated the rights of freedom of thought under Article 9.

<<1159.25;1171.37;en>>
The commission had found that the applicants' complaint that their right to freedom of thought was violated by the refusal to register the proposed name did fall within the ambit of Article 9.

<<1171.37;1191.05;en>>
However, this particular application was declared inadmissible as a whole, because the commission did not find that the particular name the parents had wanted to give their daughter was, and I quote, a manifestation of any belief in the sense that some coherent view on fundamental problems can be seen as being expressed thereby.

<<1191.05;1198.77;en>>
The incident case, the first name given to the child by the applicant has a strong religious motivation and meaning.

<<1198.77;1202.01;en>>
The child was named after the Muslim prophet.

<<1202.01;1207.61;en>>
The name has an immediate religious connotation to everyone who hears it.

<<1207.61;1216.01;en>>
This particular name is also considered to be the superior name to give to a male child in Islam.

<<1216.01;1222.45;en>>
Therefore, the child's name also carries a significance that goes beyond the private domestic sphere.

<<1222.45;1226.41;en>>
The name connects the child to other practicing Muslims.

<<1226.41;1231.21;en>>
It is a marker of his religious belonging and identity.

<<1233.09;1238.93;en>>
This reasoning brings us right back to the core of Article 9.

<<1238.93;1244.25;en>>
Article 9 intersects with the content of other provisions in the convention.

<<1244.25;1247.81;en>>
Article 8 is often evoked alongside Article 9.

<<1247.81;1256.29;en>>
Holding a belief or conviction is deeply intimate and private matter that makes up the identity of any given individual.

<<1256.29;1261.41;en>>
Seen as such, Article 8 can be interpreted in the light of Article 9.

<<1261.41;1267.45;en>>
But exercising a particular religion or belief is not solely a private matter.

<<1267.45;1272.61;en>>
Freedom of religion or belief extends beyond the private and familial sphere.

<<1272.61;1285.33;en>>
Article 9 clearly states that everyone has the right to manifest their religion or belief either alone or in community with others and in public or in private.

<<1285.33;1290.97;en>>
For example, in gatherings or congregations with like-minded worshippers.

<<1290.97;1312.65;en>>
Also, if proselytizing falls within the scope of Article 9, as the court established in 1993 landmark judgment of Kokinakis versus Greece, the practice of raising a child within one's own family or a child within one's own religion falls within the scope of Article 9.

<<1312.65;1319.65;en>>
Raising a child within one's own religion is in fact fundamental to the fulfillment of religious freedom.

<<1319.65;1326.37;en>>
Parents have the right to ensure the religious and moral education of the children in conformity with their own conviction.

<<1326.37;1332.05;en>>
Article 9 is as closely interwoven with Article 2 of Protocol 1.

<<1332.05;1342.49;en>>
In the instant case, the applicant raised the issue of her child's religious education on numerous occasions, all of which are well documented.

<<1342.49;1347.37;en>>
She was time and again rebuffed by the child welfare services as bothersome.

<<1347.37;1355.13;en>>
At one point, she was told by the child welfare services, and here I quote, we cannot choose a religion or culture for our children.

<<1355.13;1358.45;en>>
See Appendix 6.

<<1358.45;1372.33;en>>
Applicant was instead told by the same child welfare services that her child would follow the daily life of the foster parents and their family, including eating pork and following them to the church.

<<1372.33;1381.29;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court, this is a violation of Article 2, Protocol 1.

<<1381.29;1387.57;en>>
The fact that a child is taken into care does not cause the parents to lose all their rights under Article 1.

<<1387.57;1392.65;en>>
See Olsen versus Sweden in paragraph 95.

<<1392.65;1401.41;en>>
In the judgment Folgerud and others versus Norway, the Grand Chamber set out the general principles of the interpretation of Article 2 of Protocol 1.

<<1401.41;1415.17;en>>
It held in paragraph 84, two sentences of Article 2 of Protocol 1 must be interpreted not only in the light of each other, but also in particular of Article 8, 9, and 10 of the convention.

<<1415.17;1423.65;en>>
The state is forbidden to pursue a name of indoctrination that might be considered as not representing parents' religious and philosophical convictions.

<<1423.65;1428.49;en>>
That is the limit that must not be exceeded.

<<1428.49;1441.29;en>>
Furthermore, the choice of foster family in this case contributed to the alienation of the child from the applicant since the foster family's religious convictions was so far removed from the applicants.

<<1441.29;1451.53;en>>
The negative effects of these choice were further aggravated by the fact that the foster family belongs to a Christian church that actively proselytizes.

<<1451.53;1463.93;en>>
As already observed, the word mission in the same name of the church refers to evangelizing, to the practice of seeking to convert others to Christianity.

<<1463.93;1478.41;en>>
The child's baptism into the Mission Common Church of Norway immediately after his adoption is thus a perfectly logical consequence, given the fact that he had been indoctrinated into this faith for years.

<<1478.41;1489.57;en>>
Against this background, the domestic courts do not really take into account the applicants' arguments relating to the alleged violation of Article 9 of the convention.

<<1489.57;1496.45;en>>
Let it be said that it is not a process against the foster parents who are now the adoptive parents.

<<1496.45;1500.37;en>>
It is a process against the Norwegian government.

<<1500.37;1513.17;en>>
The foster family had not been sufficiently informed by the Norwegian authorities about how to respect and take into account the religious identity of the foster child and their duties not to convert the child into their own religion.

<<1513.17;1519.93;en>>
The foster placement agreement enclosed in Appendix 20 says nothing about this issue.

<<1519.93;1530.21;en>>
Nor did the foster parents receive any training as regards their conduct during the visits by the applicant in relation to the possible religious differences.

<<1530.21;1543.57;en>>
Based on the circumstances of our case, there is a violation of Article 9 and or Article 2 of Protocol Number 1.

<<1543.57;1549.25;en>>
In the memorial, we also argue that Article 9 must be interpreted in light of Article 14.

<<1549.25;1561.21;en>>
That is because the rights expressed in Article 9 and other provisions of the conventions are supplemented by Article 14, which prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of those rights.

<<1561.21;1573.13;en>>
If the court finds that there has been a violation of the applicant's rights of freedom of religion under Article 9, the court must view it in conjunction with Article 14.

<<1573.13;1583.37;en>>
I come finally to the third point, the binding force and execution of judgment governed by Article 46 of the convention.

<<1583.37;1589.89;en>>
Article 46 applies to every judgment in which the court has found a breach of the convention.

<<1589.89;1601.89;en>>
The provision means that the court's findings impose on the responding state a legal obligation to put an end to the breach and make reparations for its consequences.

<<1601.89;1610.37;en>>
One recent judgment is especially relevant when we examine this question, as it resembles the facts of the instant case.

<<1610.37;1614.21;en>>
This judgment is Omurefe versus Spain.

<<1614.21;1625.01;en>>
The case is analyzed in the Norwegian article Decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in Cases of Protection of Private Life and Family Life 2019,2020.

<<1625.01;1627.69;en>>
See Appendix 17.

<<1627.69;1636.17;en>>
In Omurefe versus Spain, the applicant was a Nigerian national who was residing illegally in Spain at the time.

<<1636.17;1643.69;en>>
The applicant voluntarily let the child welfare services take on the care of her child when he was two months old.

<<1643.69;1655.85;en>>
She was then informed that the plan was a temporary placement with a view to reuniting her with her son in the medium term, provided that the care situation had improved.

<<1655.85;1665.41;en>>
However, shortly thereafter, the mother was deprived of parental responsibility and the child was placed in a foster home with a view to adoption.

<<1665.41;1670.09;en>>
All visitation contact between the applicant and the child was suspended.

<<1670.09;1673.25;en>>
The applicant lodged an appeal and was finally successful.

<<1673.25;1678.97;en>>
A domestic court awarded her one hour of contact, each month under supervision.

<<1678.97;1686.13;en>>
But in the meantime, the authorities proceeded with the adoption, which was carried out despite the applicant's objections.

<<1686.13;1689.89;en>>
In this case, the court found that there had been a violation of Article 8.

<<1689.89;1706.53;en>>
In the judgment, the court asked the national authorities to re-examine the situation of the applicant and her son in light of the judgment and to assess the possibilities for contact between the two, taking account of the child's situation and with the child's best interest in mind.

<<1706.53;1722.45;en>>
Furthermore, the court observed that under Article 46, the most appropriate way of redressing this type of violation would be to put the applicant in the same situation she would have been if the convention had not been violated.

<<1722.45;1727.29;en>>
The court delivered its judgment on 23rd June 2020.

<<1727.29;1731.37;en>>
The adoption of the child was authorized in October 2015.

<<1731.37;1737.21;en>>
While the child had been living with his foster parents since the summer of 2009.

<<1737.21;1747.57;en>>
This judgment is only available in French and I will read directly from it, paragraph 71.

<<1747.57;1792.89;en>>
The court considers that the most appropriate way of redressing a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, in a case such as this one, is to put the applicant in the same situation she would have been if the Convention had not been violated.

<<1792.89;1816.69;en>>
In Habedat v. Spain, a case which also concerned the taking of children into care following an adoption, the court reached a similar conclusion as to remedy granted.

<<1808.09;1816.69;en>>
This approach to reparation is also that which conforms the best to the general international law and the law of state responsibility.

<<1816.69;1852.77;en>>
As the Permanent International Court of Justice observed in the celebrated factory at Chorzow, and this decision is also cited by the court in Papamika Loupolos and others v. Greek in paragraph 36, reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.

<<1852.77;1859.13;en>>
The court has, however, not formulated similar conclusions in their decisions against Norway.

<<1859.13;1870.25;en>>
Therefore, we would like to ask the court to make a statement regarding this issue in the present case, its specific circumstances taken into consideration.

<<1870.25;1889.13;en>>
The Norwegian Civil Procedure Code provides in section 31 5 and 4 for reopening of cases where the judgment misapplied the Convention, not dissimilar to the Spanish provisions the court relied on and referred to in Omurafe v. Spain and Hadadal v. Spain.

<<1889.13;1904.33;en>>
To illustrate why it is important that the court adds the judgment's dispositive something regarding this issue, I make reference to the two new paper articles in appendix 18 and 19, which I have already mentioned before.

<<1904.33;1907.25;en>>
The articles show that the agent has adopted and propagated the view that a mere stipulation of a violation of an article of the Convention seems to be reparation in itself.

<<1919.45;1923.21;en>>
No domestic remedies are needed.

<<1923.21;1936.33;en>>
This is a dangerous approach because when such a position is expressed by a high-ranking official, the national courts may wrongfully be led to believe that cases such as the present one merit no further action.

<<1936.33;1949.85;en>>
And that the opportunity that exists within the national legal framework to reopen the case is only a remedy of procedural nature and the question merits no real examination.

<<1949.85;1953.93;en>>
I now come to my conclusion.

<<1953.93;1967.89;en>>
We gratefully adopt the submissions made by the parties intervening on behalf of the applicant, and those are the Czech government, the Turkish government and the Air Centre.

<<1967.89;1979.93;en>>
To conclude, in addition to the breach of Article 8 already found by the Chamber in its judgment, there has in the present case been a violation of Article 9 in conjunction with Article 2 of Protocol 1.

<<1979.93;1982.85;en>>
Mr. President, Members of the Court, those are my submissions.

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<1987.58;1989.18;en>>
Thank you very much, Ms. Lutina.

<<1989.18;1996.06;en>>
I can confirm that your oral intervention was heard clear and loudly without any kind of interruption.

<<1996.06;1997.34;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<1997.34;1999.14;en>>
I now call on Mr. Emberland.

<<1999.14;2000.14;en>>
You have the floor, please.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<2004.19;2009.19;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President, distinguished members of the Grand Chamber.

<<2010.91;2013.57;en>>
Many themes would have deserved attention today.

<<2014.59;2018.15;en>>
The government submission is divided in three separate sections.

<<2018.15;2025.87;en>>
They respond to issues raised in the applicants memorial and in the submissions of the third party intervenors.

<<2028.35;2046.07;en>>
In part one, I will argue for the Grand Chamber to affirm the general principles of interpretation in child welfare cases under Article 8 of the Convention, as they were established by the Grand Chamber in Strandlobben versus Norway on the 10th of September 2019.

<<2048.03;2066.83;en>>
Then in part two, I will show what measures Norwegian authorities took to aid the applicant in improving her caring and parental skills with regard to her son's extraordinary needs and how these measures and the plights of the child are reflected in the domestic decisions.

<<2068.79;2080.95;en>>
Finally, in part three, the government wishes to emphasize what domestic authorities did to find a foster home that was attuned to the boy's religious and cultural roots.

<<2080.95;2099.79;en>>
The government submits that Norwegian authorities have done all that could reasonably be expected in this regard and invites the Grand Chamber to find that the applicant's rights under the Convention have not been violated also when considering the religious and cultural aspects of the present case.

<<2102.91;2111.15;en>>
I turn to the first point, notably the general principles of interpretation of Article 8 of the Convention in child welfare cases.

<<2111.15;2118.59;en>>
16 months ago, the Grand Chamber by a majority adopted such principles in Strandlobben versus Norway.

<<2118.59;2125.79;en>>
They are set out in paragraphs 202 through 213 in that judgment.

<<2127.19;2138.59;en>>
In line with the fourth instance doctrine and the principle of subsidiarity, the Strandlobben principles provide for a procedural oversight of domestic authorities' practice.

<<2138.59;2152.63;en>>
They emphasize that the reasoning of domestic authorities' decisions must reflect the genuine, broad and up-to-date assessments of the competing interests of the children and their biological parents.

<<2153.59;2162.99;en>>
They also emphasize that it is consistent with Article 8 that ultimately the best interests of the individual child may have to prevail.

<<2162.99;2170.11;en>>
And this is also in line with the government's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

<<2170.11;2179.11;en>>
This procedural approach and the emphasis on the rights of the child had the support of 11 out of 17 judges.

<<2179.11;2189.11;en>>
A minority of 6 judges wished to go further in their control and to carry out a substantive scrutiny of Norwegian courts' decisions.

<<2190.31;2206.59;en>>
The government has explicitly stated to the courts in written observations in a number of cases after Strandlobben that Norway accepts the principles in Strandlobben as appropriate corrections to domestic authorities' practice.

<<2206.59;2218.59;en>>
This the government has also done in its communication with the Committee of Ministers in the course of reporting on the implementation of both the Strandlobben case and subsequent chamber judgments.

<<2218.59;2224.59;en>>
The action plan submitted to the Committee of Ministers has been enclosed to the government's memorial.

<<2224.59;2246.59;en>>
It shows, among other things, that Norwegian decision-makers, the Supreme Court, appellate courts, first instance courts, and municipal and state administrative authorities, in their practice in individual cases, now explicitly accommodate the directives in the court's case law following Strandlobben.

<<2246.59;2257.11;en>>
Also, the government is currently in the last legs of preparing a bill for a new Child Welfare Act, which also will reflect the court's directives.

<<2257.11;2263.11;en>>
Parliament, too, is very much concerned that the court's practice is implemented.

<<2263.11;2275.11;en>>
Let there be no doubt that Norway, through all three branches of government, has done and is doing its utmost to accommodate the court's requirements as they flow from the Strandlobben principles.

<<2275.11;2291.11;en>>
The government has observed that the Czech government, in their intervention in the present case, argues that the present Grand Chamber should further develop the criteria established in Strandlobben.

<<2291.11;2302.11;en>>
By this, the Czech government means that the Grand Chamber should substitute the procedural review with a substantive review that did not win favour at the court in 2019.

<<2302.11;2315.11;en>>
The Czech government has argued for this amendment to the general principles in third-party interventions in all child welfare cases against Norway the last year and a half.

<<2315.11;2326.11;en>>
The Norwegian government has further observed at the court, since Strandlobben has adopted altogether six chamber judgments against Norway that concern child welfare measures.

<<2326.11;2350.11;en>>
While they formally professed their allegiance to the Grand Chamber, while they formally professed their allegiance to the procedural review of Strandlobben, the concrete assessments in all of them have elements of substantive scrutiny that do not clearly reflect the principles set forth in paragraphs 202 through 213 of the judgment.

<<2350.11;2364.11;en>>
The government has also observed that the court in those cases has made no clear mention of the individual children's individual interests and the relevance in the overall assessment to be made.

<<2364.11;2366.11;en>>
This gives some reason for concern.

<<2366.11;2370.11;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of this court,

<<2370.11;2386.11;en>>
the court has stated time and again that it is in the interest of legal certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law, that it should not depart without good reason from precedents laid down in previous cases.

<<2386.11;2404.11;en>>
As we currently said, that good reason equals essentially the court responding to changing conditions within the respondent states and within contracting states generally, for example, to any evolving convergence as to the standards to be achieved.

<<2404.11;2416.11;en>>
Departure from settled law should, in other words, be informed by external factors in the form of changes in the practice of the member states of the Council of Europe.

<<2416.11;2437.11;en>>
My government with respect submits that there has been no relevant development to suggest that the present ground chamber should amend the general principles of interpretation adopted-

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<2437.57;2439.53;en>>
Emberland, sorry for interrupting you, Emberland.

<<2439.53;2442.79;en>>
We just lost you for half a minute or something like that.

<<2442.79;2445.35;en>>
Could you just go a little bit back and then continue again?

<<2445.35;2445.35;en>>
Thank you.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<2446.57;2447.91;en>>
I will retrace. Thank you.

<<2452.25;2469.49;en>>
I start with saying that the court has stated time and again that it is in the interest of legal certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law, that it should not depart without good reason from precedence laid down in previous cases.

<<2469.49;2486.64;en>>
The Grand Chamber has recurrently said that good reason equals essentially the court responding to changing conditions within the respondent state and within contracting states generally, for example, to any evolving convergence as to the standards to be achieved.

<<2486.64;2497.85;en>>
Departure from settled law should, in other words, be informed by external factors in the form of changes in the practice of the Member States of the Council of Europe.

<<2497.85;2510.25;en>>
My government, with respect, submits that there has been no relevant development to suggest that the present chamber should amend the general principles of interpretation adopted merely 16 months ago.

<<2510.25;2531.97;en>>
Further, and this is also laid out in detail in the government's memorial, the court itself in its practice since September 2019 has referred to the Stranglöppen principles as the guiding norm in at least 18 judgments and published decisions against other states and in cases against Norway, the court now refers to them as well established case law.

<<2531.97;2543.81;en>>
Consequently, the court intends to resolve a number of remaining cases against Norway pursuant to the well established case law procedure in Article 28 of the Convention.

<<2543.81;2563.97;en>>
It would be prudent for the purposes of legal certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law at the Grand Chamber in the present case states that paragraphs 202 through 213 of Stranglöppen remain the general principles of interpretation as far as Article 8 of the Convention is concerned.

<<2563.97;2569.97;en>>
I therefore invite the present Grand Chamber to affirm the approach in Stranglöppen.

<<2569.97;2586.41;en>>
Their correctives reflect the principles of subsidiarity, the complexities of such cases, the fact that all cases need individual consideration and the importance of protecting the interests of the children as well as those of the parents.

<<2586.41;2600.25;en>>
The Norwegian government on this point fully agrees with the Danish government, third party intervention in the present case and I refer to Denmark's submission.

<<2600.25;2627.12;en>>
I now move to my second point, what Norwegian authorities did to assist the applicant while she cared for her son, as well as after the care order was issued for her to be able to reunite with the boy and how these measures have been thoroughly assessed and reflected in the domestic decisions, which in the end found that the boy's interests had to prevail over those of the applicant.

<<2627.12;2630.93;en>>
It is important to underscore this for several reasons.

<<2630.93;2639.85;en>>
First, the applicant in her memorial claims that the authorities never had the aim of pursuing reunification.

<<2639.85;2656.68;en>>
Further, the air centre, the Czech government and the Turkish government in their submissions appear to believe that domestic authorities did not genuinely seek reunification and that they failed to undertake steps in this regard.

<<2656.69;2665.05;en>>
Third, the chamber was of the opinion that insufficient weight was attached to the aim that the applicant and ex enjoy family life.

<<2665.05;2680.29;en>>
And the chamber had difficulties in seeing that the domestic authorities may be said to have taken any real measures to facilitate family reunification in the longer term after the care order had been issued.

<<2680.29;2691.93;en>>
The chamber also doubted the necessity of the contact regime that was in place and what could be drawn from contact sessions between the applicant and her son.

<<2691.93;2709.97;en>>
With respect, Mr. President, the facts do not support these assumptions and the views also do not sufficiently address the predicaments of the applicant's son and his rights to have his physical and mental well-being protected under the convention.

<<2709.97;2724.73;en>>
Three years passed from the boy was placed in an emergency care home on the 6th of November 2010 to the municipal child welfare office initially applied for foster parent adoption on the 11th of September 2013.

<<2724.73;2730.77;en>>
And adoption was ultimately confirmed by the courts two years later.

<<2730.77;2738.33;en>>
What measures did the authorities adopt within this period and what really drove the authorities to suggest adoption?

<<2738.33;2745.73;en>>
These matters are well reflected in the domestic court decisions.

<<2745.73;2754.73;en>>
The government's memorial to the grand chamber refers to several assistant measures that were adopted both prior to the emergency order and after that date.

<<2754.73;2765.57;en>>
They include the initial and comprehensive follow up from two asylum centers due to concern for the care provided for the boy after arrival in Norway.

<<2765.57;2779.85;en>>
It was then provided for the applicant to live in the house of professional contracted by the municipality to help assist and to guide the applicant who at the time lived with the boy.

<<2779.85;2790.73;en>>
From January 2011, the applicant for two years stayed in a shared house for a single minor asylum seekers where she was followed up day and night by therapists.

<<2790.73;2800.12;en>>
Then in January 2013, she moved into a flat in a shared house where staff followed her up regularly.

<<2800.12;2806.81;en>>
The case file shows that she throughout received continuous and systematic training in everyday activities.

<<2806.81;2813.33;en>>
She received professional follow up amounting to a 30 percent of a full time position.

<<2813.33;2820.93;en>>
She was also afforded considerable medical and educational assistance and operation improved her hearing impairments.

<<2820.93;2827.29;en>>
As for considerable assistance, she completed secondary school and started high school.

<<2827.29;2836.97;en>>
Also in the relevant three year period, the applicant was granted contact sessions every other month with the boy.

<<2836.97;2849.41;en>>
All these measures were conducive of aiding the applicant in maturing, becoming independent and be able to act as a responsible adult that could again look after the boy.

<<2849.41;2857.69;en>>
The fact is, however, that the applicant did not show any improvements in her caring skills towards the child during these three years.

<<2857.69;2871.2;en>>
Reports from the contact sessions, including those from independent experts appointed by domestic courts, show that the applicants continue to display this regard for the child's needs.

<<2871.2;2882.25;en>>
At the same time, there is ample evidence that the child had extraordinary needs that had to be addressed and that he reacted strongly to the contact sessions.

<<2882.25;2893.85;en>>
The boy's needs for stability and care saturate the documents from all domestic proceedings, and they are reiterated in Section 2.3 of the government's memorial.

<<2893.85;2908.93;en>>
The interest of the boy ultimately had to prevail over those of the applicant, totally in line with the Stroudlobbin dictum that the child's best interests must come before all other considerations.

<<2908.93;2923.2;en>>
The Chamber, in its reasoning, appears to have relied on parts of the High Court judgments of 2015, which decided on foster parent adoption as its primary source of reference.

<<2923.2;2930.85;en>>
This is perhaps not surprising, as the applicant's complaint formally builds on this judgment.

<<2930.85;2942.64;en>>
But as the High Court considered adoption only, it did not directly restate all details of the measures that had been offered to the applicant at prior stages.

<<2942.64;2954.57;en>>
But the High Court judgment explicitly stated that it relied upon the findings of the District Court and the County Social Welfare Board's decisions with regard to adoption.

<<2954.57;2972.85;en>>
And these decisions, in turn, refer to the set of judgments and decisions that in 2010 and 2011, considered the care order where the assessment of measures adopted to facilitate reunification took center stage.

<<2972.85;2989.09;en>>
All instances took besides into account and assessed the reports from numerous experts, where details about assistant measures and what contact sessions showed were fleshed out in detail.

<<2989.09;3010.41;en>>
The High Court judgment and all its predecessors also had regard to the needs of the boy, what his extraordinary predicaments were in the relevant period and why, after three years of balancing the competing interests of the applicant and her son, it was deemed imperative to prioritize the child's needs over those of his mother.

<<3010.41;3028.49;en>>
By contrast, it is noteworthy that the individual needs of the boy are more or less completely unmentioned in the applicant's memorial, in the third party interventions submitted in support of a case and in the concrete assessment carried out by the chamber.

<<3028.49;3048.81;en>>
Mr. President, the decisions of the Norwegian courts are comprehensive in their reasoning, both with regards to facts and law, but one will in no case find all necessary information of the facts and their evidence spelled out word by word in one single document.

<<3048.81;3066.33;en>>
The court supervision of domestic court decisions must acknowledge how a multiple instance system of the decision, domestic decision making functions in practice and account for it when carrying out its oversight.

<<3066.33;3076.53;en>>
The government has furnished the court with all relevant court and board decisions in English translation, and most of the expert opinions have been translated for the court's convenience.

<<3076.53;3088.12;en>>
The grand chamber should take particular note of the following that clearly separate the present case from what fell short of the court scrutiny in Strømlobben.

<<3088.12;3104.16;en>>
First, the relevant court and board decisions are comprehensively reasoned and they generally, at length and in detail, account for the applicant's interests, which are weighed against those of the child.

<<3104.16;3112.73;en>>
Second, the decisions are based on and they reflect a massive amount of up-to-date evidentiary material at each stage of proceedings.

<<3112.73;3124.97;en>>
In fact, altogether, seven different independent expert opinions were procured in the process, and they form an important basis of the decisions taken by domestic courts.

<<3124.97;3145.65;en>>
When considering the totality of evidence, which is reflected in the domestic decisions, the grand chamber will observe that comprehensive assistant measures were in place and that a number of measures were taken to ensure that the applicant could function as an adult care person in the life of the boy.

<<3145.65;3158.81;en>>
In the end, the facts show that the applicant was not capable of providing the required care, and based on a very thorough evidentiary basis, the boy's needs therefore had to take priority.

<<3158.81;3174.16;en>>
This was not done lightly, and as the material also shows, opinions differed both among experts and decision makers as to what ultimately was the appropriate solution at the different stages and in the end.

<<3174.16;3177.73;en>>
But this is also a reality of domestic decision making.

<<3177.73;3184.57;en>>
The courts of justice must decide, and if views differ, the court's opinion must prevail.

<<3184.57;3211.89;en>>
In the present case, the high court by a majority in 2015 ultimately found sufficient reason to consent to the boy's adoption, as the evidence demonstrated that reunification and the prospect of the applicant being able to care for her son were untenable despite a host of measures taken for a period of more than four years to assist in attaining these goals.

<<3211.89;3220.65;en>>
Finally, the government will turn to the religious and cultural perspectives of the present case.

<<3220.65;3229.01;en>>
In the memorial, the government has argued that they can be accommodated within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention.

<<3229.01;3240.85;en>>
If the Grand Chamber finds that they should be subsumed under another provision of the Convention, the government submits that Article 9 is more suitable than Article 2 of Protocol 1.

<<3240.85;3255.53;en>>
As the facts of the case go beyond the educational context that Article 2 of Protocol 1 primarily regulates, this is dealt with in detail in Section 5 of the government's memorial.

<<3255.53;3264.81;en>>
Regardless of which provision is chosen, however, the rights of the applicant must be balanced against what was the best solution for the boy.

<<3264.81;3295.05;en>>
The applicant in her memorial erroneously submits that no attempts were made to find culturally matched foster placements, and that domestic authorities did not satisfy the requirement in Section 415 of the Norwegian Child Welfare Act that appropriate consideration shall be made to the child's ethnic, religious, cultural, and linguistic background.

<<3295.05;3313.69;en>>
And the Turkish government in their submission states that it is not clear whether the national authorities have conducted a thorough assessment on the choice of the foster parents and exhausted all other available options before placing the child into foster care with a different religion.

<<3313.69;3337.01;en>>
The Chamber, for its part, did not visibly consider the measures taken by the authorities to find a Muslim foster home and made, in fact, scarce mentioning of the case's religious and cultural perspectives, while they were dealt with at length by domestic courts, including in the High Court judgment in 2015.

<<3337.01;3348.57;en>>
Again, the government invites the Grand Chamber to review the domestic court decisions closely, and I wish to make two remarks in this respect.

<<3348.57;3359.81;en>>
First, I refer to Section 2.8 of the government's memorial, where the High Court assessment of the religious and cultural aspects have been rendered in full.

<<3359.81;3377.97;en>>
The High Court heard and relied on the witness statements of two experts on Islam regarding the adoption of a Muslim boy with Christian foster parents, and had considerable and detailed regard to the applicants' and the boy's interests in having their faith respected.

<<3377.97;3392.77;en>>
In the view of the government, the High Court's reasoning might inspire the Grand Chamber's accommodation of the religious and cultural aspects, regardless of which provision of the Convention is deemed to be the right one.

<<3392.77;3408.69;en>>
Second, the government has observed that the High Court assumed that there were no available foster parents with a more similar cultural background, and it said that it was known that there is a serious shortage of foster parents with minority backgrounds.

<<3408.69;3424.81;en>>
The High Court stated, moreover, that further information about which assessments were made by the Child Welfare Service when a child was placed in a foster home with ethnically Norwegian parents did not emerge during the presentation of evidence.

<<3424.81;3433.61;en>>
This might be true, as the choice of foster home was not an issue when the High Court in 2015 decided on the foster parents' adoption.

<<3433.61;3441.97;en>>
These statements may lead one to believe that such matters were not duly considered by domestic courts.

<<3441.97;3453.77;en>>
Yet the High Court in the same paragraph referred to the County Social Welfare Board's consideration of these matters five years prior, when the choice of foster parents was indeed at the centre of attention.

<<3453.77;3478.01;en>>
In its decision on 10 December 2010, the Board said as follows, and I quote, Nothing would be better than if the Child Welfare Service, in cooperation with the Office for Children, Youth and Family Affairs, managed to find a foster home that can be deemed capable to address to the special ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic considerations in this case.

<<3478.01;3492.01;en>>
The Board therefore expects this possibility to be looked into as far as time permits, which will in a normal way leave the further work of choosing a placement to the Child Welfare Service, end of quote.

<<3492.01;3499.01;en>>
It also transpires from the same Board decision that the applicant had asked for the boy to be placed with a relative.

<<3499.01;3513.89;en>>
But the applicant in the subsequent district court proceedings renounced that claim for placement in a Muslim foster home out of consideration for the boy's attachment to his foster parents at the time.

<<3513.89;3529.41;en>>
Mr. President, evidence shows that the Child Welfare Service did indeed attempt to find an appropriate Muslim foster home for the boy, in line with the Board's statement that I just cited.

<<3529.41;3537.05;en>>
I refer to the Government's Memorial Section 2.6, where these efforts are rendered in detail.

<<3537.05;3557.12;en>>
The Child Welfare Service considered not only the applicant's relative as a candidate, but also two other Muslim foster homes, but for fully legitimate reasons decided against all of them, also having regard to the child's extraordinary needs and his need for an imminent placement.

<<3557.12;3572.97;en>>
The Child Welfare Service was, for that matter, also required to search for a Muslim foster home by virtue of domestic law and regulations, as is further detailed in the Government's Memorial Section 3.10.

<<3572.97;3588.45;en>>
The Government agrees with the applicant and the Turkish Government that the Member States or the Council of Europe shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that children are cared for by foster parents who share their religious and cultural backgrounds.

<<3588.45;3598.97;en>>
But the decisions taken in the present case show that Norwegian authorities acted with due diligence in this regard, consistent with the Convention's requirements.

<<3598.97;3618.77;en>>
A legal framework was in place, and the general measures undertaken to attain this goal have been actively pursued for many years, as is evidenced by two research reports that have been submitted to the Grand Chamber as annexes 58 and 59 to the Government's Memorial.

<<3618.77;3644.09;en>>
In this particular case, however, the ideal outcome could not be attained simply because of the scarcity of appropriate Muslim foster homes in reasonable proximity to the applicant and having regard to other aspects of the boy's needs and those affiliated with his faith, notably his well-being and what was considered best for him.

<<3644.09;3658.53;en>>
For these reasons, the Grand Chamber is invited to conclude that the applicant's rights under the Convention have not been violated, also when considering in the cases religious and cultural aspects.

<<3658.53;3658.53;en>>
This concludes the Government's intervention. I thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<3666.64;3685.88;en>>
Thank you Mr. Emberland. I can confirm that your oral intervention was heard clearly and without any interruption. I thank both parties for their submissions and I now invite the judges of the Grand Chamber wishing to do so to put their questions to the parties.

<<3685.88;3689.96;en>>
The first question will be from Judge Arnfinn Bårdsen. You have the floor please.

[[Judge;Arnfinn Bårdsen]]

<<3691.23;3694.07;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<3694.07;3702.19;en>>
The case was referred to the Grand Chamber of the Court based on the applicant's request related to Article 9.

<<3702.19;3721.23;en>>
I take, however, note that the agent of the Norwegian government, both in the written submissions and now during the hearing this morning, has entered into close to a full-fledged reassessment, also under Article 8, where the chamber unanimously found a violation.

<<3721.23;3737.13;en>>
I have two closely interconnected questions to the agent of the Norwegian government related to the government's position on the interpretation and application of Article 8 taken in isolation, leaving out now the issues under Article 9.

<<3737.13;3746.51;en>>
Of course, the representative of the applicant is free to address these questions, too, should she so wish.

<<3746.51;3769.15;en>>
I read the Norwegian government's written submissions to the effect that it agrees with the Starnloeben principles, as did the Norwegian Supreme Court in its Grand Chamber follow rulings 27 March late and subsequent follow-up rulings from that court since then, in parallel with this court's follow-up judgments.

<<3769.15;3774.95;en>>
The government's position appears to be confirmed by the oral pleadings this morning.

<<3774.95;3776.81;en>>
My first question is this.

<<3776.81;3796.03;en>>
Have I understood the Norwegian government position correctly, that the government agrees with the Starrloeben principles in their full range, and now forcefully ask the Grand Chamber of the court both to guard these principles and to apply them?

<<3796.03;3838.55;en>>
Assuming that the agent will answer this first question in the affirmative, my second question is whether the Norwegian government also accept this court's reading of Starnloeben, as this reading transpires from the court's application of the Starn Loeben principles in subsequent chamber judgments, such as KO and VM versus Norway, November 2019, AS versus Norway, December 2019, Peterson and others versus Norway, 10 March 2020, and Herne Hult versus Norway, 10 March 2020.

<<3838.55;3845.75;en>>
I need to expound some more on the context and substance of this second question.

<<3845.75;3853.95;en>>
I remind you that these four Norwegian chamber judgments are all unanimous in finding a violation of Article 8.

<<3853.95;3857.99;en>>
They were decided by alternating chamber formations.

<<3857.99;3864.71;en>>
They all refer to and explicitly state that they apply the Starnloeben principles.

<<3864.71;3866.75;en>>
And they are all final.

<<3866.75;3879.99;en>>
After the Grand Chamber panel in September last rejected the Norwegian government's request for having the two of them, Peterson and others, and Herne Hult referred to the Grand Chamber.

<<3879.99;3893.19;en>>
Apart from the fact that the chamber judgment in the current case is not final, Abdi Ibrahim blends apparently squarely and seamlessly into this group of cases.

<<3893.19;3903.99;en>>
The same can be said about the most recent judgment against Norway on this issue, namely ML versus Norway, 22 December 2020.

<<3903.99;3913.83;en>>
In addition, the Starnloeben principles have, of course, been referred to and applied by the court in a number of parallel judgments against other member states.

<<3913.83;3928.83;en>>
I note here that the government's argument before the Grand Chamber panel in Peterson and others and in Herne Hult was that the chamber judgment in those two cases did not represent a correct application of Starnloeben.

<<3928.83;3950.15;en>>
Moreover, the Norwegian government's arguments before the Grand Chamber panel in those cases were apparently quite similar to those submitted now before the Grand Chamber in this current case, notably arguments in substance related to a lack of deference to the assessment carried out by the domestic authorities.

<<3950.15;3957.67;en>>
That is, too little subsidiarity, too little margin of appreciation, too much substantial review.

<<3957.67;3966.43;en>>
And that the court laid too little emphasis on the best interest of the child, but rather gave priority to the biological parents.

<<3966.43;3975.47;en>>
I also note that the Norwegian government did not ask for the current case, Abdi Ibrahim, to be referred to the Grand Chamber.

<<3975.47;3987.47;en>>
Nonetheless, the old argument that the Norwegian chamber judgments following up Starn Loeben are not really in compliance with Starn Loeben, but represent rather an extension, is apparently still alive.

<<3987.47;3992.59;en>>
The alleged errors in the chamber are in substance not case specific.

<<3992.59;3994.99;en>>
The core critique is systemic.

<<3994.99;4002.83;en>>
Going to the court's role and the level and character of the European control mechanism under the convention.

<<4002.83;4014.91;en>>
Indeed, we recognize the gist of these arguments in the submissions made before the Grand Chamber in the current case by the intervening Danish government in referral also to the Copenhagen Declaration.

<<4014.91;4019.87;en>>
So finally, here is the real substance of my second question.

<<4019.87;4038.31;en>>
Taking into account the context that I have now just briefly described, and that in cases like this one, where the family ties are cut completely and permanently over, the threshold under Article 8 is indeed very high.

<<4038.31;4049.15;en>>
And the court applies, according to Starn Loeben, stricter scrutiny, which will inevitably also narrow the margin of appreciation.

<<4049.15;4070.43;en>>
Would it at all be possible for the court to not finding a violation of Article 8 in this case, as it now stands, without also in the same vein calling into question not only the bulk of chamber judgments handed down subsequently to Starn Loeben, but also Starn Loeben itself?

<<4070.43;4085.47;en>>
Is the government not in reality, by the character of its arguments, in fact inviting the Grand Chamber of the court to reopen Starn Loeben as precedence and take one or more steps back?

<<4085.47;4104.83;en>>
And even if this is not the intention of the government, would there not be a real risk that a Grand Chamber judgment not finding a violation of Article 8, based on the arguments forwarded by the government, would be perceived as watering down the Starn Loeben principles?

<<4104.83;4108.07;en>>
I apologize for having used so much valuable time.

<<4108.07;4110.43;en>>
And I thank you for your patience, Mr. President.

<<4110.43;4115.07;en>>
And I thank the agent for the Norwegian government in advance for his replies to my inquiries.

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<4117.56;4118.4;en>>
Thank you.

<<4118.4;4120.84;en>>
I'll now give the floor to George O'Leary for a question.

[[Judge;Síofra O’Leary]]

<<4124.41;4126.33;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4126.33;4141.05;en>>
In paragraph 119 of their submissions, the Norwegian government highlight the fact that Article 2 of Protocol Number 1 did not feature in the application to the court or in the referral request.

<<4141.05;4145.83;en>>
Presumably because of the former, the chamber didn't address this article.

<<4145.83;4155.49;en>>
So could the parties explain why Article 2 of Protocol 1 can now be considered to fall within the scope of the case before the Grand Chamber?

<<4155.49;4163.57;en>>
And is the government in paragraph 119 pointing to a possible exhaustion problem in relation to this article?

<<4163.57;4163.57;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<4167.2;4169.62;en>>
And the next question is from Judge Lemmens.

<<4169.62;4170.12;en>>
You have the floor.

[[Judge;Paul Lemmens]]

<<4173.14;4174.14;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4175.42;4177.1;en>>
I actually have two questions.

<<4177.82;4179.86;en>>
One is primarily to the government.

<<4182.04;4199.7;en>>
We have heard both parties arguing extensively on the one hand that the authorities did not do enough to find a family with the same or a similar ethnic, religious or cultural background, or the other party said the authorities did enough.

<<4199.7;4224.28;en>>
Assuming that indeed it was not possible to find such a family, were there nevertheless other restrictions relating to the choice of a foster family among families that do not have the same characteristics as the applicant?

<<4225.52;4237.22;en>>
So it's not only, my question is, is there not only a question of trying to find the appropriate family, but also avoiding other families?

<<4237.22;4239.26;en>>
And how does that work in practice?

<<4240.64;4245.64;en>>
And the second question is primarily directed to the applicant.

<<4246.88;4261.34;en>>
I heard when the applicant was arguing about Article 9 that at a given moment, but she did not seem, the lawyer did not seem to develop that, she spoke of the positive obligations under Article 9.

<<4262.5;4268.14;en>>
Could the applicant explain what the complaint is about?

<<4268.14;4278.22;en>>
Is it about an interference by the state in freedom of religion or about a failure to fulfill a positive obligation under Article 9?

<<4278.22;4278.22;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<4281.48;4284.44;en>>
Thank you very much and I give the floor to Pastor Vilanova.

<<4284.44;4285.44;en>>
Please.

[[Judge;Pere Pastor Vilanova]]

<<4287.98;4291.5;fr>>
Merci beaucoup, monsieur le Président.

<<4292.02;4301.86;fr>>
J'ai deux questions, une destinée à la représentante de la requérante et la deuxième destinée à l'agent du gouvernement.

<<4302.94;4309.14;fr>>
Commençons donc par la question destinée à la représentante de la requérante.

<<4309.9;4322.42;fr>>
Si j'ai bien compris, aujourd'hui, pendant votre pléthorie, vous avez demandé la réouverture de la procédure interne en base de l'article 46, si j'ai bien compris.

<<4322.74;4324.74;fr>>
J'aimerais bien que vous le confirmiez.

<<4325.18;4337.54;fr>>
Si tel est le cas, pour autant que j'ai bien compris votre position devant la Chambre, vous n'avez pas demandé telle possibilité.

<<4337.86;4349.7;fr>>
Est-ce que vous pouvez expliquer à quoi est dû ce changement de position et pourquoi introduisez-vous, si tel est le cas, devant la Grande Chambre cette nouvelle prétention?

<<4350.02;4357.46;fr>>
Ma deuxième question se dirige particulièrement à l'agent du gouvernement.

<<4357.78;4371.86;fr>>
Le gouvernement que vous représentez n'a pas effectué aucune demande de renvoi du jugement de la Chambre.

<<4371.86;4386.34;fr>>
Donc, normalement, s'il n'y a pas de pétition de renvoi, cela devrait normalement nous laisser entendre que le gouvernement était d'accord avec le jugement de la Chambre.

<<4387.7;4407.5;fr>>
Or, dans votre mémoire, présentée devant la Grande Chambre le 25 novembre 2020, au niveau de vos conclusions, notamment au niveau du paragraphe 166, vous demandez à ce que la Chambre conclue à la non-violation en solitaire de l'article 8.

<<4409.26;4415.34;fr>>
Pouvez-vous, s'il vous plaît, nous expliquer la raison de cette apparente contradiction?

<<4415.34;4415.34;fr>>
Je vous remercie.

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<4420.45;4423.89;en>>
And the next questions will come from Judge Motoc, please.

<<4423.89;4423.89;en>>
You had the floor.

[[Judge;Iulia Antoanella Motoc]]

<<4430.17;4432.17;fr>>
Merci beaucoup monsieur le Président.

<<4432.17;4515.89;fr>>
Ma première question est plutôt factuelle, elle est un peu liée à la première question du juge Lemmens. Il y a une contradiction entre ce que la récurrente et le gouvernement disent par rapport aux essais que le gouvernement, les autorités norvégiennes ont fait de trouver une famille d'accueil pour le fils de récurrente, une famille qui soit d'origine somalienne ou de croyance musulmane. Donc je voudrais que les deux parties répètent quels sont

<<4432.17;4515.89;fr>>
vraiment ces essais, comment sont passés et j'ai une question subséquente, est-ce que, qui est posée au gouvernement, est-ce que le gouvernement et les autorités norvégiennes ont pensé de trouver aussi une famille séculière vu la position de la récurrente mais aussi les experts dans la croyance musulmane qui expliquent le fait que être né musulman signifie complètement différemment autre chose par rapport à des autres croyances. Ça c'est ma première question.

<<4515.89;4564.53;fr>>
Ma deuxième question est relative à la façon dont les deux parties voient le rapport entre l'article 9 de la convention et l'article 2 du protocole 1 parce qu'il me semble que la récurrente avait fait des propos par rapport à la cour de trouver une violation de l'article 9 en relation avec cet article 2 tandis que le gouvernement nous a dit que l'article 9 sans doute il est plus large. Donc quelle sera la préférence du gouvernement et de la récurrente par rapport au rapport entre ces deux articles? Merci beaucoup.

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<4569.03;4573.15;en>>
Thank you. And the next judge asking questions is Yudkivska. You have the floor.

[[Judge;Ganna Yudkivska]]

<<4575.21;4576.57;en>>
Thank you, President.

<<4576.57;4585.53;en>>
My question echoes questions put by judges Lemmens and Motoc on Article 9, but it goes to the applicant.

<<4585.53;4611.33;en>>
In your memorial, you relied heavily on the case of Tenenbaum versus Sweden, that concerned decision by the Swedish authorities to place their daughters in a Protestant foster family rather than a Jewish one, although they were Jewish, in which the commission stressed on the principles that the authorities were obliged to take into consideration the applicants' wish to have their children be placed in Jewish foster home.

<<4611.33;4615.85;en>>
And you rightly say that this applies in the present case as well.

<<4615.85;4640.25;en>>
However, in the Tenenbaum, the commission declared this complaint inadmissible because, I quote, the social authorities explored the possibilities of placing the children in a Jewish foster home, but their endeavors failed because of the other considerations, such as the difficulty to find, without any unnecessary waste of time, relevant home not far from the parents.

<<4640.25;4649.89;en>>
In the present case, authorities explored three options of placing the applicant's son to a Muslim family not far from the applicant's home.

<<4649.89;4655.57;en>>
They all failed before placing him in a Christian foster home.

<<4655.57;4666.37;en>>
So my question is, where do you see the differences between these two situations that would justify, in your view, departure from the findings in the Tenenbaum case?

<<4666.37;4666.37;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<4669.62;4670.38;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4670.38;4693.58;en>>
These were the questions asked by the judges and the court will now withdraw for approximately 25 minutes and resume again 11.45, following which the parties will be able to submit brief observations in reply to each other's submissions as well as to questions from the judges.

<<4693.58;4697.1;en>>
The hearing is now suspended.

[[Announcer;UNK]]

<<4870.13;4870.89;fr>>
La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<4877.06;4879.36;en>>
The hearing is now resumed.

<<4879.36;4894.2;en>>
May I draw your attention to the fact that the judges will have the possibility, after having heard the answers provided by the parties, to ask clarifications concerning these answers without, however, asking any new questions.

<<4894.2;4895.92;en>>
I call on Ms. Lutina.

<<4895.92;4896.76;en>>
You have the floor, please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<4900.56;4901.84;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4903.52;4915.04;en>>
First, I would like to address and clarify something that was said by the states, by the government's agent in his submissions.

<<4915.04;4953.24;en>>
Because relating to revision of the judgment delivered by the chamber in the present case and revision of a found violation of Article 8, the government's agent stated that the national courts had done a very good assessment of the measures that were made towards the reunification of the applicant and her child, and that the domestic authorities had done everything that they could to reunify the child with the applicant.

<<4953.24;4981.32;en>>
And here I would like to point out that there are two factual errors, because one error is that indeed the applicant underwent changes and follow-ups and improvements in her ability for self-care, something that we also documented well in our submissions to the national courts when the case was pending before them.

<<4981.32;5012.88;en>>
However, the national authorities stated that the improved ability to self-care did not signify that the applicant's ability to care for her child had improved, and that they were, and then they didn't go into any specific assessment relating to that point, because the domestic authorities simply dismissed it as not relevant to the case.

<<5012.88;5022.76;en>>
The other point is that the contact regime that was established between the applicant and her child was not followed up thoroughly.

<<5022.76;5027.2;en>>
This was also my submission before the Chamber.

<<5027.2;5034.91;en>>
At the end, towards the adoption procedures, the whole visitation schedule had collapsed.

<<5034.91;5058.88;en>>
The Child Welfare Services, although there was a binding judgment where guaranteed one hour six times per year, those visits were not carried out according to the schedule, because the Child Welfare Services on their own decided that was not in the best interests of the child.

<<5058.88;5077.4;en>>
Thus, there had gone quite a while between the last time the applicant saw her child, and the next time she saw him again was in connection with a psychological evaluation done for this case.

<<5077.4;5083.76;en>>
And I believe we're talking about an interval of six months.

<<5083.76;5087.84;en>>
So there was indeed no aim at re-ifying the family.

<<5087.84;5107.68;en>>
Also point out that it had gone only two years from the district court's delivered its judgment in December 2010, that the child should be placed in foster care, and the adoption proceedings began.

<<5107.68;5117.72;en>>
Actually, when I think about it, it was one and a half years, because the proceedings for the adoption began in September 2013.

<<5117.72;5132.72;en>>
That's meaning that it had not elapsed enough time to conclude that the applicant was for all time not fit to be a mother, and that the child could not benefit from any contact with his mother.

<<5132.72;5133.84;en>>
Thank you.

<<5133.84;5141.95;en>>
Now I go over to the questions that a member of the court posed to the applicant.

<<5141.95;5147.88;en>>
I start with Judge O'Leary.

<<5147.88;5163.64;en>>
There should be found a violation of Article 9, but Article 2 of Protocol 1 is lex specialis, and because it is lex specialis, it gives content to Article 9.

<<5163.64;5170.76;en>>
But thus, having said that, we are entirely satisfied with the violation of Article 9.

<<5170.76;5177.76;en>>
And in any event, the court knows its law, curia novit iudia.

<<5177.76;5213.72;en>>
And also, I would like to point out that submissions made by the applicant throughout the entire national process has been there, that the Child Welfare Services had not provided her with the right to raise and educate her child in accordance with her faith, although the factual submissions were not submitted under Article 2 of Protocol 1.

<<5213.72;5224.2;en>>
Further, I move on to the questions from Judge Lemmens regarding a positive obligation in Article 9.

<<5224.2;5230.04;en>>
It is a negative obligation not to make this specific decision.

<<5230.04;5245.91;en>>
It has also been an interference with the applicant's rights under Article 9, such as national authorities had handled the case.

<<5245.91;5261.24;en>>
And now, I move on to Judge Vilanova and the question there.

<<5264.36;5274.32;en>>
Why do we raise the question of Article 46 when this submission was not raised previously at previous stages?

<<5274.32;5288.2;en>>
This is because now we see that the government in their submissions, they want to have the chamber judgment reviewed.

<<5288.2;5309.64;en>>
They have made this submission now in court, and that this approach that the government has adopted towards the chamber judgment in all the other cases show us that they do not, in fact, respect the judgments that the court has delivered.

<<5309.64;5324.6;en>>
This is also something that we have documented in the articles submitted in our submissions.

<<5324.6;5334.08;en>>
And now, I move to Judge Motoc.

<<5334.08;5342.56;en>>
There are nearly 30,000 Somalis in Norway, and there are 200,000 Muslims in Norway.

<<5342.56;5353.36;en>>
And the government states that it was not possible amongst all this great number to find an adequate foster care family.

<<5353.36;5366.56;en>>
However, there were also no attempts made to find a secular family which would respect the applicants and thus the child's religion.

<<5366.56;5371.08;en>>
This is also replied to the Judge Lemmens question.

<<5371.08;5394.16;en>>
And here, I would also stress that the district court found that the child should be placed in foster care on the 10th of December, 2010, while the child was placed in the foster care home in question on the 13th of December, 2010.

<<5394.16;5415.76;en>>
Thus, I ask the court, is it, has there elapsed enough time in three days to actually make a good and rational thought out decision as to where to place the child in accordance with all the different and difficult questions this case raised?

<<5415.76;5430.68;en>>
Also, in their submissions, the government stated that the Child Welfare Services considered both the applicant's cousin and the two other Muslim foster homes.

<<5430.68;5437.92;en>>
And in this relation, I would point out that this information was not previously known to us.

<<5437.92;5450.6;en>>
This information did not come out during the national proceedings and was only made in, it did not come forth when the chamber reviewed the case.

<<5450.6;5463.32;en>>
It was a submission that was made known to us during the revision done here by the Grand Chamber.

<<5463.32;5474.72;en>>
Furthermore, there are no written reports about the Child Welfare Services contacting two alternative Muslim families.

<<5474.72;5479.6;en>>
And the applicant was never informed about this process.

<<5479.6;5494.92;en>>
She was never asked to submit any opinions regarding the two families, the two Muslim families that the Child Welfare Services say that they considered.

<<5494.92;5507.4;en>>
For that matter, the applicant was never asked to submit her opinion to the fact that the Child Welfare Services wanted to place this particular child in a practicing Christian family.

<<5507.4;5518.64;en>>
And according to the applicant, this information that they were practicing Christian family did not become known to her for some time.

<<5518.64;5525.28;en>>
It was only after some time that the child was placed that this information came forth.

<<5525.28;5529.88;en>>
And this is also replied to the Judge Yudkivska.

<<5529.88;5544.44;en>>
And the last question also from the Judge Yudkivska is how our present case relates to the Telenbaum versus Sweden case.

<<5544.44;5553.2;en>>
In addition to what I've already said regarding the choice of the foster parent, I would like to say the Telenbaum is a case in our favor.

<<5553.2;5564.68;en>>
Because this case, the Telenbaum, demonstrates that the Swedish authorities went to greater lengths to accommodate the families' wishes.

<<5564.68;5574.72;en>>
As I stated previously, they actively involved the biological parents in the choice of the foster family.

<<5574.72;5584.8;en>>
They kept them well informed and wished the biological parents to submit their opinion.

<<5584.8;5604.91;en>>
Also, in the Telenbaum versus Sweden, the Swedish government, the Swedish Child Welfare Services, had gone to a rabbi and asked him to actively participate to try and find a suitable Jewish family within the circles known to this rabbi.

<<5604.91;5637.16;en>>
Also, another point that greatly distinguishes our case from the Telenbaum case is that the biological parents in the Telenbaum case had apparently not found it necessary to take an active part in ensuring that the children's education would be in conformity with their own convictions as they have refused to accept the access offers made by the authorities.

<<5637.16;5649.88;en>>
So, the family did not wish to follow up the visitation contact with the children in order to ensure that their own religious convictions were transformed to the children.

<<5649.88;5656.64;en>>
This is not what is happening in the present case.

<<5656.64;5663.72;en>>
It is well documented that the applicant has at all stages been very keen to have visitation rights with her son.

<<5663.72;5666.4;en>>
She has followed them up in a good manner.

<<5666.4;5672.48;en>>
And she has also proven that the religious aspect of her son's education was very important to her.

<<5672.48;5677.72;en>>
And she has raised the question of religion on numerous occasions.

<<5677.72;5695.36;en>>
But she was rebuffed both by the foster mother who was present during the visitation visits and the Child Welfare Services as they both found the question raised by the applicant as disruptive and bothersome during these visits.

<<5695.36;5699.68;en>>
So, Mr. President, honoured members of the court, these are my answers.

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<5704.1;5707.7;en>>
Thank you very much. And I'll call on Mr. Emberland. You have the floor.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<5710.71;5712.39;en>>
Thank you, Mr President.

<<5715.71;5721.47;en>>
I will respond to the question by Mr. Bårdsen first.

<<5721.47;5731.39;en>>
I understand this as being a question of whether the government understands the seriousness-

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<5731.38;5733.54;en>>
I apologize for interrupting you.

<<5733.54;5736.38;en>>
There seems to be some difficulties with the line.

<<5736.38;5742.28;en>>
It doesn't go through as clearly as it did earlier when you made your first intervention.

<<5742.28;5744.9;en>>
Could you try to speak just for, again, to let us see if any changes have been made?

[[Government;GR1]]

<<5749.42;5751.34;en>>
I can try again.

<<5751.34;5753.58;en>>
I believe some echo here as well.

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<5754.95;5756.75;en>>
I apologize for interrupting you.

<<5756.75;5757.85;en>>
We again have a problem.

<<5757.85;5760.75;en>>
It's as if there is echo on the line.

<<5760.75;5761.85;en>>
Just give me a second.

<<5775.25;5779.75;en>>
I have been asked by the technician to invite you to use the floor.

<<5779.75;5784.05;en>>
So apparently that's part of the technical means that you have available.

<<5784.05;5784.75;en>>
Can you do that, please?

[[Government;GR1]]

<<5787.17;5790.17;en>>
Apologies for that. That was my mistake entirely.

<<5793.45;5801.25;en>>
I will confine my intervention now to responding to the questions of the judges.

<<5801.33;5821.93;en>>
And I start with the question from Mr. Bårdsen, which I take as a question asking whether the government understands the seriousness of the court's scrutiny of child welfare practice in Norway, essentially.

<<5822.61;5857.17;en>>
And let me explain that the reason why the government insists and keeping on insisting that the Strandlobben principles should be reaffirmed is not out of consideration of what the consequences of those views are, but out of consideration that we are afraid that other forces, and I'm referring to individual applicants and third party intervenors, wish to make amendments to the Strandlobben principles.

<<5857.17;5880.73;en>>
So the concern from the government side is that out of consideration of the principle of foreseeability, the government obviously implements the practice of the court and is doing its utmost to do that, but also out of consideration for the rights of the child.

<<5881.57;5896.41;en>>
And naturally we understand that the Strandlobben principles in their application necessarily involves some kind of substantive amendments to be made in domestic practice.

<<5896.41;5903.41;en>>
And this the court, sorry, this the government has stated in the action plan submitted to the committee of ministers.

<<5903.41;5931.85;en>>
This the Supreme Court has said in its judgments and the government is preparing and is implementing several forms of capacity building measures, training, et cetera, to make all efforts to ensure that these principles are followed also in the sense that they have substantive consequences.

<<5931.85;5948.25;en>>
The other question from Judge Bårdsen was, I think, whether it is possible to reach the conclusion in this case that article, that the convention is not violated in the present case.

<<5948.25;5971.33;en>>
And my government believes in all seriousness that yes, that is a possibility if one considers the very broad assessment made by domestic authorities and the very solid evidentiary and research-based material that decisions are based on.

<<5971.33;6006.77;en>>
As to the question from Judge Pastor Vilanova, if I understand correctly, what is the sense of insisting before the court today, the grand chamber, that we can reconsider article eight of the convention having regard to the fact that Norway accepted the judgment on the chamber level?

<<6006.77;6010.85;en>>
And I believe there are two answers to this.

<<6010.85;6024.45;en>>
First of all, the government builds on the assumption that when a case is referred to the grand chamber, there is a renewed consideration of the whole case as such.

<<6024.45;6027.37;en>>
And that is one reason why.

<<6027.37;6041.61;en>>
The other reason is that the questions to the parties that were submitted by the court in July specifically asked whether article eight was violated as well.

<<6041.61;6055.13;en>>
So, this is also one reason why we have considered article eight anew before the grand chamber.

<<6055.13;6089.09;en>>
As to the question by Judge O’Leary, if there is any possible exhaustion problems if we consider this case from the angle of article two or protocol one, for instance, I would say that there might be some exhaustion problems, but that really depends on how the grand chamber approaches article two or protocol one or article nine.

<<6089.09;6119.69;en>>
Because in the government's understanding of the court's practice, the facts of the case will govern whether the facts of the case and the reasoned view of the applicant that have been relied upon in domestic courts will govern the court's possibility to have regard to other provisions regardless of the exhaustion problem.

<<6119.69;6127.77;en>>
So it really comes down to what kind of facts the grand chamber will build its approach on.

<<6127.77;6136.53;en>>
In that respect, I refer to paragraph one, two, five of the government's memorial.

<<6136.53;6169.89;en>>
As to the question by Judge Lemmens, if there is a duty under the convention to avoid particular groups of foster families in a case such as the present, I believe that the correct answer there must be that, of course, the states must have due regard to many aspects of foster parents and the selection of foster parents.

<<6169.89;6181.01;en>>
And this is also reflected in the domestic law provisions that are referred to in the memorial.

<<6181.01;6194.55;en>>
But due regard to all those considerations also have to have regard to the child's needs, and the child's needs will be in the forefront.

<<6194.55;6201.23;en>>
I move to the questions posed by Judge Mortoc.

<<6201.23;6209.57;en>>
We were asked to repeat the attempts that were made to find a Muslim foster home for the boy.

<<6209.57;6215.89;en>>
And this is spelled out in detail in section 2.6 in the government's memorial.

<<6215.89;6232.49;en>>
And just to respond to the applicant's counsel, she stated that these pieces of information about the search for other alternative Muslim foster homes were new to them.

<<6232.49;6242.13;en>>
With all due respect, I think that the applicant's counsel were not present in all domestic proceedings in this case.

<<6242.13;6252.77;en>>
It would be obvious that this has been touched upon in witness statements in the domestic court proceedings at some level.

<<6252.77;6265.47;en>>
And we have tried to assemble all information that we could get about this, and it has been restated in the memorial.

<<6265.47;6272.65;en>>
As to the second question by Judge Mortoc, does the government or did the government try to find a secular foster home?

<<6272.65;6280.57;en>>
And the answer to that is that we have no information that they actually did try to find a secular foster home.

<<6280.57;6302.83;en>>
What the municipality and the child welfare service in the municipality did was to look for an experienced foster home that could, at a very short time, accommodate the extraordinary needs of this particular child.

<<6302.83;6306.45;en>>
They had been trained in being foster parents.

<<6306.45;6310.85;en>>
They had been foster parents before.

<<6310.85;6325.41;en>>
And it will also be shown in the memorial that they had due regard to the boy's religious in these first years of his life.

<<6325.41;6335.45;en>>
They were also in the same city as the applicant in order to make it easier for contact sessions to be implemented.

<<6335.45;6344.85;en>>
And finally, the third question by Judge Mortoc, the relationship between Article 9 and Article 2 or Protocol 1.

<<6344.85;6352.89;en>>
I will just say that this is stated in the government's memorial in Section 5.2.

<<6352.89;6388.33;en>>
And more precisely, if I am permitted, I will just say that in paragraph 131, we state that the principles that thus far have been developed under Article 2 or Protocol 1 are not well suited to address the issues of the present case because, in the government's view, the balancing of interest is primarily directed in the form of educational institutions.

<<6388.33;6393.09;en>>
And a foster home is not an educational institution.

<<6393.09;6401.97;en>>
And the government believes that the practice thus far has been focused on those institutional aspects.

<<6401.97;6406.93;en>>
And for those reasons, Article 9 is to be preferred.

<<6406.93;6407.01;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<6410.72;6414.08;en>>
Thanks to both parties for their answers to the questions.

<<6414.08;6420.08;en>>
I turn to the judges if any judge feels the need to follow up and clarify.

<<6420.08;6426.36;en>>
It does not seem to be the case, meaning that we have now come to the end of this hearing.

<<6426.36;6435.12;en>>
I thank the parties for their submissions and answers to the court's question, and the court will now deliberate on the merits.

<<6435.12;6442.08;en>>
The judgment will be delivered later, and the parties will be informed of the date of the delivery.

<<6442.08;6444.84;en>>
I therefore declare the hearing closed.

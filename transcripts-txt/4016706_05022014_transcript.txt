<<72.84;74.16;en>>
Please be seated.

<<83.84;90.56;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of Sargsyan against Azerbaijan.

<<90.56;101.56;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on the 11th of August, 2006, under Article 34 of the Convention by an Armenian national, Mr. Minas Sargsyan.

<<101.56;114.28;en>>
It was allocated to the first section of the court, pursuant to Rule 52, Paragraph 1 of the Rules of Court, and communicated to the government on the 5th of July, 2007.

<<114.28;125.44;en>>
On the 11th of March, 2010, the chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction in favor of the Grand Chamber, none of the parties having objected to this relinquishment.

[[Applicant;AP3]]

<<233.61;236.72;en>>
Mr. President, this case arises from the armed conflict

<<236.72;238.93;en>>
over Nagorno-Karabakh.

<<238.93;249.53;en>>
The original applicant, Minas Sarkissian, lived with his family in the village of Gulistan, an ethnic Armenian village situated within the territory of Azerbaijan.

<<249.53;257.08;en>>
On 12 and 13 June 1992, the village came under attack by Azerbaijani armed forces.

<<257.08;267.25;en>>
And as a result, Minas and his wife, Lena, and all the other villagers were forcibly expelled and fled into the surrounding forest in fear of their lives.

<<267.25;270.88;en>>
Mr. and Mrs. Sarkissian resettled in Armenia.

<<270.88;279.17;en>>
Minas Sarkissian died in 2009 at the age of 79, and Lena died last month, age 78.

<<279.17;283.05;en>>
This case is continued by their son and daughter.

<<283.05;293.25;en>>
I will respond to the court's first question as to the family's claim under Article 1 of Protocol 1 and Article 8 in relation to their home, land, and other property.

<<293.25;295.4;en>>
Mr. Gasparian will then make submissions

<<295.4;303.21;en>>
about the family's graves under Article 8, as well as responding to the court's second question on Article 13.

<<303.21;305.05;en>>
And then Mr. Gregorian will respond

<<305.05;312.56;en>>
to the court's third question on Article 14 and will make submissions on Article 41.

<<312.56;314.28;en>>
Mr. President, the Sarkissian family

<<314.28;321.44;en>>
were forced to abandon their home, their land, and other property, and they've never been able to return to the village.

<<321.44;336.21;en>>
The denial of their right to return to Gulistan and to have access to and to be able to use and enjoy their property, or to be compensated, amounts to a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1.

<<336.21;342.4;en>>
The government argues that it lacks jurisdiction and has no responsibility for this case.

<<342.4;349.49;en>>
They accept that Gulistan was and remains within its internationally recognized territory.

<<349.49;352.76;en>>
There is therefore a presumption of jurisdiction.

<<352.76;356.44;en>>
This presumption can exceptionally be rebutted.

<<356.44;369.0;en>>
We submit that the government has failed to adduce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of jurisdiction for the period from 15 April 2002 to the present day.

<<369.0;380.4;en>>
Azerbaijan's pleaded position has been inconsistent and unclear, but in 2012, it accepted that Gulistan was not under Armenian control.

<<380.4;383.75;en>>
Its evidence is weak and unreliable.

<<383.75;394.85;en>>
For example, the March 2012 statements of Lieutenant Colonels Abasov and Hossainov have substantial passages which are identical.

<<394.85;411.97;en>>
The intervening government's position is that the village has always been under the full, effective, and overall control of Azerbaijan and relies on detailed eyewitness statements from Nagorno-Karabakh officers attesting to the presence of Azerbaijani military positions in the village.

<<411.97;423.16;en>>
Several statements from former villagers who have tried unsuccessfully to go back to the village confirm that Nagorno-Karabakh forces were not in control of the village.

<<423.16;444.21;en>>
Now, if contrary to our submission, the court were to accept that Azerbaijan lacked control over the village, its responsibility is nevertheless engaged, as a result of its positive obligations under Article 1, to take appropriate steps to ensure respect for the convention rights within its territory.

<<444.21;458.64;en>>
Those obligations remain, even where the exercise of the state's authority is limited in part of its territory, so that it has a duty to take all the appropriate measures which it is within its power to take.

<<458.64;480.0;en>>
Therefore, even in the absence of effective control over Gulistan, the government still has a positive obligation to take diplomatic, economic, judicial, and other measures to secure the applicants' convention rights, as was found to be Moldova's responsibility as regards Transnistria in the Alashku case.

<<480.0;482.28;en>>
And the court applies a high standard.

<<482.28;498.0;en>>
In Alashku, it said that the state must endeavor with all the legal and diplomatic means available to it vis-a-vis foreign states and international organizations to continue to guarantee convention rights.

<<498.0;504.12;en>>
As regards the extent of the government's positive obligations, the present case is different to Alashku.

<<504.12;511.49;en>>
In Alashku, it was established that the Transnistrian regime had de facto control over that territory.

<<511.49;519.12;en>>
In this case, we say that the evidence establishes that no other state or entity has control over the territory.

<<519.12;529.0;en>>
Therefore, the extent of the positive obligations on the government to uphold the convention rights in the territory of Gulistan village are greater than was the case for Moldova in Transnistria.

<<529.0;547.09;en>>
That is because there would otherwise be a vacuum in relation to territory which, since 2002, has undeniably been within the espace juridique of the convention system, a state of affairs that the court in Cyprus and Turkey said must be avoided.

<<547.09;548.93;en>>
Mr. President, it is abundantly clear

<<548.93;559.69;en>>
that the government has done nothing in order to uphold the convention rights of the Sarsians as regards their right to return to their house and land or be compensated.

<<559.69;590.68;en>>
Since 1993, it has been a cornerstone of the international community's efforts in seeking a resolution of the conflict that refugees and displaced persons should be granted the right to return voluntarily or that they be provided with compensation, notably in the Bishkek Protocol itself and through the OSCE Minsk process, as reiterated in the 2005 Basic Principles and the 2007 Madrid Principles and subsequently.

<<590.68;601.64;en>>
The centrality of the right to return has been constantly underlied in UN Security Council resolutions by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament.

<<601.64;613.44;en>>
The international community has also continually made clear its frustration and regret the lack of any tangible, practical developments on this question.

<<613.44;623.16;en>>
This court has bent over backwards to give the government the opportunity to explain what it has done in order to comply with its positive obligations.

<<623.16;651.37;en>>
Even in response to the court's second explicit request on this point, to describe in as much detail as possible the general and individual measures taken since 2002, Azerbaijan's response is merely to submit that it is too dangerous to allow people back into Gulistan and to refer to a 1991 order, which refers to the possibility of private exchanges of property between refugees.

<<651.37;661.49;en>>
As to the restoration of the rights of refugees like the Sarksians, there is nothing else, not one single specific step taken since 2002.

<<661.49;672.69;en>>
Compare that with the series of specific steps taken by Moldova in the Alasku case prior to May 2001 in order to secure the applicants' convention rights.

<<672.69;692.8;en>>
They included interventions by Moldovan politicians condemning the illegality of the applicants' detention, judicial measures taken against those responsible, sending doctors to examine them, and providing financial assistance to their families, and the Minister of Justice negotiating for their release.

<<692.8;713.61;en>>
In the Ivantots judgment, also about Transnistria, Moldova was found to have met its positive obligations by constantly and systematically raising the applicants' particular situation and by continually seeking the assistance of other states and international organizations to secure their release.

<<713.61;734.8;en>>
In this case, the extent of the positive obligations on the state should be assessed in the light of, firstly, international law, notably the Pinheiro Principles, and secondly, specific steps stipulated by the international community in the particular context of this dispute, and thirdly, international practice, as for example in the Dayton process.

<<734.8;739.97;en>>
First and foremost, this means ensuring the right to return and restitution.

<<739.97;744.33;en>>
But it also means ensuring a right to compensation.

<<744.33;750.04;en>>
And there are also many other preparatory steps which should be taken leading to return or compensation.

<<750.04;761.16;en>>
They include establishing a legal regime to verify property ownership, establishing an independent institution to assess and enforce property claims.

<<761.16;775.33;en>>
Other confidence-building measures are set out, for example, in Annex VII to Dayton, and even phased returns in zones which are demilitarized and supported by international peacekeeping force.

<<775.33;786.0;en>>
At no stage in these proceedings has the government ever suggested that it has sought to achieve such aims or anything remotely comparable.

<<786.0;796.02;en>>
The position of Azerbaijan in this case presents a stark contrast to the considerable efforts made by Moldova to reassert the applicants' convention rights in Alaska.

<<796.02;802.92;en>>
We submit that the government's jurisdiction and responsibility is therefore clearly engaged in this case.

<<802.92;805.73;en>>
Mr. President, I turn to the merits.

<<805.73;810.49;en>>
The government has sought to deny that Mr. Sargsyan was the owner of any property in Gulistan,

<<810.49;815.68;en>>
and they do not accept that Minas lived in Gulistan and had his home there.

<<815.68;832.88;en>>
We submit the substantial evidence before the court, including detailed statements from members of the family and other villagers, confirms beyond any doubt that prior to their expulsion, the Sargsyans were living in their home in Gulistan and also establishes Mr. Sargsyan's ownership

<<832.88;834.92;en>>
of his house and land.

<<834.92;839.34;en>>
Minas and Lena physically built the house themselves.

<<839.34;844.32;en>>
They kept livestock, and they grew fruit and vegetables on their land.

<<844.32;850.44;en>>
Contrary to what the government has tried to suggest, Minas Sargsyan was the legal owner of the property.

<<850.44;858.36;en>>
He had applied to the village council in the early 1960s to register the division of his father's land and other property with his brother.

<<858.36;865.16;en>>
This was then recorded in the village council register, and he and his wife built their house on that land.

<<865.16;882.38;en>>
A number of witness statements from villagers, including a member of the board of the village council and a villager who was secretary to the village council for 24 years, confirmed that this was the procedure adopted in the village and that it was the procedure actually followed in Minas Sargsyan's case.

<<882.38;898.16;en>>
The allocation of land plots in the early 60s was regulated by the 1958 Charter on Village Councils, which vested village councils with the power to allot and allocate land within villages and register and record the division of households.

<<898.16;904.18;en>>
The government is simply wrong to suggest that village councils were not empowered to allocate land.

<<904.18;912.28;en>>
The government has repeatedly referred to the 1970 Land Code, which by definition was not in force in the 1960s.

<<912.28;926.52;en>>
As to the 60s, the government simply says that there was an absence of specific laws at that time and that prior to 1970, the only laws regulating property rights were the constitutions of the USSR and of Azerbaijan.

<<926.52;937.52;en>>
To prove his ownership, Minas has produced his technical passport, which incorporates a plan of the house and a specification of his plot of land.

<<937.52;945.25;en>>
The government acknowledges that technical passports were only provided to people who had legal title to the property in question.

<<945.25;956.12;en>>
However, the government tries to suggest that Minas Sargsyan's technical passport was deficient and even alleges that it is a falsification or a forgery.

<<956.12;977.73;en>>
On the contrary, it is perfectly valid in compliance with both the established practice at the time and the relevant domestic law, namely the 1985 instructions, which specified that in rural areas, the basis for registration of homes were the household lists held by the village councils.

<<977.73;987.49;en>>
Furthermore, as Minas had the right to use his land, he automatically became the owner of it in 1991 by virtue of the 1991 Land Code.

<<987.49;997.4;en>>
As the Sargsyans have been denied access to the home and land since 2002, they've effectively lost all control over their property, as well as any possibility to use and enjoy it.

<<997.4;1005.64;en>>
There is no evidence establishing that the Sargsyans' house has been destroyed, as at 15 April 2002 or subsequently.

<<1005.64;1016.21;en>>
Indeed, one villager states that in August 2010, he was able to observe through binoculars that Minas' house was still standing, albeit with a dilapidated roof.

<<1016.21;1019.97;en>>
Minas remains the lawful owner of the house, land, and other property.

<<1019.97;1026.29;en>>
The continuing denial of access is an interference with his rights under Article 1 of Protocol 1.

<<1026.29;1032.12;en>>
And there is no legal basis for such an interference, and certainly not one that is publicly available.

<<1032.12;1039.05;en>>
The government refers to a Ministry of Defense order forbidding access to the village, which is secret.

<<1039.05;1049.49;en>>
There is no justification for the complete negation of the Sargsyans' families' property rights in the form of a total and continuous denial of access without compensation.

<<1049.49;1056.37;en>>
And for the same reasons, Minas and Lena Sargsyans' rights under Article 8 have been and continue to be violated.

<<1056.37;1063.88;en>>
They built their house in the early 1960s, and they lived there for 30 years, before they were forcibly expelled.

<<1063.88;1071.01;en>>
And while he was alive, Minas constantly reiterated his intention to return, as did Lena.

<<1071.01;1073.92;en>>
Mr. President, I now give the floor to Ms. Gasparian.

<<1073.92;1073.92;en>>
Thank you.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<1081.05;1084.65;en>>
Mr. President, I'm going to address the court on Article 8

<<1084.65;1086.21;en>>
and Article 13.

<<1086.21;1093.81;en>>
Firstly, on the applicant's victim status and the merits of his Article 8 claim relating to the grave of the applicant's relatives.

<<1093.81;1112.09;en>>
The applicant submits that the continuing lack of access to his relatives' graves in Gulistan and the failure to respect his positive obligation by adopting measures designed to protect and maintain the graves of relatives in Gulistan, cemeteries engaged the right to respect for his private and family life.

<<1112.09;1120.49;en>>
The court's case law, including Elie Pahouas and Adrie Vionnet, confirm the applicability of Article 8 in comparable situations.

<<1120.49;1122.53;en>>
In Abdullayeva v. Russia, the court

<<1122.53;1130.53;en>>
found a violation of applicant's Article 8 rights as a result of the refusal of the authorities to return her son's body for burial.

<<1130.53;1137.65;en>>
Article 8 was explicitly found to be engaged by the refusal to permit her to visit her son's gravesite.

<<1137.65;1139.97;en>>
In Panola and Forte v. France, the court

<<1139.97;1150.61;en>>
found excessive delay by the authorities in returning the body of the applicant's child following an autopsy of violation of the right to respect for their private and family life.

<<1150.61;1158.01;en>>
Mina Sarksyan's father and three sisters, and Lena Sarksyan's parents and sister are buried in Gulistan cemeteries.

<<1158.01;1172.61;en>>
It is not disputed that the applicants have had no access to Gulistan and the graves of their relatives since they had to flee the village in 1992 and subsequently after the ratification of the convention in 2002.

<<1172.61;1179.65;en>>
The Sarksyans have therefore been unable to visit or take care of their relatives' graves since then.

<<1179.65;1184.17;en>>
The Sarksyans used to regularly visit and take care of their relatives' graves.

<<1184.17;1191.25;en>>
Attending the gravesite and respect and dignity for the deceased were taken very seriously by the Sarksyan family.

<<1191.25;1206.53;en>>
Mina Sarksyan said in 2008, I am a Christian and faithful person and I consider it a sin that I cannot take care of the graves of my ancestors, cannot go and light a candle, visit the graves on Easter, and respect their memory.

<<1206.53;1218.21;en>>
Lena Sarksyan said in 2010, every year on May 2nd, the whole population of the village used to go to the cemeteries as a tribute for respect for the dead.

<<1218.21;1233.21;en>>
We submit that the positive obligation inherent in securing effective respect for the Sarksyans' private and family life require that the government should have taken necessary steps to ensure the protection and maintenance of the Gulistan cemeteries.

<<1233.21;1249.25;en>>
The government has failed to provide any information about any measures it has taken to maintain or safeguard the graveyards, including, for example, protecting them from deterioration caused by vegetation or weathering or acts of vandalism.

<<1249.25;1260.01;en>>
In spite of the court's request in 2007, the government has failed to provide any information whatsoever as to the current status of the cemeteries in Gulistan.

<<1260.01;1266.61;en>>
This has caused the applicants great uncertainty and insecurity as to the fate of the graves.

<<1266.61;1277.69;en>>
The applicants' submissions as to the positive obligation of the government are made in the light of evidence of the damage or destruction of Armenian graves and historic monuments in Azerbaijan.

<<1277.69;1287.73;en>>
For example, in 2004, the European Parliament called on the Azerbaijani authorities to put an end to the demolition of Armenian cemeteries in Nakhichevan.

<<1287.73;1303.85;en>>
We therefore submit that the applicants are directly affected by being prevented from visiting the graves of their relatives in Gulistan, and the government's failure to respect its positive obligations to protect and maintain the Gulistan cemeteries.

<<1303.85;1312.65;en>>
The continuing interference with the applicants' Article 8 rights are not lawful, does not pursue a legitimate end, and is disproportionate.

<<1312.65;1314.77;en>>
Mr. President, I will now address

<<1314.77;1320.29;en>>
the question of domestic remedies and the merits of the applicants' Article 13 claim.

<<1320.29;1339.53;en>>
The burden is on the government to satisfy the court that any purported domestic remedy was effective and available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that it was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicants' complaints, and offered reasonable prospects of success.

<<1339.53;1343.05;en>>
This burden of proof has never been satisfied.

<<1343.05;1345.85;en>>
What evidence does the government rely on?

<<1345.85;1361.53;en>>
There is a brief Ministry of Justice statement assessing that between 1991 and 2006, the courts in Baku delivered judgments in 243 civil claims affecting Armenians, 98 said to be relating to housing disputes.

<<1361.53;1366.37;en>>
However, there are no further details of those cases, except for two.

<<1366.37;1376.57;en>>
The first is the Mamadova case, which concerns the inheritance rights of a US citizen, and the second Chagarian case, which is about the hereditary succession.

<<1376.57;1387.69;en>>
Both cases are quite relevant, not in any way relating to Armenian displaced persons who were expelled and lost their homes and land during the conflict.

<<1387.69;1396.05;en>>
The government has not provided a single example of successful legal claim brought by someone in the Sargsyan's position.

<<1396.05;1412.41;en>>
Then in October 2012, in responding to the applicants' claim for non-pecuniary damages, the government made its first attempt to first reference to a body called the State Committee for Refugee and IDP Issues of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

<<1412.41;1422.01;en>>
It suggests that it would have been possible for the applicant to have applied to this body for support, without specifying what is meant by support.

<<1422.01;1430.17;en>>
There are no details at all as to what powers this body has, or what steps it has actually taken, and for whom.

<<1430.17;1442.57;en>>
Government fails to refer to any specific cases in which the committee has provided support, whatever that may mean, and certainly not to an ethnic Armenian refugee.

<<1442.57;1452.29;en>>
In Akdiva, the court underlined that in applying the domestic remedies rule, realistic account must be taken of the general legal and political context.

<<1452.29;1459.37;en>>
There are no diplomatic relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and ethnic Armenians cannot obtain visas.

<<1459.37;1472.21;en>>
The evidence before the court shows that in practice, visas are only granted to Armenians where they are participating in official visits organized by international organizations or diplomatic missions.

<<1472.21;1477.21;en>>
And in such cases, Armenians have a need to be provided with armed guards.

<<1477.21;1487.17;en>>
Under the Civil Procedural Code of Azerbaijan, the domestic courts have the right to require claimant to attend in person in order to present their evidence.

<<1487.17;1491.77;en>>
And it also requires witnesses to appear before the court in person.

<<1491.77;1496.53;en>>
This would not have been possible in practice for ethnic Armenians.

<<1496.53;1503.83;en>>
Instead of simply asserting there are no property records and alleging that Mr. Saksian's technical passport is forged,

<<1503.83;1506.29;en>>
for the reasons that Mr. Leach has explained,

<<1506.29;1511.69;en>>
there are positive obligations on the government to have someone in Mr. Saksian's position.

<<1511.69;1521.69;en>>
It has jurisdiction over the area, and hence it is responsible for ensuring there is an effective remedy for the applicant to challenge his violated rights.

<<1521.69;1541.77;en>>
The UN binarial principles confirm that the right of refugees to have restored to them any housing, land, or property of which they were unlawfully deprived, or to be compensated for any housing, land, or property that is factually impossible to restore, as determined by the independent impartial tribunal.

<<1541.77;1548.57;en>>
The principles also provide that the right to restitution should be prioritized as to the preferred remedy.

<<1548.57;1571.97;en>>
They also require that the state to establish and support equitable, timely, independent, transparent, and non-discriminatory procedures, institutions, and mechanisms to ensure that everyone unlawfully deprived of their home is able to submit a claim for restitution or compensation to an independent body and to receive a determination.

<<1571.97;1577.25;en>>
Look at the contrast as regards Greek Kipra property claims in northern Cyprus.

<<1577.25;1589.41;en>>
In Demopolis versus Turkey, the Grand Chambers was finally satisfied with the revised provision of the domestic redress on the basis that the property commission had been functioning for four years.

<<1589.41;1591.55;en>>
It was sufficiently independent.

<<1591.55;1601.53;en>>
It had made decisions in significant number of cases, including averting millions of euros in compensation and ordering the restitution of property.

<<1601.53;1607.93;en>>
The commission took a reasonable length of time and was subject to a right of appeal to a high administrative court.

<<1607.93;1614.61;en>>
The Azerbaijani authorities have failed to establish anything remotely comparable to this.

<<1614.61;1622.65;en>>
The government simply says that it is unable to provide alternative housing to the applicants since the applicant is not under its jurisdiction.

<<1622.65;1634.17;en>>
However, the PINARIA principles confirm that the right of restitution of property is a distinct right, which is not prejudiced by the non-return of the refugee possessing property rights.

<<1634.17;1644.25;en>>
Furthermore, states should ensure that restitution claims processing inaccessible for refugees and displaced persons, regardless of their place of residence.

<<1644.25;1658.41;en>>
The government has failed to undertake any measures to reestablish a housing and land registration system, or a property record, or any form of tribunal to receive undetermined property claims from displaced persons.

<<1658.41;1672.13;en>>
Furthermore, the government has not demonstrated that it has introduced a necessary legal regime to create the possibility for someone in the applicant's position to lodge property claims with the courts of Azerbaijan.

<<1672.13;1691.41;en>>
The applicant's second principle submission on domestic remedies is that the rule of exhaustion does not apply in cases where there is an administrative practice amounting to repetition of acts incompatible with the convention and official tolerance by the state authorities, which makes any attempt to bring proceedings futile.

<<1691.41;1701.49;en>>
In summary, it recalled that the original forced expulsion of the Sargsyan family and other ethnic Armenian families were carried out by Azerbaijani armed forces.

<<1701.49;1723.53;en>>
It is clear from the statements made by the international bodies over the years that there is an absence of any political will within the respondent government to ensure the safety of the property of ethnic Armenians, as the international community has been required to censor the continuing hostile anti-Armenian rhetoric of Azerbaijani political leaders.

<<1723.53;1734.73;en>>
We submit that there is strong evidence of the administrative practice, which means that the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies is inapplicable.

<<1734.73;1749.05;en>>
The government has failed to produce any information about appropriate measures it has taken to reduce the general negative climate against Armenians in Azerbaijan after ratifying the convention in 2002.

<<1749.05;1766.09;en>>
In 2006 report, the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance stated that judicial proceedings opened by Armenians trying to secure their rights are set to systematically fail due to the general negative climate against Armenians.

<<1766.09;1776.93;en>>
Any recourse to domestic proceedings in Azerbaijan would have had no prospect of success given the existing discriminatory practice towards Armenians in Azerbaijan.

<<1776.93;1789.17;en>>
For these reasons, we say that there are no domestic remedies that are available, effective, and sufficient, and that the applicant's right to an effective remedy under Article 13 has been violated.

<<1789.17;1792.13;en>>
Mr. President, that concludes my submissions.

<<1792.13;1795.17;en>>
And I am now going to hand over to Mr. Grigoryan to continue.

<<1795.17;1795.29;en>>
Thank you.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<1801.25;1804.41;en>>
Mr. President, I shall make submissions on applicants'

<<1804.41;1812.15;en>>
complaint under Article 14, following by brief submissions on their claim under Article 41.

<<1812.15;1826.37;en>>
The applicants have consistently maintained that they have been the victims of the discriminatory treatment on the basis of their Armenian ethnic origin, in violation of Article 14, taken together with Article 1 of Protocol 1, Article 8.

<<1826.37;1840.09;en>>
As a result of discrimination manifested against the applicants on the ground of their Armenian ethnic origin, they have been firstly restricted from returning to their home and to their relatives' graves since 15 April 2002.

<<1840.09;1845.73;en>>
And secondly, they have never been provided with a remedy to redress their situation.

<<1845.73;1852.09;en>>
And thirdly, they have not been given any material redress for their losses.

<<1852.09;1856.93;en>>
In this case, the clear difference in treatment is a fundamental aspect of it.

<<1856.93;1868.45;en>>
The Sarksan family, as ethnic Armenians, have been and still are treated differently as compared to non-ethnic Armenians within the jurisdiction of the government, who face the same fate as them.

<<1868.45;1873.57;en>>
Who lost their property, had to leave their homes as a result of the conflict.

<<1873.57;1898.01;en>>
The evidence before the court, including the reports of international organizations, such as UNHCR, the Third Parliamentary Assembly Commissioner for Human Rights, and the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance, establishes that the convention violations suffered by the applicant are the result of the government's discriminatory policies and practice.

<<1898.01;1917.33;en>>
The difference in treatment has primarily been manifested in the expulsion of a very large number of ethnic Armenians from their homes on the territory under the control of the government since early 1990s, and the inability of those Armenians to return to their homes or otherwise obtain redress.

<<1917.33;1928.45;en>>
Figures published by ECRI show that about 270,000 ethnic Armenians had left Azerbaijani-controlled territories by 1999 as a result of the conflict.

<<1928.45;1940.53;en>>
There has not been a single example of an ethnic Armenian returning since, or being provided with compensation or alternative means of redress.

<<1943.49;1963.77;en>>
The reports of international organizations, such as Commissioner for Human Rights, ECRI, and UNHCR, show that since 2002, displaced persons living on the territory controlled by Azerbaijan have benefited from governmental assistance of various forms, including housing and other essential services.

<<1963.77;1970.17;en>>
For example, in 2007, more than half a million IDPs received different forms of government's assistance.

<<1970.17;1984.13;en>>
While the steps taken by the government are highly loadable, our point is that this contrasts with zero provision with someone in Mr. Sargsyan's position,

<<1984.13;1989.69;en>>
an ethnic Armenian who's been a victim of the same conflict.

<<1989.69;2003.85;en>>
As to the question whether the government can provide any objective and reasonable justification for such a difference in treatment, whether it pursued a legitimate aim, and whether the means employed were proportionate to that aim, the answer, most emphatically, is no.

<<2003.85;2006.93;en>>
No justification has ever been provided.

<<2006.93;2017.61;en>>
And we submit that there is no evidence whatsoever to establish that the government has taken any measure to combat the ethnic discrimination and racism, which is evident in this case.

<<2017.61;2022.09;en>>
It has clearly failed to comply with its positive obligations under Article 14.

<<2022.09;2023.73;en>>
Mr. President, I now turn briefly

<<2023.73;2027.65;en>>
to the applicants' just satisfaction claim under Article 41.

<<2027.65;2045.13;en>>
The principal aspect of their claim is that, first and foremost, the applicants have sought the restitution of their property, the right to return to the village of Gulistan, and to have access to the control, use, and enjoyment of their home and property, as well as access to the graves of their relatives.

<<2045.13;2046.65;en>>
The written...

<<2046.65;2052.65;en>>
The applicants also seek compensation for their losses, as set out in our written submissions.

<<2052.65;2067.41;en>>
We note that it is quite possible for this court to order restitution and compensation failing restitution, as the court did, for example, in Brumarescu against Romania or in Saganadze against Georgia cases.

<<2067.41;2070.53;en>>
Mr. President, concluding our submissions,

<<2070.53;2083.21;en>>
we would refer also to court's practice under Article 46 of the Convention to refer to the general measures in cases where there are widespread or systemic practices which are incompatible with the Convention.

<<2083.21;2098.29;en>>
For example, in Ananyev against Russia, in applying Article 46, the court took great pains to assess what the causes were of the very poor conditions of remand centres, and also what general measures were required to address them.

<<2098.29;2104.49;en>>
We say that the circumstances of this case would also justify application of Article 46.

<<2104.49;2122.41;en>>
Although it would be a matter for the court as to what specific general measures to stipulate, we recall that in Senide's arrestes against Turkey, the court required the government to introduce a remedy which secured genuinely effective redress for the Convention violations identified.

<<2122.41;2124.81;en>>
Mr. President, that concludes our submissions

<<2124.81;2125.81;en>>
on behalf of the Opposition.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<2127.56;2131.06;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<2131.06;2132.46;en>>
I call Professor Shaw.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<2138.48;2146.08;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court, it is an honor to be before you again.

<<2146.08;2151.28;en>>
I will deal with the Article 1 jurisdictional issue and will make the following points.

<<2151.28;2158.56;en>>
First, that the normal jurisdictional competence of the territorial state may be displaced exceptionally.

<<2158.56;2171.64;en>>
Second, this may happen as a matter of fact, not only with regard to areas under the occupation of other parties, but also with regard to areas, small areas rendered inaccessible by circumstances.

<<2171.64;2185.04;en>>
Thirdly, that the distinguishing feature of this case is that the site of the property claimed is on the line of contact, the ceasefire line, and thus possessed of special features.

<<2185.04;2197.0;en>>
Fourthly, that any positive obligations that Azerbaijan may be deemed to hold in such circumstances under Article 1 are being respected.

<<2197.0;2213.44;en>>
This is not a case like Shiragov in Armenia, which raises fundamental questions as to the jurisdiction and responsibility of the respondent state, which seeks to evade responsibility by the subterfuge of a subordinate local administration.

<<2213.44;2220.98;en>>
This case is concerned with the margins, with the periphery, both in legal and factual terms.

<<2220.98;2223.74;en>>
This also is not Moldova.

<<2223.74;2236.68;en>>
We have here hundreds of thousands of refugees and IDPs from both Azerbaijan and Armenia, not a few dozens.

<<2236.68;2254.34;en>>
This is also not a situation of an Armenian refugee from Baku, an area under Azerbaijan effective control far away from the ceasefire line, a militarily volatile line.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<2255.08;2266.28;en>>
Professor Shaw, the members of your team might come closer to the court if they want to show points on the map. It's quite a distance for us to...

<<2269.88;2281.0;en>>
Not too close, not too close because otherwise my colleagues on the left side will not be able to see it, but maybe a little bit more in the middle. If that is convenient for you, Professor.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<2280.88;2285.56;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I'm obliged.

<<2285.56;2295.08;en>>
We need to get a sense of the area. Our July 2012 topographical map, I can't say which

<<2295.08;2304.96;en>>
one it is. I think it's the, is it that one? Yeah, the one on my extreme right. And figure

<<2304.96;2311.8;en>>
12 of the triple A.S. report commissioned by the court shows clearly that there are

<<2311.8;2328.36;en>>
no Azerbaijani forces in the village of Gulistan, while Armenian forces in the slopes opposite, as they are in the woods, are not shown, as they are impervious to satellite observation.

<<2328.36;2337.24;en>>
The village of Gulistan is one side of a mountainside sloping deeply down to the river. On the other

<<2337.24;2351.28;en>>
side of the river, according to the material presented by the other side on the 18th of October 2013, lie the Armenian forces on a steeply rising slope. This is also shown by

<<2351.28;2359.4;en>>
videos which both sides have shown to the court. The clear, thank you very much, the

<<2359.4;2380.04;en>>
clear consequence of this on Armenia's own documentation is that Gulistan is fully exposed to fire from the military positions of the Armenian forces, who are situated at the very least along the rising slope of the river. I do not go into the question as to whether

<<2380.04;2398.04;en>>
these are NKR, so-called Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh forces, or NKR forces under Republic of Armenia command. We've provided plenty of evidence on this in the Shiragov case. The following

<<2398.04;2400.9;en>>
facts appear clearly from the AAAS.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<2398.99;2407.35;en>>
Professor Shaw, excuse me for interrupting you. I just want to ask the applicants and

<<2407.35;2420.21;en>>
the third party government if they didn't have any objection that those maps were shown now and if they are... they are in the file also but I mean...

[[Applicant;AP3]]

<<2420.24;2430.24;en>>
We don't have objections, we would like to have an opportunity to see them following the hearing and perhaps comment on them, because we couldn't see physically seeing what those maps were today.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<2431.59;2434.19;en>>
Yes, please continue, Professor Shaw.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<2434.5;2441.5;en>>
The following facts appear clearly from the AAAS report commissioned by the court.

<<2441.5;2452.82;en>>
First, Gulistan lies fully and clearly, like all of the surrounding territory, within the internationally recognized sovereign territory of Azerbaijan.

<<2452.82;2458.74;en>>
Secondly, the area under immediate concern is very mountainous.

<<2458.74;2465.22;en>>
Thirdly, the area has been the object of sustained military activity.

<<2465.22;2480.86;en>>
Report notes, and I quote, throughout the period of analysis, 2012, 22 to 2012, evidence of military activity was apparent across much of the region surrounding the village of Gulistan.

<<2480.86;2488.66;en>>
Increases in all categories of military observations were noted in the period from 2005 to 2009.

<<2488.66;2495.22;en>>
And in the period 2009 to 2012.

<<2495.22;2507.78;en>>
Fourthly, as the report puts it, their analysis revealed the near total destruction of the village of Gulistan by 2005.

<<2507.78;2514.06;en>>
It is clear that the area is an active military one and thus dangerous to civilians.

<<2514.06;2516.82;en>>
This is admitted by the other side.

<<2516.82;2524.94;en>>
For example, the commander of the military unit of the NKR Defense Army, Mr. Hamlet Savoyan,

<<2524.94;2546.38;en>>
declared in his evidence provided in Annex 7 of Armenia's submissions July 2012, that while there were roads by which people can get to the village, I do not think, he said, that a civilian or military servant of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic can reach there because that's dangerous.

<<2546.38;2552.38;en>>
A civilian or military serviceman cannot go because there are minefields.

<<2552.38;2556.6;en>>
Also they, Azerbaijani military, will shoot.

<<2556.6;2559.34;en>>
We can't provide the security.

<<2559.34;2572.5;en>>
He continued, they, Azerbaijani forces, cannot guarantee the security of the civilians since the surrounding areas of the village are mined.

<<2572.5;2578.46;en>>
Of course, Azerbaijan does not accept the implication that the threats of shooting come from its side.

<<2578.46;2596.3;en>>
Leaving that aside, officials of the NKR clearly accept that the area is dangerous and inaccessible to civilians and military forces alike due both to the dangers of military confrontation and to the mining of the area.

<<2596.3;2621.02;en>>
The court has been provided with information showing how heavily the area of Gulistan is mined, and the view of the director of Azerbaijan's National Agency for Mine Action, that the village of Gulistan has been defined as an area with extensive mine and unexploded ordnance with no safe access.

<<2621.02;2629.86;en>>
Further there are regular incidents of violent outbreaks of firing across the line of contact, including in the Gulistan area.

<<2629.86;2635.38;en>>
It is an area where fighting erupts from time to time.

<<2635.38;2639.94;en>>
Jurisdiction under Article 1 is primarily territorial.

<<2639.94;2655.78;en>>
One of the exceptions is where a contracting party exercises effective overall control of an area of another state's territory, whether directly or indirectly through a subordinate local administration.

<<2655.78;2667.28;en>>
The normal territorial jurisdiction of a state, therefore, may be displaced where it is unable, as a matter of fact, to exercise control over its territory.

<<2667.28;2680.06;en>>
It is therefore Armenia which bears responsibility under the Convention for the Securing of Convention Rights in the areas of Azerbaijan it directly or indirectly controls.

<<2680.06;2691.38;en>>
The unusual feature in this case, as both Azerbaijan and Armenia agree, is that the village of Gulistan is located right on the line of contact.

<<2691.38;2696.32;en>>
Both Azerbaijani and Armenian maps agree on this.

<<2696.32;2705.58;en>>
There is some evidence from Armenian sources that the village itself was captured by Armenian forces during April 1993.

<<2705.58;2723.62;en>>
Azerbaijani sources state that the Azerbaijani army does not have free access to the village and can only monitor it from outside, and it is covered by Armenian snipers who have a clear view of the village across the river.

<<2723.62;2730.32;en>>
It can, therefore, in no way be concluded that Azerbaijan is in effective control of the village.

<<2730.32;2735.58;en>>
It cannot be responsible under Article 1 in the primary sense of the provision.

<<2735.58;2739.14;en>>
This is not a black hole or legal vacuum.

<<2739.14;2749.38;en>>
It is a very specific and very limited grey line along a ceasefire or militarily volatile line.

<<2749.38;2769.58;en>>
The Court has developed the notion of supplementary or subordinate responsibility with regard to a dispossessed sovereign, and I quote, to take all diplomatic, economic, judicial, or other measures that are in its power to take and in accordance with international law.

<<2769.58;2774.78;en>>
Such obligations, as the Court made clear in Azeri against Serbia, is fact-dependent.

<<2774.78;2778.42;en>>
I make the following points.

<<2778.42;2780.58;en>>
First, the issue is fact- and context-dependent.

<<2780.58;2790.26;en>>
Second, the necessary measures focus on opposition to the continuing occupation of Azerbaijani territories.

<<2790.26;2798.38;en>>
Third, as to the applicant and those in the same position, Azerbaijan has in place relevant mechanisms.

<<2798.38;2809.54;en>>
The Court underlined in Al-Ashqu that a fair balance has to be struck between the general interest and the interests of the individual.

<<2809.54;2818.86;en>>
The obligations must not be interpreted in a way to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden.

<<2818.86;2831.3;en>>
The particular context in this case concerns the situation around the village of Gulistan, which I have explained is right on the ceasefire line and thus highly dangerous.

<<2831.3;2844.3;en>>
Azerbaijan maintains it will be a gross dereliction of duty and a likely violation of Article 2, were it to permit civilians to enter the village.

<<2844.3;2849.94;en>>
The necessary measures have been analyzed by the Court as falling into two parts.

<<2849.94;2860.78;en>>
First, refraining from supporting the regime established by separatist forces, and secondly, seeking to reestablish control.

<<2860.78;2886.7;en>>
The clear, consistent, and continuing opposition of Azerbaijan to the unlawful occupation by Armenia of Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories, and to the separatist regime established as a result of Armenian arms and sustained by substantial aid from Armenia, is a matter of public record.

<<2886.7;2894.66;en>>
Armenia seeks to reestablish its control over its occupied territories by all diplomatic means possible.

<<2894.66;2901.5;en>>
This parallels the requirements laid down by the Court in Ilashko and in Ivantok.

<<2901.5;2911.22;en>>
In our submissions of October 2013, we have summarized the efforts made in this regard concerning the continuing Minsk process.

<<2911.22;2923.46;en>>
Azerbaijan is also committed to the Madrid Principles, one of which is the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence.

<<2923.46;2931.3;en>>
Contrast this with Armenia's policy of planting settlers in the occupied territories.

<<2931.3;2941.26;en>>
Thirdly, with regard to the applicant, Azerbaijan has drawn attention to its order of November 1991, which is still in force.

<<2941.26;2951.94;en>>
This provides a legal framework for the private exchange of properties that were taking place, whereby individual refugees swap their properties.

<<2951.94;2958.42;en>>
By this way, Azerbaijan has sought to deal with a wholly exceptional and emergency situation.

<<2958.42;2963.4;en>>
Beyond this phenomenon, the normal rules of ownership operate.

<<2963.4;2974.1;en>>
This has been described to the Court, and the Court's summation may be found in Sargsyan, the admissibility decision of Paragraph 37 and following.

<<2974.1;2983.34;en>>
As far as the applicant is concerned, it is not known whether he obtained the house of an Azerbaijani refugee in the Armenian occupied areas.

<<2983.34;2986.76;en>>
His own house was not given to a refugee.

<<2986.76;2992.1;en>>
So far as is known, he is engaged in no such exchange transaction.

<<2992.1;3002.84;en>>
To the extent that the applicant maintains that his claimed home in Gulistan was expropriated during the conflict in the early 1990s, he is out of time.

<<3002.84;3005.62;en>>
Such an allegation is in any event denied.

<<3005.62;3010.0;en>>
No claim for compensation has indeed been received.

<<3010.0;3025.5;en>>
It is not possible in the circumstances to resolve the alleged claims of the applicant by specific judicial measures to safeguard his claimed interests, since these have not been under legal attack.

<<3025.5;3034.58;en>>
Only the practical circumstances prevent access to his property.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<3037.75;3038.83;en>>
Thank you, Professor.

<<3039.41;3040.31;en>>
Thank you, Professor Lansky, you have the floor.

[[Government;GR3]]

<<3042.81;3045.41;en>>
Mr. President, esteemed members of the court,

<<3047.97;3052.45;en>>
all what Mr. Professor Shaw explained

<<3053.21;3063.73;en>>
has, of course, direct impact on the right to effective remedies according to Article 13 of the Convention.

<<3066.41;3075.01;en>>
In his current application from 2006, the applicant admits that he has not attempted to exhaust local remedies.

<<3077.49;3089.25;en>>
Indeed, it is possible for ethnic Armenians to claim effectively their property rights other than, different than what the applicants previously declared.

<<3091.13;3095.21;en>>
We deny that there are no effective remedies available for the applicant.

<<3095.21;3101.53;en>>
The Azerbaijani law effectively protects the ownership and the possession of property.

<<3102.77;3116.97;en>>
We do have constitutional regulation and we do have civil court regulation, which sufficiently provides the possibility for indemnization.

<<3117.73;3125.73;en>>
Of course, one could distinguish between legal restitution and legal restitution.

<<3126.37;3129.13;en>>
Remedies and procedures here exist.

<<3130.25;3131.37;en>>
They are not exhausted.

<<3132.09;3145.25;en>>
And the restitution in kind, which in the specific situation in Kurdistan, is not possible because of the complete lack of control of Azerbaijan.

<<3146.05;3158.17;en>>
This does not change the situation that the legal framework for the legal restitution, pecuniary restitution, is existing.

<<3159.29;3181.89;en>>
There are more than 240 civil claims, which have been recorded by the Ministry of Justice between 1991 and 2006, do indeed show, and this is a difference to the situation in Armenia, do indeed show that those are also claims of ethnic Armenians.

<<3183.13;3186.33;en>>
Close to 100 of those are related to housing disputes.

<<3188.25;3210.01;en>>
And of course, we have to say the IDP, those are not cases of IDPs, but they are cases who fit into the situation and they do give remedy also for ethnic Armenians in parallel situations.

<<3210.77;3220.53;en>>
This is why we can conclude that the applicant did not use these existing effective remedies.

<<3221.25;3229.53;en>>
And you may declare, in our opinion, the application admissible also in this stage of the procedure.

<<3229.53;3235.33;en>>
Let's switch to Article 1 of the Protocol No. 1.

<<3237.49;3258.69;en>>
There is no other remedy, no other help than to go into the details of the depositions which you find in our case, and there are indeed a big number of inconsistencies and contradictions contained in the applicant's submissions, which seriously undermine the credibility of the application.

<<3258.69;3261.25;en>>
And the credibility of the applicant's evidence.

<<3264.09;3266.89;en>>
We have to, let me go through those contradictions.

<<3269.01;3280.33;en>>
The main declaration of the applicant alleged, he alleged that his home has been destroyed during the attack on Gulistan in 1992.

<<3280.33;3296.81;en>>
Now, subsequently, the arguments shifted and the arguments tried to develop the position that the house remained standing.

<<3297.77;3305.29;en>>
You can see in the film submitted by the Armenian government in 2012 that all the buildings in the village have been destroyed.

<<3305.29;3317.05;en>>
And you saw and you will see in our map, in this AAA report, that there is indeed a complete destruction of all buildings in Gulistan.

<<3318.17;3330.89;en>>
And if you see, there is, and we carefully studied this map, there is not a single place in which one could see a house which remained standing.

<<3330.89;3342.49;en>>
How could the applicant's cousin in that situation state that he is able to identify the applicant's home with the use of binoculars from the ceasefire line of Nagorno-Karabakh?

<<3342.97;3350.01;en>>
The applicant should explain you today how he could view this house.

<<3350.45;3360.97;en>>
This is an impossible feat and it has to be asked why they changed position into that very, very important piece of evidence.

<<3361.37;3368.37;en>>
And this is why we indeed say that the positions are not reliable.

<<3368.97;3371.37;en>>
There are other contradictions as well.

<<3371.77;3377.37;en>>
The assignment of the plot by the collective farm or by the father of the applicant.

<<3377.69;3382.37;en>>
How many rooms have been in the second floor of this house?

<<3382.69;3384.17;en>>
Three or four?

<<3384.17;3387.05;en>>
And how big was the size of land?

<<3387.65;3391.25;en>>
1,500 square meters or around 800?

<<3392.57;3407.37;en>>
These and other contradictions show all in all that you cannot rely on these depositions and the main substantial basis of the claim is to be denied.

<<3408.57;3418.97;en>>
And other than the applicant tried to tell us there is no reliable title, be it there are no registration records in regard to the property.

<<3419.37;3425.97;en>>
There is no copy of the decision of the village council submitted by the applicant.

<<3426.37;3430.37;en>>
There is no copy of the registry of the village council.

<<3430.77;3439.57;en>>
Indeed, we believe and we are sure that the technical passports which are submitted are forged.

<<3439.57;3450.17;en>>
The regulation which the applicant claims to be applicable indeed is not applicable, cannot be applied in order to prove the property rights.

<<3450.57;3459.57;en>>
And their established practice which they claim to have does not correspond to the established practice of that time.

<<3460.17;3468.57;en>>
The village council never ever had authority to adopt a decision on the allocation of lands adjoining the house at all.

<<3468.57;3482.73;en>>
And the charter of the village council which suddenly appeared by the applicant is in our understanding not existing.

<<3482.93;3487.73;en>>
Despite strenuous efforts, we have been unable to locate this charter.

<<3487.93;3492.93;en>>
Indeed, the newly submitted law relied on by the applicant is unsourced.

<<3492.93;3509.93;en>>
In this context, we do not understand why the applicant has not explained in previous submissions in which he relied on the USSR constitution 1977 and now he seeks to rely on this unsourced law.

<<3510.53;3517.53;en>>
Also, this argument shows that the main reasons of the claim are unfounded.

<<3517.73;3521.53;en>>
The technical passport is deficient, as I said before.

<<3521.53;3523.73;en>>
It does not constitute secondary evidence.

<<3523.93;3535.13;en>>
We have the main argument in our view is the wrong stamp of the Shahumyan district and not of the Goran Boy district.

<<3535.33;3542.93;en>>
You know that the name has been changed and the authorities knew that the district structure has been changed.

<<3542.93;3557.73;en>>
And the passport shows, would have had to show in order to be valid, the technical passport that it should have been issued by the Goran Boy district of the Republic of Azerbaijan, which is not the case.

<<3558.93;3573.33;en>>
And to issue such a technical passport during riots in 1991 in which, as we know, there was a very dangerous situation in the region is also quite incredible.

<<3573.33;3577.33;en>>
Let me switch to Article 8.

<<3577.53;3595.13;en>>
The government is stating again that in the situation of danger, it is impossible to have access to the ceasefire zone and all those arguments developed by Professor Shaw are governing also your analysis concerning Article 8.

<<3595.33;3615.53;en>>
The persisting link with the property concerned, which is necessary for a claim, if a claim of a right to home is done, also hinders the analysis of the violation of Article 8 is given.

<<3615.73;3626.93;en>>
Article 14, we have to refer again that the legal practice shown in Azerbaijan do not show any discriminatory effect.

<<3626.93;3631.93;en>>
Let me come to an end, Mr. President.

<<3632.13;3643.33;en>>
The policy of Azerbaijan in questions of internally displaced persons has been and is always in favor of repatriation of IDPs.

<<3643.53;3649.53;en>>
Azerbaijan does it on the level of the United Nations General Assembly.

<<3649.53;3659.53;en>>
Azerbaijan is encouraging to believe also in the society that all displaced people will be able to return one day to their homes.

<<3659.53;3668.73;en>>
The Armenian society, just the opposite, is encouraged to believe that the return of Azerbaijani people will never ever happen.

<<3668.93;3675.13;en>>
Azerbaijan has never rejected the issue of the return of refugees and the restoration of their rights, including property rights.

<<3675.33;3690.13;en>>
For instance, the two resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly regarding the Georgian conflict, in these resolutions, Azerbaijan voted for the recognition of the right to return of displaced people, while Armenia voted against it.

<<3690.13;3706.53;en>>
And regarding the Madrid Principles, I refer to what has been said by my colleague Professor Shaw, Azerbaijan fully supports one of the basic principles, namely the right of all IDPs and refugees to return to their former places of residence.

<<3706.73;3716.73;en>>
Honorable members of the Court, the present case tackles very serious and important general questions of the application of the Convention.

<<3716.93;3726.13;en>>
It differs in one main thing of all the other cases of the Court with regard to displaced persons in one decisive point.

<<3726.33;3747.53;en>>
This is a case at the line of contact in which there is no access given due to mines and the danger of military attacks, and unfortunately the power of this Court, the human rights, do not work out in a situation of military danger.

<<3747.53;3753.53;en>>
There is no effective remedy and no effective control in such a situation.

<<3753.73;3760.33;en>>
We would love that it is different, but this is the border of human rights protection in such a situation.

<<3760.33;3760.33;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<3762.96;3764.6;en>>
Thank you, Dr. Lansky.

<<3764.6;3767.2;en>>
I give the floor to the government of Armenia.

<<3767.2;3769.2;en>>
I call Mr. Kostanyan.

[[ThirdParty;TP1]]

<<3770.52;3772.24;en>>
Thank you.

<<3772.24;3775.54;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<3775.54;3781.24;en>>
it's an honor to appear before the court on behalf of the government of Republic of Armenia.

<<3781.24;3790.64;en>>
My government was invited to address three questions during the oral pleadings concerning violations of applicant rights under Article I of Protocol No.

<<3790.64;3795.88;en>>
1, Article VIII, 13, and 14 of the convention.

<<3795.88;3813.72;en>>
In addition, in our oral pleadings, we will also address those objections as to jurisdiction and responsibility of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the objections as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, which the court has joined to the merits in its admissibility decision.

<<3813.72;3816.6;en>>
Mr. President, I will start my submission

<<3816.6;3824.0;en>>
with the question on the violation of Article I of Protocol 1 and Article VIII of the convention.

<<3824.0;3831.72;en>>
The government of Armenia fully agree with the applicant that there was a violation of Article I of Protocol 1 and Article VIII.

<<3831.72;3843.36;en>>
The situation on the ground is unchanged since 1992, when the Azeri armed forces attacked the village and forced the ethnic Armenian population to flee.

<<3843.36;3857.76;en>>
As it was previously submitted by the Armenian government, Gyulistan is under the full control of Republic of Azerbaijan, and therefore it falls under the control of Azerbaijan within the meaning of Article I of the convention.

<<3857.76;3879.72;en>>
The evidence provided by the applicant before the court confirms that the applicant lived in Gyulistan with his family in the house owned by him, having in his possession land and other property, the fact which is substantiated by the technical passport, a proper document issued to the applicant.

<<3879.72;3895.28;en>>
The technical passport provides detailed plan of the house and provides specifications about the land and is duly signed and stamped, which mean that respondent arguments in contrary are not substantiated.

<<3895.28;3911.44;en>>
The applicant also produced evidence confirming that the family of Sargsyan made active use their property and land, worked in the village, had deposits in the local banks and earned their income mainly from farming.

<<3911.44;3924.6;en>>
In his decision on admissibility, the court has not disputed the fact that the applicant had no access to his home in Gyulistan since he and his family were forced to flee from the village.

<<3924.6;3941.52;en>>
In addition, I assert that because of this continuing denial of access to his native village, the applicant was unable to take care of his relatives' graveyards and was unaware of the status of those graveyards.

<<3941.52;3950.96;en>>
The government of Armenia recalls its previous submissions about the massive destruction of Armenian graves and historical sites.

<<3950.96;3967.4;en>>
We rely on overwhelming evidence provided by international organizations, such as the European Union, which prove that Armenian historical sites and cemeteries are being damaged, destroyed, and subjected to vandalism in Azerbaijan.

<<3967.4;3974.96;en>>
The most vivid example is destruction of Armenian medieval necropolis of Juha in 2005.

<<3974.96;3984.92;en>>
These acts of vandalism were condemned by the European Union and were referred by different international and regional organizations.

<<3984.92;4002.82;en>>
During the course of examination of this case before the court, the respondent government did not provide any evidence proving that the cemeteries of Gulistan are standing and that the graveyards of the relatives of the applicant are not damaged or vandalized.

<<4002.82;4012.5;en>>
It is therefore still uncertain whether or not the graveyards of the relatives of our applicants are not damaged or destroyed.

<<4012.5;4016.64;en>>
Mr. President, I conclude that the respondent government

<<4016.64;4035.36;en>>
failed to comply with its positive obligation to secure applicants' rights, and continuing the denial of the applicant's return to his home and property or providing redress and restitution violates the applicant's rights under Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol 1.

<<4035.36;4043.0;en>>
I now move on presenting questions concerning the jurisdiction and responsibility of respondent government.

<<4043.0;4081.0;en>>
The government of Armenia and the applicant in their written submissions provide a number of evidence, including a statement taken on 11 August 2010 from the Ankara military officer, which also includes a map of Gulistan with explanations, photos of Gulistan taken from the military points of Ankara, which are located 700 to 1,000 meters from the village of Gulistan, as well as video recording of Gulistan taken by the Ankara army officer and submitted by the government of Armenia.

<<4081.0;4095.7;en>>
Confirms that the gorge through which the river of Inja-Achai is flowing divides the armed forces of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and armed forces of Azerbaijan in the area of Gulistan.

<<4095.7;4105.92;en>>
The village of Gulistan is situated on the north river side of Inja-Achai, which is under the control of armed forces of Azerbaijan.

<<4105.92;4118.46;en>>
If the provided evidence is not enough for the court to reach a decision, it is the Armenian government position that the court should consider a fact-finding mission in the village of Gulistan.

<<4118.46;4133.46;en>>
I invite the respondent government to make an official declaration that they will provide to the court all possible assistance and cooperation in accordance with rule A2 to conduct investigative measures.

<<4133.46;4140.2;en>>
Concerning the Ankara, of course, Armenia cannot guarantee anything on Ankara's behalf.

<<4140.2;4149.64;en>>
However, I would like to submit that Ankara courts for a long time already are directly applying European Convention of Human Rights.

<<4149.64;4163.58;en>>
And as Armenian government has already submitted evidence in Chiragov case, Ankara courts refer to the court case law and base their decision where applicable on the ECHR case law.

<<4163.58;4179.06;en>>
Moreover, I would like to inform the court that despite the fact that Ankara has not yet been recognized as an independent state, its authorities are now in the process of unilaterally ratifying the European Convention of Human Rights.

<<4179.06;4189.64;en>>
And they will officially declare that they are bound by the European Convention like they did years ago with the Geneva Conventions.

<<4189.64;4205.44;en>>
Alternatively, it is my government's position that the court may also invite a specialized impartial organization to conduct a fact-finding mission for the court and collect information the court needs for reaching a decision.

<<4205.44;4214.36;en>>
The court has already done this by inviting geospatial technologies and human rights project to conduct a research for the court.

<<4214.36;4227.32;en>>
This report shed a light on many contradictory submissions of government of Azerbaijan in which the respondent tried to deny the fact of its full control and jurisdiction over Gulistan.

<<4227.32;4235.72;en>>
In this regard, my government also would like to refer to the report produced by geospatial technologies and human rights project.

<<4235.72;4258.8;en>>
I quote, the image analysis enabled detailed documentation of the significant and increasing military presence in the area, including trains, revetments, military buildings, military vehicles, and the presence of vehicles, trucks, and roads through the area in the period of 2005 to 2009.

<<4258.8;4272.72;en>>
This period of military buildup was followed over the period of 2009 to 2012 by continued military development in the region, but of a different type.

<<4272.72;4282.68;en>>
In that, revetments and trenches fell into disuse while military buildings and vehicles presence continued to increase.

<<4282.68;4284.32;en>>
End of quote.

<<4284.32;4297.92;en>>
Moreover, I think it should be decisive for the court that by its letter dated 4 December 2013, the respondent state objected to the disclosure of some images in the report.

<<4297.92;4307.78;en>>
By doing this, the government of Azerbaijan in fact admitted that the military positions, trains, military buildings belong to Azerbaijan.

<<4307.78;4327.16;en>>
I quote, in this context, we have objections to the disclosure of the satellite image provided in figures 6 to 11, 13, and 14, since they indicate precise information as to the military objects of our armed forces of Republic of Azerbaijan.

<<4327.16;4328.86;en>>
End of the quote.

<<4328.86;4331.92;en>>
Mr. President, I would like to stress

<<4331.92;4347.12;en>>
that the government of Armenia did not ask the court not to disclose any part of the mentioned report, since no military objects of the armed forces of Armenia or Ankara are located in the village of Gulistan.

<<4347.12;4356.76;en>>
Even based on the above, it is undoubted that the village of Gulistan is under the full, effective, and overall control of Republic of Azerbaijan.

<<4356.76;4359.8;en>>
Mr. President, I now move to addressing

<<4359.8;4371.64;en>>
the issue of existence of effective remedy, which this court, by its admissibility decision on 14 December 2011, joined to the merits.

<<4371.64;4381.04;en>>
The government of Armenia fully supports the submissions made by the applicant concerning the absence of effective remedies in the meaning of Article 13 of the convention.

<<4381.04;4401.6;en>>
The government of Armenia also submits that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is inapplicable to the present case in the view of existence of an administrative practice in Azerbaijan to prevent the forcibly expelled Armenians, as well as any other person of Armenian origin, from visiting or returning to Azerbaijan.

<<4401.6;4412.72;en>>
Now let me address the last question on violation of Article 14 of the convention, taken into conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol 1 or Article 8 of the convention.

<<4412.72;4434.08;en>>
The government of Armenia insists that the right of the applicant protected under Article 14 of the convention has been violated by the respondent state, as he has been subjected to discrimination on the basis of his ethnic and religious affiliation, in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol 1 and Article 8.

<<4434.08;4449.96;en>>
The question of violation of Article 14, rights of the applicant, should be considered in the context of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, de facto situation which resulted in killings of ethnic Armenians and displaced of hundreds of thousands Armenians from Azerbaijan.

<<4449.96;4464.72;en>>
It is submitted that only ethnic Armenians were subjected to forced displacement from their homes in Azerbaijan, and such a difference of treatment is discriminatory and has no objective and reasonable justification.

<<4464.72;4476.0;en>>
We further state that the applicant is denied his right to return by the government of Azerbaijan and submit that this denial is related to ethnic origin of the applicant.

<<4476.0;4484.64;en>>
Government of Azerbaijan continues applying his discriminatory policy over ethnic Armenians after the ratification of European Convention.

<<4484.64;4493.16;en>>
The government of Azerbaijan, among other barriers, hinders the return of the applicant to his home in Yulistan and enjoying his possessions.

<<4493.16;4516.2;en>>
The most recent appalling evidence of discriminatory policy over Armenians is the pardon, glorification, and the release of Azerbaijani citizen, axe murderer, Ramil Safarov, who was convicted in Budapest for life sentence for killing of Gurgen Markarian, asleep, and attempted murder of another ethnic Armenian officer.

<<4516.2;4527.42;en>>
In 2012, Azerbaijan government acknowledged and endorsed the crimes of Safarov, which was clearly caused by and founded on ethnic hatred towards Armenians.

<<4527.42;4532.88;en>>
This act of the Azerbaijan government was widely criticized by the international community.

<<4532.88;4543.08;en>>
The government of Armenia concludes that the applicant has been subjected to direct discrimination by the respondent government on the grounds of his national origin.

<<4543.08;4554.96;en>>
Therefore, his right guaranteed under Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with the Article 1 of Protocol 1 and Article 8 of the Convention were violated.

<<4554.96;4554.96;en>>
Thank you.

<<4557.84;4560.88;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Kostanyan.

<<4560.88;4563.84;en>>
Questions from the judges? Judge Luis López Guerra.

[[Judge;Luis López Guerra]]

<<4570.48;4576.48;en>>
Thank you. My question is mostly to the representatives of the Azerbaijani government.

<<4576.48;4604.16;en>>
It seems to be from the statement that it's relevant in this case, the context, the geographical context, taking into account that Gulistan or the property of the applicants seems to be in or near the euphemistically called line of contact, maybe should be called front line. Well, apart from all the general disasters

<<4604.16;4623.04;en>>
deriving from a conflict such as the existence of refugees or dispel or spell persons, seems to me that there are specific damages for property, personal or real property, deriving from this situation in the front line or line of contact. Specific damages

<<4623.04;4629.2;en>>
different from general expulsion of persons or displaced persons. Now my question is,

<<4629.92;4655.6;en>>
is there in Azerbaijan some specific normative or regulation concerning this particular and specific damages resulted from direct military action or violent action in the line of contact or the front line? I mean, is there any specific provision in the legal order in this aspect?

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4657.48;4661.4;en>>
Thank you, Judge Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque.

[[Judge;Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque]]

<<4662.53;4664.89;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4664.89;4668.17;en>>
My question is addressed to the applicant.

<<4668.17;4676.09;en>>
The applicant did not address the main argument of the respondent government regarding jurisdiction.

<<4676.09;4690.89;en>>
The respondent government say that they prohibited access of civilians to this particular area because it is dangerous.

<<4690.89;4707.09;en>>
And they gave an order which is secret with that purpose of avoiding civilians in that particularly dangerous area.

<<4707.09;4725.65;en>>
It would be, in their view, unreasonable to request the respondent state to permit access to and circulation of civilians on the line of contact, on the ceasefire line.

<<4728.37;4752.17;en>>
I would like to hear the position of the applicant on this specific argument, having in account Article 57 of the 1977 Geneva Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, which relate to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts.

<<4752.17;4767.61;en>>
And there, you find that there is a legal obligation, an international obligation of states regarding victims of international armed conflicts.

<<4767.61;4780.77;en>>
And specifically, states have the duty to provide for all reasonable precautions to avoid any losses of civilian lives.

<<4780.77;4797.33;en>>
My question is, the legitimacy of this order of the respondent government is, yes or no, grounded on international humanitarian law and the law of war.

<<4797.33;4797.37;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4800.03;4801.27;en>>
Thank you, Judge Gyulumyan.

[[Judge;Alvina Gyulumyan]]

<<4805.71;4806.55;en>>
Thank you, President.

<<4806.55;4810.11;en>>
I have two questions to the respondent government.

<<4810.11;4818.99;en>>
My first question is somehow continues the question which Judge Albuquerque has already put.

<<4820.75;4832.23;en>>
My question is, you stated that it is for the security reasons that applicants didn't allow to return back.

<<4832.23;4836.43;en>>
I know very well the area.

<<4836.43;4851.23;en>>
There are many other villages which are with the same distance from the contact line, which are on the border, but populated by Azeris.

<<4852.23;4860.57;en>>
How is it that you can guarantee the safety of one group of people and not the others?

<<4860.57;4861.95;en>>
This is my first question.

<<4861.95;4874.87;en>>
And my second question concerns your oral submissions about the Armenian government's refusal for the return of refugees.

<<4874.87;4885.27;en>>
You have stated that Azerbaijan voted for the return of refugees in the General Assembly of the United Nations.

<<4885.27;4890.27;en>>
What was the resolution which you have mentioned?

<<4893.55;4904.41;en>>
Did you mean the resolution against which voted also all member states of the Security Council and the states which are in the Minsk Group?

<<4904.41;4909.41;en>>
If it is so, was it the only point in that resolution?

<<4910.69;4914.07;en>>
And Mr. President, I have also one factual question

<<4914.11;4928.35;en>>
concerning the Azerbaijani government's statements about the 20% of their territories which are under the control of the Armenian forces.

<<4928.35;4932.21;en>>
I would like to have more precise figures.

<<4932.21;4934.93;en>>
What is the territory of Azerbaijan?

<<4934.93;4941.47;en>>
And what is the territory which you mean that under the control of the Armenian forces?

<<4941.47;4951.27;en>>
I went to different sources and I found that the territory of Azerbaijan for the moment is 86,600 square kilometers.

<<4954.45;4964.71;en>>
And the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh is 4,388 at the time when it was in the Soviet Union.

<<4964.71;4969.71;en>>
And now it is 11,458.

<<4969.71;4982.71;en>>
I would like to know whether 11,458 square meters is 20% of 86,000 square kilometers.

<<4983.71;4995.83;en>>
This will be my question and I hope I will get answer to my questions unlike in the previous hearing when I didn't get any answer to my questions.

<<4995.83;4995.83;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4999.27;5011.27;en>>
Thank you. May I ask the respondent government to put the three maps on display,

<<5011.27;5026.27;en>>
maybe on the floor in front of the court, to enable the councils for the applicant and the delegation of the Armenian government to have a look at them during the break we will have.

<<5026.27;5031.27;en>>
And we will have a 20-minute break and we will resume at 11 o'clock.

La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5157.49;5161.13;en>>
Please be seated.

<<5161.13;5161.63;en>>
Mr. Leach.

[[Applicant;AP3]]

<<5165.14;5167.3;en>>
Mr. President, thank you.

<<5167.3;5175.22;en>>
The government says that there are no Azerbaijani forces in the village.

<<5175.22;5179.46;en>>
We submit that's not what the evidence shows.

<<5179.46;5192.82;en>>
Firstly, the statement from the Nagorno-Karabakh officer, Major Manukian, in 2010, very clearly says that there are four or five visible military positions and base stations in the village.

<<5192.82;5200.38;en>>
And there are similar statements from other Nagorno-Karabakh officers submitted by the intervening government.

<<5200.38;5211.42;en>>
The satellite report from the American Association for the Advancement of Science also confirms the existence of trenches and revetments in Gulistan village itself.

<<5211.42;5215.1;en>>
And the image that we saw today again confirmed that.

<<5215.1;5218.94;en>>
These are Azerbaijani positions.

<<5218.94;5225.94;en>>
On this point, I also come back to the question of the reliability or otherwise of their evidence.

<<5225.94;5227.34;en>>
And I do think this is important.

<<5227.34;5234.14;en>>
The best evidence that they have come up with in relation to this, I think, is very unreliable.

<<5234.14;5241.58;en>>
I referred to the two statements of Lieutenant Colonel Abasov and Huseynov from 15th of March, 2012.

<<5241.58;5248.62;en>>
If you look again at those, there are large passages of those two statements that are virtually identical.

<<5248.62;5258.94;en>>
If you look at three other statements from military officers taken on the same day, there are two quite critical sentences in those statements that are identical.

<<5258.94;5261.58;en>>
They refer to most of the buildings being destroyed.

<<5261.58;5264.14;en>>
Those sentences are identical.

<<5264.14;5275.82;en>>
The statements you've had from the villagers, also the nearby villagers, they are formulaic statements that deal with the same issues very, very briefly.

<<5275.82;5278.5;en>>
They are not proper witness statements.

<<5278.5;5281.5;en>>
I think there is an issue about the reliability of those evidence.

<<5281.5;5292.3;en>>
I come then to the question, the focus of the government today was on the issue of security and the impossibility of return because of security issues.

<<5292.3;5297.34;en>>
And this is the question that Judge Pinto Albuquerque raised.

<<5297.34;5308.02;en>>
And of course, he's absolutely right to point out that IHL imposes an obligation on the parties to protect the victims of international armed conflicts.

<<5308.02;5311.14;en>>
There's no question about that.

<<5311.14;5326.9;en>>
What we say in response to that is if at a particular point in time it's impossible for security reasons to allow return, well, first of all, there are a whole series of other steps that are and have always been possible.

<<5326.9;5340.34;en>>
The right to compensation, there is no reason why, we've heard nothing again today from the government, why it would not be possible to set up a system to compensate people in the Sargsyan's position.

<<5340.34;5363.94;en>>
There are many, then, particular steps that could and should have been taken that lead to either compensation or indeed return, establishing a proper regime of property ownership, publicizing those details to everyone, establishing independent institutions and mechanisms to assess and enforce property claims.

<<5363.94;5367.06;en>>
Again, we've heard nothing about that from the government.

<<5367.06;5378.66;en>>
As to why that has not been done, why it's not been possible, this court has had similar, has struggled with similar issues in Ex-Inidis, Orestes, and Dimopoulos, as we've mentioned.

<<5378.66;5387.54;en>>
It's also possible that it would have been possible to negotiate staged returns.

<<5387.54;5400.7;en>>
In 20 years of the conflict, 12 years since ratification, we say that the positive obligations also require all those steps, legal, political, diplomatic, judicial.

<<5400.7;5404.3;en>>
And that could include negotiation of staged returns.

<<5404.3;5423.98;en>>
This is dealt with in the conciliation resources report that's in your papers that talks about the example of Dayton, talks about, for example, establishing a zone of separation in a particular region, armies retreating from the zone, creating a demilitarized area under the authority of an international peacekeeping force.

<<5423.98;5430.78;en>>
And that zone becomes the first place where returns take place.

<<5430.78;5442.3;en>>
We've heard nothing from the government on any of this today, again, other than reference to a 1991 order in relation to private exchanges.

<<5442.3;5446.5;en>>
So there's nothing since they ratified the convention in 2002.

<<5446.5;5455.06;en>>
We say it's utterly deficient in relation to its positive obligations.

<<5455.06;5459.56;en>>
We've heard again about domestic remedies from the government.

<<5459.56;5473.3;en>>
We just reiterate briefly that in the seven years this case has been before communicated to the government, they've been able to refer to two specific cases.

<<5473.3;5481.14;en>>
And those two cases are wholly irrelevant to the position of someone in the Sargsyan's situation.

<<5481.14;5484.66;en>>
We heard today about the alleged destruction of houses.

<<5484.66;5488.82;en>>
It was said that there was a reference to his own house being destroyed.

<<5488.82;5492.22;en>>
Well, we've dealt with that in the witness statements very, very clearly.

<<5492.22;5496.98;en>>
His father's house in the village was destroyed in the attack.

<<5496.98;5499.02;en>>
Indeed, his mother died in the attack.

<<5499.02;5501.46;en>>
He tried to go back to rescue her.

<<5501.46;5502.38;en>>
He wasn't able to.

<<5502.38;5506.82;en>>
Minos, his mother, died in a conflagration of his father's house.

<<5506.82;5509.1;en>>
No question about that.

<<5509.1;5518.3;en>>
The statements we've got from other villages confirm some of them, as they were leaving the village at the time, saw that Minos' house was still standing.

<<5518.3;5519.4;en>>
It hadn't been destroyed.

<<5519.4;5521.1;en>>
And there's quite a lot of other evidence.

<<5521.1;5536.14;en>>
The statements from villagers, the photos, sorry, the statements from villagers about the general condition of the village show that there are substantial numbers of buildings still intact.

<<5536.14;5538.9;en>>
The government today talked about complete destruction.

<<5538.9;5541.1;en>>
That's not what the evidence shows.

<<5541.1;5551.54;en>>
The statements from the villagers, the 22 photographs submitted by the Nagorno-Karabakh officer show a number of buildings perfectly intact.

<<5551.54;5562.06;en>>
The satellite report from the American Association for the Advancement of Science says that in 2005, there were 36 properties still intact.

<<5562.06;5565.9;en>>
The map that was shown you today confirms that.

<<5565.9;5569.34;en>>
You can see properties that haven't been destroyed.

<<5569.34;5573.42;en>>
There's no particular evidence about Minos Sargsyan's house.

<<5573.42;5580.78;en>>
And we have the villagers' statement from 2010 saying that he saw the walls standing, had a dilapidated roof.

<<5580.78;5593.94;en>>
If you were to ask Minos and Lena whether they would return to their old house with the walls standing and whether they would repair the roof, the answer, I'm sure, though I can't ask them today, would have been yes.

<<5593.94;5602.02;en>>
In any event, of course, their complaint under Article 1 of Protocol 1, of course, subsists in relation to their land.

<<5602.02;5612.26;en>>
So even if it were established that his property was destroyed and destroyed prior to April 2002, which we say it hasn't been, his claim over land subsists.

<<5615.7;5617.74;en>>
Two final points, Mr. President, if I may.

<<5617.74;5626.38;en>>
There was a reference to the 1958 village charter, which the government say is unsourced.

<<5626.38;5635.14;en>>
Well, you have the original Russian version of the 1958 village charter in your papers.

<<5635.14;5638.02;en>>
My colleague, Mr. Gregorian, obtained it

<<5638.02;5639.54;en>>
in the British Library.

<<5639.54;5643.74;en>>
It is official Soviet publication published in Baku.

<<5643.74;5647.58;en>>
We can give you the reference for the publication.

<<5647.58;5649.78;en>>
I'm not going to do that now, but we can give it to you.

<<5649.78;5651.1;en>>
It's an official document.

<<5651.1;5652.62;en>>
The government say it's unsourced.

<<5652.62;5655.26;en>>
It seems as if they haven't been able to locate it.

<<5655.26;5658.1;en>>
But there's no question about its authenticity.

<<5658.1;5661.42;en>>
Finally, Mr. President, we heard today from the government

<<5661.42;5669.22;en>>
several times about their commitment to the principle to the right to return and to restitution.

<<5669.22;5682.18;en>>
We're encouraged by that, and we think that could encourage this court to order return and restitution, and also to deal with return and restitution in their general measures under Article 46.

<<5682.18;5684.18;en>>
Mr. President, that concludes the submissions

<<5684.18;5685.38;en>>
on behalf of the applicants.

<<5685.38;5685.38;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5686.98;5690.3;en>>
Thank you, Mr. Leach. Who wants to take the floor?

<<5690.3;5691.3;en>>
Yes, please.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<5694.34;5696.9;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<5696.9;5702.74;en>>
I will turn to the comments by the intervening state and the applicants.

<<5702.74;5706.74;en>>
And then my colleagues will reply to the judge's question.

<<5706.74;5720.44;en>>
First, I'd like to touch upon the AAS report and the pictures which we asked the court to take away from the disclosing version of the report.

<<5720.44;5736.1;en>>
We've asked the court to do this because these pictures showed the military positions of Azerbaijani army outside the village, deep inside the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan, even for 12 kilometers.

<<5736.1;5741.46;en>>
And for the military reasons, we did ask the court to do this.

<<5741.46;5751.26;en>>
This topographic map and the picture in the AAS report shows that the military position of the Azerbaijani army are outside the village.

<<5751.26;5759.98;en>>
There is no single place in the AAS report saying that the Azerbaijani army has its position in the village itself.

<<5759.98;5768.22;en>>
Even one trench showed on the figure 12, which is on the left from the village.

<<5768.22;5770.1;en>>
It is not the trench.

<<5770.1;5771.54;en>>
It is bank of the river.

<<5771.54;5774.26;en>>
There is a spring flowing to the Indiachai River.

<<5774.26;5779.1;en>>
And it is shown from the satellite image as a trench.

<<5779.1;5788.7;en>>
There is no reason to place the military trench on such a direction near the village.

<<5788.7;5801.86;en>>
We also submit that the military positions of the Armenian forces are to the southeast of the Indiachai River, which is not covered by the AAS report at all.

<<5801.86;5814.86;en>>
That is why even this image, figure 12, doesn't show the military positions of Armenia because they are situated within the woods, and there is no vision from the satellite.

<<5814.86;5835.86;en>>
As to the intervening government comment concerning that only ethnic Armenians were forced to leave their homes because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, I would like to state that because of this conflict, more than 200,000 Azerbaijanis left their homes from Armenia proper.

<<5835.86;5845.94;en>>
And about 800,000 of Azerbaijanis left their homes from Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding territories of Azerbaijan.

<<5845.94;5853.02;en>>
And the number of refugees from Azerbaijan, Armenian refugees, as far as I know, it's about 300,000.

<<5853.02;5858.06;en>>
I will turn now to Professor Sho to answer the judges' questions.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<5859.57;5862.33;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the court.

<<5862.33;5867.41;en>>
Quick response to some of the questions posed.

<<5867.41;5871.45;en>>
Judge Gulumyan, her questions.

<<5871.45;5881.09;en>>
First of all, the question about Azerbaijani-populated villages in the same position as Gulistan.

<<5881.09;5886.57;en>>
It's important to understand that the line of contact is not one single straight line.

<<5886.57;5890.97;en>>
It is the area between two front-line positions.

<<5890.97;5894.53;en>>
Gulistan is between the two front-line positions.

<<5894.53;5905.89;en>>
This appears clearly from the AAAS report and, indeed, from Armenia's own pleadings.

<<5905.89;5911.49;en>>
I'm instructed to say there is no Azeri-populated village in the same position, i.e.

<<5911.49;5915.85;en>>
between the two front lines.

<<5915.85;5929.81;en>>
Secondly, the territory of Azerbaijan, which has been illegally occupied by Armenian forces, is, we believe, in the region of 16%.

<<5929.81;5934.97;en>>
And we take this from the CIA fact book.

<<5934.97;5939.05;en>>
Full references can be supplied if required.

<<5939.05;5948.41;en>>
Thirdly, since the judge raised this issue, can I apologize for not replying to her questions in Shiragov?

<<5948.41;5959.37;en>>
But as the learned judge well knows, the intervening state was not able to reply in the oral pleadings.

<<5959.37;5967.61;en>>
I turn to a couple of other comments from Mr. Leach.

<<5967.61;5976.41;en>>
First of all, the AAAS report concludes near total destruction of the village by 2005.

<<5976.41;5980.21;en>>
See page 22 to 23.

<<5980.21;5988.45;en>>
It is not true that the evidence shows, independent evidence shows, Azeri forces in the village.

<<5988.45;6001.49;en>>
The AAAS report makes it clear that there are Azerbaijani positions in the area around the village, in various points, not within the village.

<<6001.49;6009.21;en>>
And that's the key point, because the property is situated within the village.

<<6009.21;6027.53;en>>
The rules of international humanitarian law, which he well knows, of course, various returns are possible to areas in positions of conflict.

<<6027.53;6031.33;en>>
But the point about Gulistan village is it's dangerous.

<<6031.33;6032.49;en>>
It is a dangerous spot.

<<6032.49;6040.89;en>>
This is not a question of whether or not an Armenian refugee should be returned to his or her alleged former home in Baku.

<<6040.89;6040.89;en>>
May I pass over now to Dr. Lansky.

[[Government;GR3]]

<<6054.3;6062.54;en>>
Mr. President, esteemed members of the court, we have, as far as we understand, two more

<<6062.54;6064.86;en>>
questions not answered.

<<6064.86;6072.38;en>>
One concerning the resolution which has been quoted by us.

<<6072.38;6088.46;en>>
But Guillaumin was asking if that is the resolution which has been a contrabotum of all the Minsk chair countries and the Security Council members.

<<6088.46;6090.92;en>>
No, it's not this one.

<<6090.92;6112.5;en>>
We have been referring ourselves to the resolution number 66-283, adopted by the General Assembly on 3 July 2012, called Status of Internally Displaced Persons and Refugees from Abkhazia, Georgia, and the Chin Valley region in South Ossetia and Georgia.

<<6112.5;6117.26;en>>
More or less 30 countries voted in favor of this resolution.

<<6117.26;6120.74;en>>
Eight countries voted against it.

<<6120.74;6127.94;en>>
And under others, the United States of America also voted in favor of that resolution.

<<6127.94;6170.5;en>>
Concerning the question of Judge Gera, if there are specific normative regulations for regions like this line of contact, yes, there is, for instance, the presidential decree of August 2001, which orders in its paragraph, in section 3, that the State Committee for Refugees and local authorities are instructed of restoration of 1,400 buildings in two villages of the region.

<<6170.5;6187.82;en>>
And the Minister of Finance is instructed to care for the financial allocations of the repatriation, specific regulation for these regions.

<<6187.82;6214.74;en>>
And the practice of the civil courts in Azerbaijan would fulfill the special needs in cases of IDPs claiming restitution, who are not entitled to enter the country.

<<6214.74;6226.66;en>>
You can be represented in the courts of Azerbaijan, and there is no law which need personal presence if you go and claim in the civil courts in Azerbaijan.

<<6226.66;6226.66;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<6233.35;6240.35;en>>
Thank you very much. We have now come to the end of the hearing. I thank the parties for

<<6240.79;6247.79;en>>
their interventions and answers to the court's questions. The court will now deliberate on

<<6249.67;6256.63;en>>
the merits. The judgment will be delivered later. The parties will be informed of the

<<6256.63;6261.63;en>>
date of delivery. I declare the hearing closed.

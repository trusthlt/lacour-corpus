I declare open the public hearing on the amnesty and merits in the case of Molasali versus Greece.

<<79.77;92.77;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on 5 March 2014 on the Article 34 of the Convention by a Greek national, Ms. Chatitze Molla Sali.

<<92.77;101.41;en>>
The application was allocated to the first section of the court, pursuant to Rule 52, Paragraph 1 of the rules of the court.

[[Government;GR3]]

<<240.83;243.43;en>>
Mr. President, Honourable Members of the Court,

<<243.43;247.97;en>>
the Greek Government have the honour to make the following pleadings.

<<247.97;260.15;en>>
First of all, we are in the position to inform the Court of the Government's initiative to introduce a law reform concerning the optional application of the Sharia.

<<260.15;295.23;en>>
The initiative was taken by the Government within the margin of appreciation in the direction of strengthening the protection of the rights of the members of the Muslim minority in Thrace, mostly of women and children, taking into consideration that some disputes are raised within the minority, questioning the mandatory implementation of the Sharia, so following a change throughout the years of the ethics and the circumstances within the minority.

<<295.23;303.03;en>>
The final provisions of the law will be submitted to your Court as soon as they are adopted by the Parliament.

<<303.03;327.87;en>>
In this context, a reform of the family law, for which your Court raises question number six, as proposed seven years ago by certain law professionals expressing their academic opinion, is not relevant, not being adopted by any Government to be introduced to the Parliament as a draft law.

<<327.87;340.11;en>>
So coming to review the specific application of Molla Salli in concreto, there is not any admission that this case is admissible and valid on its grounds.

<<340.11;358.59;en>>
The principle of legal certainty governing all secessions concluded before the legal reform, affecting the members of the Muslim minority in Thrace and any other beneficiary of property rights, should prevail and should not be compromised.

<<358.59;367.59;en>>
The specific case, we have the opinion, that is not qualified to be examined on its merits by your Court.

<<367.59;370.39;en>>
I shall briefly point out why.

<<370.39;390.99;en>>
Firstly, it is apparent that the applicant presents herself before your Court as being herself the victim of violation of human rights, not in the name of her deceased husband, although her main complaint concerns her husband's right to draft a will.

<<390.99;406.35;en>>
Moreover, all reasoning of national courts in favour or against the applicant never made any reference to her personal status as a woman nor to her religious status as a Muslim.

<<406.35;420.43;en>>
Therefore, issues of violation of Article 6, Paragraph 1, taken either independently or in conjunction with Article 14, may not be admissibly raised.

<<420.43;426.43;en>>
In addition, the applicant's case was heard five times by national courts.

<<426.43;439.13;en>>
The Supreme Court's choice of Sharia in the disputed individual case may not be considered as a manifest error nor as a denial of justice towards the applicant.

<<439.13;450.71;en>>
It is a ruling of an independent and impartial Supreme Court having a specific, detailed reasoning and following a longstanding case law on the matter.

<<450.71;458.95;en>>
Secondly, there is not any admissible basis of violation of Article 1 or the first protocol in this case.

<<458.95;468.51;en>>
National authorities have never upheld in any way whatsoever that the applicant was the exclusive heir of her husband's property.

<<468.51;480.53;en>>
Law-accused decisions overturned by the Supreme Court are obviously not final, without any legal effect, not been possible to be invoked by the applicant.

<<480.53;491.83;en>>
The applicant could have predicted that the ruling of the Supreme Court would not be in her favour, taking into account the applicable rules and the longstanding case.

<<491.83;501.55;en>>
Therefore, the applicant had not even any legitimate expectation to become the exclusive heir of her husband.

<<501.55;517.99;en>>
Coming to the exhaustion of domestic remedies at the time of the introduction of the application, the applicant never denied that she has considered that there were still chances to overturn the critical matter of the validity of the disputed will.

<<517.99;522.55;en>>
This was her main argument before the Turkish restriction.

<<522.55;535.51;en>>
In order to prove the seriousness of such argument, she finally lodged her appeal in Cassation before the Greek Supreme Court, supporting till the end that it was well-founded.

<<535.51;555.11;en>>
So two parallel proceedings, one before your courts and the other before the Greek Supreme Court, were pending at the same time in the same case, seeking for the exact same result, the ruling that the will should have never been annulled.

<<557.85;566.51;en>>
The Supreme Court, before rejecting the applicant's appeal as ill-founded, has reviewed it on its merits.

<<566.51;580.01;en>>
Let me clarify that it was the applicant's first appeal in Cassation, acting for the first time during the whole litigation as a plaintiff and not as a defendant.

<<580.01;592.55;en>>
Following the government's observations of the issue, the applicant argued for the first time, exclusively before your court, that she was obliged to appeal in order to organize her defense.

<<592.55;598.21;en>>
I quote paragraph 10 of the applicant's observation before the first section.

<<598.21;611.03;en>>
In fact, this was against the position of the Turkish First Instance Court, as the applicant admits in paragraph 5 of her observations to the ground chamber.

<<611.03;615.47;en>>
In any case, this argument is irrelevant.

<<615.47;625.39;en>>
On our behalf, we may briefly inform the court of what the litigants of the applicant have recently made known to the government concerning the litigations in Turkey.

<<625.39;648.27;en>>
There was a first litigation, a lawsuit for the annulment of the same Greek will initiated in 2011 against the applicant in Turkey, which was still pending on the grounds raised by the applicant that the annulment of the will is not final in Greece, since her appeal in Cassation was pending before the Greek Supreme Court.

<<648.27;659.19;en>>
The applicant has also evoked a legal opinion of a Greek law professor for such purpose, asking the Turkish courts to appoint experts on the matter.

<<659.19;679.35;en>>
And there was a second litigation initiated by the applicant for the acknowledgment of the will in Turkey, which has been irrevocably rejected in 2014 upon the decision of the Turkish Supreme Court, long before the lodging of the applicant's appeal in Cassation before the Greek Supreme Court.

<<679.35;686.15;en>>
Consequently, there was never any legal obligation to lodge the appeal in Cassation.

<<686.15;706.99;en>>
As the applicant admits, it was her discretional choice and legal strategy to maintain and invoke before the Turkish courts that the litigation in Greece was still pending and that the will was not finally annulled by lodging the appeal in Cassation before the Greek Supreme Court.

<<706.99;730.81;en>>
Shouldn't all jurisdictions, including your courts, treat this case in the same identical manner, namely as a case pending before national courts, despite the fact, or to be precise, exactly because the applicant invokes exhaustion of domestic remedies before your courts and non-exhaustion before national courts?

<<734.25;744.63;en>>
For all the above reasons, we consider that the application does not satisfy the conditions provided in Article 35 of the Convention.

<<744.63;751.39;en>>
Now we come to briefly point out a few crucial matters concerning the merits of the case.

<<751.39;762.99;en>>
Firstly, we would like to observe that the applicant and the intervenors refer to general matters not applicable to the circumstances of this specific case.

<<762.99;780.79;en>>
For example, the argument of differentiation of treatment of women in phrase is not even applicable in this case, with the applicant and all heritage, the sisters of the deceased, are all women.

<<780.79;786.67;en>>
In this case, we do not have a state imposing the mandatory application of the Sharia.

<<786.67;809.91;en>>
We have two women members of the mass minority of race requesting the Greek courts to rule on the application of the Sharia based on their legitimate expectation to become the co-heirs of the brothers as per the longstanding implementation of the Sharia among the members of their family.

<<809.91;821.91;en>>
In fact, if these women had chosen not to dispute the brother's will, the will would be perfectly valid.

<<821.91;835.75;en>>
Besides, even the existence of a choice of the deceased in favor of the civil code and waiving the Sharia is questioned by the circumstances of this case.

<<835.75;839.63;en>>
We have explained our reasons in our observations.

<<839.63;862.31;en>>
One of them is that the deceased chose to marry the applicant solely under the Muslim ritual and not with a civil wedding, an element that, according to the case law of certain lower civil courts, could have waited in favor of the application of the civil code in their family relations.

<<862.31;882.31;en>>
Judgment number 1623 of 2003, the correct number is 1653 of the First Instance Court of Xanthi, for which your court raises question number five, is not final since it is an interim measure's resolution without any legal effect as a res judicata.

<<882.31;886.03;en>>
However, it proves the above argument.

<<886.03;891.73;en>>
Contrary to the case of Mollasalli, there was a civil wedding.

<<891.73;905.03;en>>
For the second case for which your court raises question number five, where the parties have not been married with a civil wedding, the final ruling was that civil courts do not have any jurisdiction.

<<905.03;921.63;en>>
In particular, the judgment of the First Instance Court of Xanthi number 102 of 2012 has been appealed and overturned by the Court of Appeal of Thrace under judgment number 178 of 2011.

<<921.63;924.11;en>>
2015, excuse me.

<<924.11;944.83;en>>
Answering to your court's question number three, the religious marriage of Greek citizens in Greece is perfectly valid with full civil effects as long as a ceremony is held by a former priest of a faith or religion known in Greece pursuant to Article 1367 of the civil code.

<<944.83;962.07;en>>
Coming to the end, we need to emphasize in our case, the husband had any right as long as he lived to duly and validly transfer all his property to the applicant under the Greek property law without any application of the Sharia.

<<962.07;972.59;en>>
In summary, the predictable implementation of Sharia in the case of the applicant did not constitute discriminatory treatment against him.

<<972.59;982.47;en>>
Such an application was based on the law and pursued a prevailing aim of public interest as detailed in our observations.

<<982.47;995.35;en>>
There was also a reasonable relationship of proportionality since the testator could have achieved the duly transfer of his property exclusively to the applicant under other property deeds.

<<995.35;1003.83;en>>
And in any case, the applicant has remained the heir at a percentage of 25% of her husband's property.

<<1003.83;1009.75;en>>
Now, the head of the legal department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will answer to your remaining question.

<<1009.75;1010.01;en>>
Thank you for your attention.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<1021.75;1026.79;en>>
Mr. President, honorable members of the court,

<<1026.79;1042.15;en>>
with respect to questions one and two, I will first address the issue of the extinction of the provisions of the Treaty of Athens and of the Treaty of Sevres relating to the protection of minorities.

<<1042.15;1054.19;en>>
Thereafter, I will turn to the commitments undertaken by Greece and Turkey under the minority clauses of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923.

<<1054.19;1088.07;en>>
The Treaty of Athens between Greece and the Ottoman Empire of 1914 addressed various issues between the two countries, including inter alia in Article 11, questions relating to the status of Muslim and Muslim communities living in the territories which came under Greek sovereignty after the wars of 1912 and 1913 by virtue of international treaties.

<<1088.07;1107.19;en>>
Now, it should be noted that the provisions on minority protection of this treaty, according to the letter of the Article 11, did not apply to the entire Greek territory, but only to those territories ceded to Greece in 1913.

<<1107.19;1120.49;en>>
However, Western Thrace did not form part of Greece at that time, as this region was ceded to Greece in 1923 by virtue of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923.

<<1120.49;1128.55;en>>
Therefore, it is clear that the Treaty of Athens was not applicable to the Muslim inhabitants of Western Thrace.

<<1128.55;1136.15;en>>
Now, this is a position that Greece has always argued on the basis of the following two important arguments.

<<1136.15;1174.63;en>>
First, following the conclusion of the Convention of 30 January 1930, 23, on the compulsory exchange of Greek and Turkish populations and the ensuing transfer of all Muslims established in Greece to Turkey, with the exception of the Muslims of Western Thrace, the minority provisions of the Treaty of Athens, which applied, as was mentioned, in the area ceded to Greece in 1913, became devoid of purpose, and their performance became impossible.

<<1174.63;1199.03;en>>
Indeed, according to Article 62 of the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties, the fundamental change of circumstances is a ground for terminating a treaty, while Article 61 of the Vienna Convention qualifies the supervening impossibility of performance also as a ground for termination.

<<1199.03;1216.23;en>>
These provisions, which can also apply to specific clauses of a treaty, according to Article 44 of the Vienna Convention of Law of Treaties, also codify pre-existing customer international law.

<<1216.23;1218.47;en>>
Mr. President, the reason I'm mentioning

<<1218.47;1229.95;en>>
Article 44 of the Vienna Convention is because the Treaty of Athens also contains provisions relating to territorial adjustments in Greece.

<<1229.95;1238.91;en>>
So as you understand, our argument is that these provisions, this particular provision, remain in force.

<<1238.91;1259.75;en>>
According now to both the above Article 62 and 61 of the Vienna Convention, the minority provisions of the Treaty of Athens are no longer in force since the departure of Muslims from Greek territories where they were applicable made their practical implementation impossible.

<<1262.67;1278.39;en>>
In addition, the abolition in Turkey of the caliphate in 1924 had a direct impact on the entire minority protection system of the Treaty of Athens.

<<1278.39;1296.95;en>>
Second argument, in accordance with Article 59 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the minority provisions of the Treaty of Athens have been abolished by virtue of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923.

<<1296.95;1323.51;en>>
Indeed, Article 37 and the rest of the articles of the Lausanne Treaty provide a comprehensive regime for the protection of minorities, including clauses relating to the settlement of questions relating to the family law or the personal status of their members in accordance with their customs.

<<1323.51;1342.77;en>>
The fact that the Treaty of Lausanne makes no reference to the minority provisions of the Treaty of Athens is a strong indication that these provisions were considered as devoid of purpose and terminated.

<<1342.77;1385.67;en>>
In addition, the ratio of the relevant clauses of the Treaty of Lausanne, which is based on the equal treatment of the members of the minorities with other citizens of Greece or Turkey respectively, was not compatible with that of the minority provisions of the Treaty of Athens, which provided for the autonomy of the Muslim communities in Greece in a manner similar to that of the millet system, which was prevailing in the Ottoman Empire at that time and which disappeared with the dissolution of the empire.

<<1385.67;1399.63;en>>
Furthermore, this autonomous regime was also linked to the institution of the Halifax, which, as was mentioned earlier, was also abolished by Turkey itself.

<<1399.63;1424.35;en>>
To conclude, even if the minority provisions of the Treaty of Athens had survived the compulsory exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey, quod non, the Lausanne Peace Treaty abolished them through the establishment of a totally different regime for the protection of minorities, as will be explained to you in a while.

<<1424.35;1431.59;en>>
Mr. President, as for the Treaty of Sèvres of 1920,

<<1431.59;1441.95;en>>
its provisions, as we know, have been placed, according to its Article 16, under the guarantee of the League of Nations.

<<1441.95;1489.99;en>>
Following the end of the Second World War, the legal validity of the undertakings concerning minorities whose implementation was linked to the League of Nations system was the object of a study in 1950 by the United Nations Secretariat, which, after having taken into account various factors, came to the conclusion, on the basis mainly of the fundamental change of circumstances doctrine, that the former minority protection regime has ceased to exist, with the exception of the Lausanne Treaty of 1923.

<<1489.99;1519.19;en>>
Furthermore, in the addendum to the above study, the UN Secretary General, referring to both the Treaty of Sèvres and the Treaty of Lausanne, stressed, I quote, only in regard to the specific regime established bilaterally between Greece and Turkey under the Treaty of Lausanne, does the Secretariat take the position that Greece and Turkey may still be bound.

<<1519.19;1532.59;en>>
So it is very clear, even from this wording, that the status of the members of the Muslim minority in Thrace is regulated only by the Treaty of Sèvres.

<<1532.59;1548.83;en>>
Regulated only by the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, to the exclusion of the minority provisions, and in particular of Article 11 of the Treaty of Athens, or the provisions of the Treaty of Sèvres.

<<1548.83;1562.63;en>>
In view of the above, I will now touch upon your question on the application of Article 30 of the Vienna Convention on Law of the Treaties, in relation only to the Lausanne Treaty of 1923.

<<1562.63;1585.75;en>>
As was stated already, the Treaty of Lausanne contains provisions relating to the Muslim minority, which are based on the principles of human rights and of equal treatment of minority members with the rest of the population as regards the enjoyment of their civil and political rights.

<<1585.75;1599.79;en>>
Likewise, this treaty guarantees special minority rights, such as educational, linguistic, religious, cultural rights for the members of this minority.

<<1599.79;1615.47;en>>
Hence, the European Convention of Human Rights and the Lausanne Treaty, far from being contradictory or conflicting, are fully consistent, compatible, and mutually reinforcing.

<<1615.47;1631.35;en>>
At this point, I should note that the respondent has not invoked the Lausanne Treaty to justify any derogation or deviation from its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.

<<1631.35;1646.43;en>>
Now, I will turn to the Treaty of Lausanne and the question of whether Greece was obliged to apply the Sharia law in the present case under the minority provision of this treaty.

<<1646.43;1656.95;en>>
First, let me clarify the territorial application of minority protection clauses of the 1923 Lausanne Treaty.

<<1656.95;1692.23;en>>
These provisions, according to the letter of Article 45 of this treaty, applied in respect of Greece only with regard to the only Muslim minority that was exempted from the compulsory exchange of populations pursuant to the 30 January 1923 Convention, which allow me to say that preceded the conclusion of the Lausanne Treaty, August 1923.

<<1692.23;1694.95;en>>
And this is the Muslim minority of Western France.

<<1694.95;1704.47;en>>
That was the only minority that existed on Greek territory at the time of the conclusion of the 1923 Convention.

<<1704.47;1711.35;en>>
So this, I believe, answers also your question regarding the territorial application of the Treaty of Lausanne.

<<1711.35;1734.71;en>>
Likewise, under Article 42 of the Lausanne Treaty, Greece was committed to take in so far as it concerns family law or personal status of the Muslim minority, measures permitting the settlement of these questions in accordance with the customs of this minority.

<<1734.71;1746.47;en>>
It is obvious from the letter of this article that it does not impose any legal obligation on Greece to apply the Sharia law.

<<1746.47;1755.03;en>>
But rather, it allows the settlement of the issues in accordance with the customs of this minority.

<<1755.03;1779.23;en>>
In other words, the Treaty of Lausanne enables and allows Greece to apply the Sharia law in those very specific matters in a manner that the legislator deems most appropriate and consistent with the country's other international obligations.

<<1779.23;1788.55;en>>
Indeed, the above article makes reference to the customs of the Muslim minority and customs, Mr. President, by definition,

<<1788.55;1796.07;en>>
are not static, stable, or invariable, cast in stone.

<<1796.07;1809.71;en>>
But on the contrary, they evolve, they adjust to changing circumstances and societal attitudes, both within the local and the wider minority society.

<<1809.71;1824.51;en>>
Thus, the question, to what extent a religious law should regulate inter alia inheritance law matters, may receive different answers which vary over time.

<<1824.51;1839.03;en>>
It is worth mentioning, however, that in recent years, the number of the Muslim minority members in Thrace who make and register public will has increased.

<<1839.03;1841.87;en>>
And this is something that should be noted.

<<1841.87;1861.75;en>>
As has repeatedly been stressed before the UN treaty bodies, the Greek government takes into consideration the expressed preferences and wishes and the social norms of the majority of the Muslim minority on religious, social, and legal matters.

<<1861.75;1866.31;en>>
Let me say that the new law to which Mrs. Magrippi made

<<1866.31;1874.19;en>>
reference earlier was submitted yesterday, I mean Monday, to the parliament.

<<1874.19;1894.39;en>>
And it proves Greece's continuous efforts to respect the wishes of the Muslim minority in Thrace while preserving the human rights obligations undertaken by Greece and most particularly the European Convention of Human Rights.

<<1894.39;1902.01;en>>
I will now reply to your questions regarding the Jewish community in Greece.

<<1902.01;1903.83;en>>
On this question, I'll be very brief.

<<1903.83;1918.01;en>>
And I would like simply to point out that there is no international obligation in place regarding the Jewish community and its family matters.

<<1918.01;1926.99;en>>
These issues, the family matters and the personal status of the Jewish community are regulated by internal legislation.

<<1926.99;1933.89;en>>
And this legislation has always taken into account the customs of the Jewish community.

<<1933.89;1943.59;en>>
So the status of the Muslim minority in Thrace as regards these specific issues and as was stated above is completely different.

<<1943.59;1959.79;en>>
It's different, and it is governed by the minority provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, which, as I said, does not concern the Jewish community in Greece.

<<1959.79;1963.07;en>>
To conclude, Mr. President, I would

<<1963.07;1977.05;en>>
like to refer again that the only treaty that regulates the status of the Muslim minority in Thrace is the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923.

<<1977.05;1986.87;en>>
And let me say that, once again, that this treaty does not mandate the application of the Sharia law.

<<1986.87;1986.87;en>>
I thank you for your attention.

Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<2007.29;2018.13;en>>
on behalf of the applicant, we would like to thank the court for the chance it has given us to orally present our arguments before the ground chamber.

<<2018.13;2034.33;en>>
My colleague, Professor Tsitsilikis, an ex-student, an ex-lecturer of the law faculty at the University of Reyes in Dermest, the region where the applicant is living, will refer to the substantive issues of the case.

<<2034.33;2049.89;en>>
Myself, ex-student, and currently assistant professor at the same law faculty in Reyes, I will argue that the application satisfies all the admissibility conditions, and I will answer to the court questions.

<<2049.89;2060.97;en>>
We are both delighted to accept the assistance of Denise Mehmet, a Greek lawyer and member of the Muslim minority of Reyes, who is a specialist in Sharia law.

<<2060.97;2065.61;en>>
Indeed, Mr. President, this case presents major particularities.

<<2065.61;2079.35;en>>
While at first glance, it appears to be an inheritance rights case, in its essence, it furthers concerns the right of a member of a Muslim minority not to be subject to Sharia law.

<<2079.35;2091.13;en>>
This is why the applicant would wish to respectively insist on her right to be subject to civil inheritance law, like any other Greek or European citizen.

<<2091.13;2098.29;en>>
At this point, allow me to draw the court's attention to the following two basic remarks.

<<2098.29;2104.57;en>>
Greece is the only European state that applies the Sharia law to its citizens.

<<2104.57;2112.97;en>>
Relevant is the judgment of the ground chamber in the case of Refaq Party versus Turkey of 2003.

<<2112.97;2125.57;en>>
Second remark, Greece is the only European state where the Muftis have competence to adjudicate on certain family and inheritance disputes between Greek Muslims.

<<2125.57;2134.21;en>>
No other European state recognized to Muftis or Orthodox priests or Catholic priests similar judicial competence.

<<2134.21;2141.45;en>>
Relevant to my remark is the judgment of the court in case Pellegrini versus Italy of 2001.

<<2141.45;2150.93;en>>
At first sight, the respondent gives the impression that it aims to safeguard the interests of the Greek Muslim minority.

<<2150.93;2155.37;en>>
And this by referring to several minority treaties.

<<2155.37;2168.57;en>>
On the base of the court case law in Greek cases, my colleague will argue that some of these provisions have no binding force today.

<<2168.57;2180.61;en>>
In any case, we would like to emphasize at this point that the applicant doesn't claim a special legal status or an exemption from the general measures applying to Greece.

<<2180.61;2189.37;en>>
The applicant claims the application of general measures on her behalf in their application of the Greek civil law.

<<2189.37;2195.33;en>>
Then the respondent's argumentation is relevant to the applicant's claims.

<<2195.33;2205.57;en>>
As to the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, the application was introduced before the court on March 2014.

<<2205.57;2221.97;en>>
Some months before, in October 2013, the Greek court of cassation had rejected all the substantive appeal reasons raised by the applicant concerning the compatibility of Sharia inheritance law with the Greek constitution and the convention.

<<2221.97;2239.13;en>>
The judgment was definitive and final in the sense that according to Article 562, paragraph 1 of the Greek civil procedure code, the Greek court of cassation could not come back and re-examine the same appeal reasons.

<<2239.13;2250.21;en>>
Therefore, the applicant's substantive arguments were rejected definitively by the court of cassation in October 2013.

<<2250.21;2256.45;en>>
It is true that the applicant had appealed for a second time before the court of cassation.

<<2256.45;2267.29;en>>
And by its judgment, 556 of 2017, the Greek court of cassation had again rejected the second appeal of the applicant.

<<2267.29;2277.05;en>>
The reason of this second appeal was the relevant objection of the opponent party, the sisters of the testator, before the Turkish court.

<<2277.05;2279.37;en>>
Actually, Mr. President, the proceedings

<<2279.37;2295.33;en>>
before the Istanbul court of first instance have been postponed to January 18, 2018, waiting the court precision about this case, this application.

<<2295.33;2299.73;en>>
My Turkish colleague who is in our team, Mr. Omer Faruk

<<2299.73;2305.09;en>>
Cansat, who is in charge of the proceedings in Turkey, is here with us.

<<2305.09;2312.09;en>>
And following to any relevant question of the members of the court, he will kindly provide any additional information.

<<2312.09;2318.49;en>>
And the relevant hearing is already given to the secretary.

<<2318.49;2338.33;en>>
As to the admissibility condition about the applicant, if applicant is a victim of violation, the will under dispute was declared public by decision of the first instance court of Thrace, of Komotini.

<<2338.33;2346.17;en>>
Following to this decision, a public Greek notary has prepared an inheritance acceptance, which was signed by the applicant.

<<2346.17;2355.05;en>>
The notary act was notified to the Greek tax administration, and the applicant had paid the relevant tax.

<<2355.05;2363.25;en>>
Finally, the applicant registered the inheritance properties before the Greek public deed office.

<<2363.25;2378.93;en>>
Finally, two courts, the first instance court of Komotini and the court of appeal of Thrace before the court of Cassation, had ruled that the dispute public was valid and that the applicant had inherited the properties of the testator.

<<2378.93;2385.93;en>>
In other words, descending inheritance was already accomplished.

<<2385.93;2398.17;en>>
As to the third question of the court, since 1982, Greek marriage can be civil, religious, or both.

<<2398.17;2402.49;en>>
Before this date, all the Greek marriages were only religious.

<<2402.49;2410.01;en>>
Then, when the applicant married the testator, the Greek legal order provided only religious marriage.

<<2410.01;2426.93;en>>
Today, under Article 1,367 of the Greek Civil Code law, weddings celebrated by minister of no religious, including mufti, are assimilated to civil ones.

<<2426.93;2437.07;en>>
Relative to my remark is the paragraph 50 of the judgment of the court in case Serif versus Greece of 1999.

<<2437.07;2453.25;en>>
Nevertheless, the Greek civil courts provide that the Muslim character of the religious marriage, in their marriage before the mufti, is an irrevocable choice of the spouses for the application of the Sharia law on their behalf.

<<2453.25;2470.77;en>>
This is the conclusion of the number 178 of 2015 judgment of the Thrace Court of Appeal, which costs the number 1002 of 2012 judgment of the Xanthe I Eastern Court.

<<2470.77;2476.25;en>>
And these two cases have been referred by the responder.

<<2476.25;2485.25;en>>
The latter, the First Eastern Court, had provided that the Muslim marriage doesn't prejudice the choice of the Sharia law for the family matters.

<<2488.25;2492.81;en>>
Mr. President, as to the fore question of the court,

<<2492.81;2501.29;en>>
according to law 1920 of 1991, Sharia law applies only to Greek Muslims living in Thrace.

<<2501.29;2526.89;en>>
Nevertheless, according to the judgment of the Greek Court of Cassation, number 1723 of 1980, a judgment mentioned in paragraph 23 at Serif case, the Sharia law also applies to Greek Muslims living in Greek regions other than Thrace.

<<2526.89;2535.81;en>>
As to the sixth question of the court, the planned reform is a draft law, is not a law yet.

<<2535.81;2547.85;en>>
The planned reform is not related to the applicant's case because the judgment of the Greek Court of Cassation concerns private dispute.

<<2547.85;2550.57;en>>
And it is a final one.

<<2550.57;2556.57;en>>
Then the government reform cannot redress the violation of African rights.

<<2556.57;2566.29;en>>
Moreover, Greece hasn't yet provide the reopening of civil procedure after a judgment of the court.

<<2566.29;2569.05;en>>
Mr. President, the planned reform

<<2569.05;2573.65;en>>
is contrary to the Greek and European public order.

<<2573.65;2591.01;en>>
The resignation of the Muslim women from her fundamental rights guaranteed by the Greek constitution and the convention in order to submit the case before the Mufti is invalid because it is contrary to public order.

<<2591.01;2598.77;en>>
Relevant is the case Costantin Markin versus Russia of 2012.

<<2598.77;2600.65;en>>
And now, Mr. President, distinguished members

<<2600.65;2600.65;en>>
of the court, I pass the floor to my colleague.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<2604.5;2607.38;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Ktistakis.

<<2607.38;2609.38;en>>
I call Professor Tsitselikis, please, to the floor.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<2611.01;2614.21;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<2614.21;2618.57;en>>
I shall attempt to highlight some aspects of the merits of the present case.

<<2618.57;2628.12;en>>
The three muftis of Greece apply sharia law over cases of family and inheritance disputes in relation to Muslims who are residents of race.

<<2628.12;2638.16;en>>
The law in force of 1991 reiterates the content of the previous law of 1920, but alters the modality of selection of mufti.

<<2638.16;2643.61;en>>
The legal roots of these norms are eventually a series of international instruments.

<<2643.61;2654.77;en>>
The Treaty of Constantinople of 1881, the Convention of Athens of 1913, the Treaty of Sèvres, and the Treaty of Lausanne that came into force together in 1923.

<<2654.77;2659.93;en>>
All of them regulate the personal status of the Muslims according to the customs of the community.

<<2659.93;2667.12;en>>
The Treaty of Athens is the only one to mention explicitly the mufti's jurisdiction organ and sharia as the applicable law.

<<2667.12;2677.97;en>>
This parallel legal order was maintained in Greece also after 1946 when the civil code was universally applicable.

<<2677.97;2698.12;en>>
Answering your question number seven, dealing with the personal status of the Jewish community, it's true that it was repealed by the new civil law in 1946 because of the extermination of the community by the Nazi regime and the lack of a claim from the remaining community to reestablish the Beth Dinn courts.

<<2698.12;2709.01;en>>
On the contrary, the Muslim community and minority enjoyed institutional continuity, including sharia law and mufti's courts, and there was no question to make any change of it.

<<2711.85;2721.41;en>>
They already mentioned international treaties do not provide for a compulsive jurisdiction of the mufti or for the mandatory applicability of sharia law.

<<2721.41;2738.64;en>>
Even if such an interpretation was acceptable in the first half of the 20th century, the new international law on human rights stemming from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the relevant treaties of the UN and the Council of Europe established a new legal order.

<<2738.64;2769.69;en>>
In that new legal environment, the mandatory referral to sharia law by the court of cassation against the wish of the litigant and applicant, by ignoring the universal applicability of the Greek civil law, contradicts the European Convention of Human Rights, Article 6 and 14, the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, Article 14, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Article 1, 2, 15, 16.

<<2769.69;2777.01;en>>
These international obligations are the foundation of the present constitutional Greek legal order on human rights.

<<2777.01;2789.41;en>>
Coming to your question number two, indeed, Article 30 of the Convention of Vienna on application of successive treaties relating to the same subject is of key importance.

<<2789.41;2798.65;en>>
As your court has said, the convention cannot be interpreted in a vacuum, but must be interpreted in harmony with the general principles of international law.

<<2798.65;2813.89;en>>
Account should be taken of any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties, and in particular, the rules concerning the international protection of human rights, Judgment Nada versus Switzerland of 2012.

<<2813.89;2822.77;en>>
Diversion commitments must therefore be harmonized so that they produce effects that are fully in accordance with the convention.

<<2822.77;2827.57;en>>
A pluralistic society demands special treatment for those who have special needs.

<<2827.57;2835.89;en>>
Minority rights are related to minority characteristics, such as language, national belonging, or religion.

<<2835.89;2840.69;en>>
They are not just tolerated, but often need positive action from the state authorities.

<<2840.69;2847.33;en>>
However, the enjoyment of minority rights cannot contravene fundamental human rights.

<<2847.33;2865.25;en>>
In that sense, the Greek law that provides for the move to jurisdiction has to be seen in light to contemporary human rights law, introduced within the Greek legal order as norms of higher hierarchical position, according to Article 28 of the Constitution.

<<2865.25;2868.69;en>>
And this is the meaning of Article 30 of the Vienna Convention.

<<2868.69;2891.41;en>>
Whatever is the legal content of the personal status of the Muslims in Greece, whether there was an exclusive jurisdiction of the mufti, an exclusion of Muslims from the applicability of civil law, or not, the emergence of the new international law of human rights, gradually, after the 50s, draws a hard core of norms that shaped, accordingly, all previous commitments.

<<2891.41;2908.21;en>>
The baseline established by the Greek Constitution and the Convention, and the norms that forbid discrimination on the basis of sex, do not allow, at any ground, implementation of discriminatory measures, especially against the will of the recipient of the rights.

<<2908.21;2930.77;en>>
As the Commissioner for Human Rights, Hammerberg, put it in 2009, any obligation that may arise out of the Treaty of Lausanne, or any other early 20th century treaty, should be viewed and interpreted in full and effective compliance with the subsequent obligation undertaken by the ratification of European international human rights instruments.

<<2930.77;2941.49;en>>
I'm not going to discuss the issue about the Treaty of Athens, because I think we agree with the government, so to save some time of your court.

<<2944.57;2947.45;en>>
But one important remark.

<<2947.45;2967.29;en>>
Moreover, your court has considered that in view of the fundamental importance of the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sex, no waiver of the right not to be subjected to discrimination on such grounds can be accepted, as it would be counter to an important public interest.

<<2967.29;2972.55;en>>
I mention again the judgment Marquine versus Russia, 2007.

<<2972.55;2980.39;en>>
Public interest, thus, emanates from safeguarding of these norms and principles to all, with no discrimination.

<<2980.39;2986.16;en>>
Public interest should aim at preserving legal certainty and legal predictability.

<<2986.16;2995.2;en>>
Notice the respondent argued in their final observation that public interest aims at maintaining a closed legal order for the sake of minority rights protection.

<<2995.2;3007.75;en>>
The ambiguity as for which law was applicable in the present case created, indeed, legal uncertainty, which caused lack of foreseeability and legal predictability.

<<3007.75;3017.64;en>>
Legal certainty is a foundation of rule of law, as your court has said in the case Okiay and others, versus Turkey, judgment of 2005.

<<3017.64;3031.01;en>>
According to the Minister of Education, the expected amendment to the law on muftis aims at the removal of the longstanding uncertainty of law, with reference to the inheritance rights of the Muslims of race.

<<3031.01;3034.05;en>>
The recourse to Sharia cannot be mandatory.

<<3034.05;3042.01;en>>
This is not an issue of academic interest, as the respondent named it, but regards the essence of the legal dispute of the present case.

<<3042.01;3054.33;en>>
The mandatory implementation of Sharia brings severe breaches to the free development of personality and inheritance freedom, and thus infringes both Article 6 and one of the first protocol.

<<3054.33;3064.45;en>>
The discriminatory content of Sharia law, anyway, has triggered in the past 20 years serious concerns of a series of international bodies that propose the abolition of Sharia in Greece.

<<3064.45;3072.53;en>>
Just to mention one, Resolution 1704 by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

<<3072.53;3081.29;en>>
However, if legal pluralism is guaranteed through the personal status of the Muslims of race, as it stands today, one condition should be observed.

<<3081.29;3085.39;en>>
The free will of any Muslim to choose the general legal order.

<<3085.39;3093.2;en>>
The possibility to opt for the civil law is fundamental for the freedom of Muslims to evoke minority rights or not.

<<3093.2;3096.16;en>>
Minority rights are optional, not obligatory.

<<3096.16;3098.41;en>>
Their rights, not obligations.

<<3098.41;3105.85;en>>
By no means, Muslims of race have to be subjected only and exclusively to the minority protection scheme.

<<3105.85;3110.64;en>>
They may choose to attend public schools, not the minority schools, if they want so.

<<3110.64;3113.61;en>>
They may choose civil law, not Sharia law.

<<3113.61;3125.93;en>>
As far as schooling is concerned, the law made clear already in 1977 that Muslim students can attend both public and minority school.

<<3125.93;3133.05;en>>
The proposed amendment to the law on the Muftis makes it clear as far as Sharia law is concerned and vindicates our position.

<<3135.73;3143.55;en>>
The imposition of a certain jurisdiction is at least problematic, especially when the applicable Sharia law is not compatible with the principle of equality.

<<3143.55;3156.69;en>>
As your court said, if a certain juridical system is imposed on the individual on the basis of religious affiliation, it would contradict the general principles and values of the European order and democratic society.

<<3156.69;3160.01;en>>
Refah Partisi versus Turkey, 2003.

<<3160.01;3163.73;en>>
At that point, one question comes up.

<<3163.73;3175.61;en>>
Does the deprivation for a Muslim of race to draft a public will according to the civil law present a lawful strategy to cope with legal pluralism, or does it constitute plain discrimination?

<<3175.61;3183.49;en>>
A lawful approach is to ensure a balance, an accommodation of different social realities in the same legal order.

<<3183.49;3203.12;en>>
The coexistence of different legal systems could be seen as a loadable case of pluralism of law, so long as it ensures everyone a choice to opt for one or the other legal system under one sole condition, that the principle of equality is observed with no exceptions.

<<3203.12;3210.09;en>>
This is a threshold that cannot be trespassed, as it is safeguarded by the public policy.

<<3210.09;3219.77;en>>
This is what was infringed by the Court of Cassation at the present case, as far as Article 6 and 1 of the first protocol is concerned.

<<3219.77;3227.24;en>>
This is what the expected amendment to the Mufti's law is bringing as a remedy.

<<3227.24;3236.12;en>>
And this remedy is in accordance with Article 20 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right of everyone to legal protection by the courts.

<<3236.12;3243.73;en>>
And Article 94, Paragraph 3, stipulating that civil disputes are submitted to the civil courts.

<<3243.73;3253.85;en>>
The judgment of the Court of Cassation bypassed the Greek Constitution and declined to apply the civil law which is applicable to all.

<<3253.85;3259.2;en>>
The applicant was a litigant before the Greek courts, and thus her own rights were infringed.

<<3259.2;3266.09;en>>
Article 6, for a fair trial, is applicable to her, not to the deceased husband.

<<3266.09;3275.97;en>>
The public will, drafted by her Muslim husband, indeed, and gendered legal effects and properties rights to her.

<<3275.97;3278.81;en>>
She is the recipient of rights in accordance with the public will.

<<3278.81;3285.97;en>>
This is why she became subject to a series of norms of civil law that the Court of Cassation denied to apply in her case.

<<3285.97;3295.37;en>>
Therefore, the applicant is herself a victim of violation of Article 6 and 1 of the first protocol because she is a Muslim wife.

<<3295.37;3299.49;en>>
Otherwise, the Sharia law would not have been applicable anyway.

<<3302.2;3318.01;en>>
The Court of Cassation upheld the segregation of Greek civil and Muslim law among citizens who are seen as recipients of a parallel right to a fair trial, attributable according to their religion, between non-Muslims and Muslims.

<<3318.01;3322.81;en>>
This amounts to division between Greek citizens on religious grounds.

<<3322.81;3340.12;en>>
The provision of the applicant to have access to civil court and civil law, as the judgment of the Court of Cassation upholds, amounts to denial of justice, which is arbitrary and brought a radical disturbance to the fair trial character of the proceedings.

<<3340.12;3354.12;en>>
The major reason for this is that there was no law that dictates the mandatory implementation of Sharia law to a Muslim testator, nor does the Treaty of Athens, nor the Treaty of Alsan, stipulate the mandatory implementation of Sharia law.

<<3354.12;3361.24;en>>
In the present case, there was already two court judgments that have said that the will was valid.

<<3361.24;3371.33;en>>
Due to the judgment of the Court of Cassation, the applicant is deprived from a 3 4th of the inherited properties which would belong to her according to the civil law.

<<3371.33;3382.81;en>>
But by two court judgments, the first instance court of commotiny, the court of appeals of thrace, the applicant was seen as the legitimate heir of the properties according to a valid will.

<<3382.81;3399.77;en>>
As my colleague mentioned earlier, the applicant has established real and legitimate expectations to enjoy fully her rights over the properties inherited on the basis of the civil code according to the public will that her husband drafted before he passed away.

<<3399.77;3406.57;en>>
It is important to underline the fact that there is a well-established practice by the notaries of the region.

<<3406.57;3416.69;en>>
They do accept public wills by Muslims, as there is no legal norm or circular by the ministry saying that Muslims cannot draft a public will.

<<3416.69;3426.49;en>>
As an average, every month, more than 50 wills, public wills, are drafted before a notary in Rodopi and Xanthi, another 20 in Evros.

<<3426.49;3435.66;en>>
In total, in the past 20 years, more than 2,600 wills have been drafted, producing legal effects within the Greek legal order.

<<3435.66;3461.12;en>>
According to judgment 25, 2017, so very, very recent, from the first instance court of Rodopi, the scope of the, I quote, the scope of the Treaty of Lausanne was to guarantee the rights of the minority, not to deprive the members of the minority from their civil law rights, according to which a Muslim can draft a public will, as any other Greek citizen.

<<3461.12;3471.65;en>>
The interference to the applicant's right to property should be provided by the law and be proportionate to a legitimate scope in accordance to Article 1, Protocol 1.

<<3471.65;3489.16;en>>
The mandatory failure by the Court of Cassation on the basis of religion to special law, instead of the universal civil law, introduces differentiated treatment as far as the right to ownership is concerned, and therefore constitutes discrimination, according to Article 14.

<<3489.16;3497.25;en>>
In other words, imposing Islamic interstate succession is a disproportionate measure and has no legal basis.

<<3497.25;3502.81;en>>
Introducing discrimination cannot be seen as a legitimate scope either.

<<3502.81;3517.05;en>>
The judgment of the Court of Cassation amended drastically the share of the inheritance to the detriment of the applicant, implementing direct discrimination on the ground of membership to a minority and religion.

<<3517.05;3520.16;en>>
The applicant has been seen as a Muslim woman.

<<3520.16;3524.01;en>>
If she were not a Muslim, the Sharia law would not be applicable.

<<3524.01;3529.41;en>>
If she were not a woman, the inherited lot would be higher.

<<3529.41;3532.25;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court,

<<3532.25;3557.61;en>>
in the present case, the freedom of a Muslim of race to opt for the civil law or not to be deprived from access to civil law, in accordance to the convention and other human rights instruments, is essential for the whole legal and political framework that civic citizenship entails, namely, a global equality of citizens before the law, beyond origin or religion.

<<3557.61;3566.77;en>>
The Court of Cassation does undermine the legitimate expectation of the applicant that fundamental norms of rule of law are universally applicable.

<<3566.77;3576.57;en>>
This is why the applicant's right to fair proceedings and to enjoy the inherited properties have been violated on the basis of discriminatory treatment.

<<3576.57;3587.16;en>>
Last, with regard to justice satisfaction claims, according to Article 41, we refer to the claims presented already in our observations.

<<3587.16;3594.7;en>>
In addition to them, we need to add expenses with regard to the present hearing that we have already submitted to the registry.

<<3594.7;3595.45;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<3596.56;3600.24;en>>
Thank you very much, Professor Tsitselikis.

<<3600.24;3604.04;en>>
And now, thank you to both parties for their submissions.

<<3604.04;3612.88;en>>
And now I invite my colleagues, the judges of the Grand Chamber, to put before the parties the questions they have.

<<3612.88;3612.88;en>>
Judge Sicilianos, please.

[[Judge;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<3617.87;3619.51;fr>>
Merci, M. le Président.

<<3619.71;3624.19;fr>>
C'est une question qui s'adresse principalement au gouvernement.

<<3624.39;3634.95;fr>>
Dans l'arrêt litigieux, la Cour de cassation a affirmé sans plus d'éléments la compatibilité du traité d'Athènes avec la Convention européenne des droits de l'homme.

<<3635.15;3636.31;fr>>
Ma question est la suivante.

<<3636.51;3646.27;fr>>
Est-ce qu'il y a d'autres arrêts dans l'ordre juridique hélénique qui approfondissent cette question de compatibilité entre le traité d'Athènes et la Convention?

<<3646.27;3647.75;fr>>
Merci, M. le Président.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<3648.37;3650.09;fr>>
Merci beaucoup, juge Nußberger.

[[Judge;Angelika Nußberger]]

<<3654.44;3655.24;en>>
Thank you, President.

<<3655.24;3657.16;en>>
I would have three questions.

<<3657.16;3668.58;en>>
The first question, I understand if our applicant had not been a Muslim but a Christian Orthodox, it would be the same situation as long as she is married to a Muslim.

<<3668.58;3670.92;en>>
So a mixed marriage would not make a difference.

<<3670.92;3691.32;en>>
But if you now turn the situation around and the applicant would not be a woman but a man, and she would make a will, and she had also two sisters, so the same situation as we have here but changing the sexes.

<<3691.32;3696.36;en>>
If she then dies, I understand that the will would probably also be invalid.

<<3696.36;3703.68;en>>
But what would then be the exact percentage what the husband would inherit?

<<3703.68;3706.28;en>>
The applicant's lawyer said it would be higher.

<<3706.28;3708.88;en>>
But I would like to know, would it be?

<<3708.88;3710.28;en>>
Now it's one quarter.

<<3710.28;3712.16;en>>
So what exactly would it be?

<<3712.16;3714.04;en>>
How would it be calculated?

<<3714.04;3717.96;en>>
My second question is about the role of the notary public.

<<3717.96;3725.76;en>>
The applicant's lawyer said that there are many wills drafted in front of a notary public in this region.

<<3725.76;3729.56;en>>
So I understand that the notary public is a legal expert.

<<3729.56;3747.12;en>>
So doesn't he have a duty to give advice, to say, to inform about the Court of Cassation's jurisprudence holding wills in this way invalid and warning them that this might be the consequence?

<<3747.12;3760.76;en>>
And could there have been a possibility for designing the inheritance rights in a way that the woman would become 100% heir?

<<3760.76;3770.94;en>>
And my last question is, so we also have the two sisters in the whole family situation.

<<3770.94;3779.68;en>>
So I understand these two sisters had a legitimate expectation to be heirs of their brother.

<<3779.68;3788.0;en>>
So if now the lower court's judgment had become final, what about the legitimate expectation of the sisters?

<<3788.0;3797.84;en>>
Wouldn't that be also sort of an expropriation concerning their legitimate expectation to become heirs of their brother under Sharia law?

<<3797.84;3797.84;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<3798.93;3800.17;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<3800.17;3801.09;en>>
Judge Laffranque, please.

[[Judge;Julia Laffranque]]

<<3802.89;3804.93;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<3804.93;3809.33;en>>
And I thank the parties for their observations.

<<3809.33;3823.03;en>>
There seems to be at least an agreement as far as the international treaties, or in particular the Lausanne Treaty, is concerned that it does not mandate the application of sharia law.

<<3823.03;3837.41;en>>
And also, the Article 43 of the Lausanne Treaty stresses the balance between the respect of minorities on the one hand and the order public on the other hand.

<<3837.41;3848.41;en>>
And my question is related to the legal certainty in this case, and also to a certain extent to the legitimate expectations.

<<3848.41;3860.93;en>>
It's more directed to the government, but of course the applicant is also there to answer if she so wishes.

<<3860.93;3875.25;en>>
The draft law that has been explained by the government and that has been sent very recently to the parliament is there to resolve the uncertainty, as was said also this morning.

<<3875.25;3884.01;en>>
At the same time, the government argues that the applicant should have known that in her case, the sharia law will apply.

<<3884.01;3898.25;en>>
So my question is that the government stresses that there was never a reference made to the applicant's own religion in the reasonings of the judgments.

<<3898.25;3910.25;en>>
However, if I read the judgments, the courts said that it is about succession relations between Muslims, and they have jurisdiction between Muslims, the muftis.

<<3910.25;3922.27;en>>
So this is, for instance, said also at the Court of Appeal of Trusse, the second judgment after the Supreme Court judgment when the case came back to the appealed court in 2015.

<<3922.27;3932.13;en>>
So the government says that the plan reformed is to strengthen the protection of the rights of the members of Muslim minority, and mostly women and children.

<<3932.13;3938.69;en>>
But at the same time, the government says that it is not about the religion or the gender of the applicant.

<<3938.69;3957.25;en>>
So Judge Nußberger has touched upon this, but if the applicant would have been a Greek national of other confession, let's say Greek Orthodox, would then the will of her Muslim husband still be invalid in this case?

<<3957.25;3976.01;en>>
And also, if and to what point if the late husband would have explicitly withdrawn from the Muslim will, as the government also said, what does it actually mean?

<<3976.01;3988.69;en>>
Because it's not known to the court that there exist any expressive verbal stipulations in Greek legislation concerning the withdrawal in beforehand from the Muslim will.

<<3988.69;3998.37;en>>
And are there any case law, is there any case law of the national courts where they have stressed that this is possible, or has this occurred?

<<3998.37;4008.97;en>>
Because the government also says that the husband had any right, as long as he lived, to transfer validly and duly all his property to his wife.

<<4008.97;4018.09;en>>
But that would have meant probably to have a gift, to give a gift to his wife or something else.

<<4018.09;4027.97;en>>
But would have that otherwise also not been covered by the Muslim law if we were taking the jurisprudence of the court of cassation?

<<4027.97;4030.73;en>>
So this is the question.

<<4030.73;4036.13;en>>
As far as the second question is concerned, it is about the legitimate expectation.

<<4036.13;4067.49;en>>
The legitimate expectation on the one hand of the applicant, and on the other hand of the sisters of the deceased husband, and the relation to what I have just asked as a first question concerning the legal certainty and the foreseeability, and concerning the fact that there seems to be not a problem concerning the interpretation of the treaties as such, but interpretation of the treaties by the jurisdictions, by the different jurisdictions.

<<4067.49;4084.01;en>>
The applicant has in its observations in paragraph 27 said that the sisters had already inherited their parents, their deceased parents, according to the succession rules provided by the civil law.

<<4084.01;4095.17;en>>
And my question is then about the legitimate expectations of the sisters, because they already had inherited in one case according to the civil law.

<<4095.17;4104.19;en>>
And what would have been then their expectations, whether in this time it would have been civil law or sharia law that would have been applied?

<<4104.19;4104.69;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4105.65;4108.33;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge Koskelo.

[[Judge;Pauliine Koskelo]]

<<4112.53;4113.33;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4113.33;4119.37;en>>
My question perhaps overlaps to some extent some of the previous questions.

<<4119.37;4138.97;en>>
But I would like to have a clarification from both parties, if possible, regarding the decisive reason why the will was declared invalid.

<<4138.97;4159.33;en>>
I understand from the Court of Cassation's judgment that the Court of Cassation referred to the category of the property in question, that it was held in full ownership or the mulki type of property.

<<4159.33;4166.13;en>>
So was this the reason why the will was declared invalid?

<<4166.13;4172.85;en>>
Or was the reason, did it have to do with who was the beneficiary of the will?

<<4172.85;4185.29;en>>
I think from the applicant's side, we heard that she lost the inheritance because she was a Muslim wife.

<<4185.29;4188.59;en>>
So it is not entirely clear to me what was really the reason.

<<4188.59;4191.25;en>>
Was it the type of property in question?

<<4191.25;4196.37;en>>
Or was it the question, who was the beneficiary?

<<4196.37;4203.81;en>>
What if the beneficiary had been someone else, a third person, not a family member at all?

<<4203.81;4206.81;en>>
Would the will have been valid or invalid?

<<4206.81;4206.85;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4207.76;4211.2;en>>
Thank you very much. Judge Lemmens, please.

[[Judge;Paul Lemmens]]

<<4213.71;4216.19;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4216.19;4221.95;en>>
I have two questions relating to the prohibition of discrimination.

<<4221.95;4227.25;en>>
The first question is addressed specifically to the government.

<<4227.25;4234.11;en>>
The government have replied to the questions by the court in two ways.

<<4234.11;4243.87;en>>
In the first place, they answered with respect to Article 6, taken alone or in combination with Article 14.

<<4243.87;4251.55;en>>
And in the second place, they argued with respect to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

<<4251.55;4256.03;en>>
And the conclusion of the government was that that article is not applicable.

<<4256.03;4261.65;en>>
And I assume that that is the reason why Article 14 did not come into the discussion.

<<4261.65;4269.95;en>>
The applicant, however, has also mentioned Article 14 in combination with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

<<4269.95;4291.11;en>>
My question to the government is, can we assume that the arguments relating to Article 14, relating to Article 6, would also apply to Article 14 in combination with Article 1, Protocol No. 1, if that latter article would be applicable?

<<4291.11;4296.69;en>>
And the second question is one to both parties.

<<4296.69;4310.61;en>>
When we are dealing with discrimination issues, the case law of the court is that a treatment – a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification.

<<4310.61;4324.59;en>>
In other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realized.

<<4324.59;4336.23;en>>
We have heard something about the legitimate aim, but not so much about the reasonable relationship of proportionality.

<<4336.23;4343.53;en>>
Something has been said about it, but I would like to invite the parties to say more how they see this issue of proportionality.

<<4343.53;4343.53;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4344.7;4346.58;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4346.58;4347.58;en>>
Judge Spano, please.

[[Judge;Robert Spano]]

<<4348.29;4361.69;en>>
Just one, there have been many questions, so I want to pose one question, which is related to the question just posed by Judge Lemmens, and it relates to the applicability of Article I of Protocol I.

<<4361.69;4372.65;en>>
The applicants are making a claim of discrimination, so they are inviting the court to apply Article XIV in conjunction with Article I of Protocol I.

<<4372.65;4386.91;en>>
In the pleadings of the parties, both in the applicants' and government's observations, there is a debate on whether there is an adequate recognition at domestic level of any kind of property rights.

<<4386.91;4395.39;en>>
We're talking about the three-fourths which the applicant loses because of the application of Sharia law.

<<4395.39;4400.03;en>>
And there is a debate on whether there was a legitimate expectation.

<<4400.03;4424.21;en>>
May I, however, ask both parties to focus here on a different line of case law, which is in discrimination claims of this sort, we are asking ourselves the court whether but for the condition applied, that is the application of Sharia law, the person in question would have had the benefit afforded to him.

<<4424.21;4450.77;en>>
So I'm asking you not to focus on, if you may, on whether the property right existed or not, which is one line of case law, but the line of case law in discrimination type cases of property rights, where we're asking ourselves whether the mere fact that a condition has been applied in a discriminatory manner and has limited property rights, therefore, Article I of Protocol I is triggered or applicable.

<<4450.77;4459.85;en>>
I want to, if you have time during the interval, to look at a case called Fabris versus France, paragraph 52 of that.

<<4459.85;4465.93;en>>
And I invite you to make a comment on whether that has any bearing on the views of the parties.

<<4465.93;4465.93;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4467.49;4469.97;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4469.97;4472.53;en>>
If there are no more questions...

<<4472.53;4475.45;en>>
Ah yes, Judge Eicke, please.

<<4475.45;4475.45;en>>
Thank you.

[[Judge;Tim Eicke]]

<<4475.49;4478.65;en>>
Sorry, just two short questions.

<<4478.65;4500.14;en>>
One is, we're here, of course, looking at a complaint under the convention in the context of the Lausanne Treaty and possibly the Sèvres Treaty, the provisions of which are primarily addressed to Turkey on its face, and then, of course, applied in reverse to Greece by Article 45 of the Lausanne Treaty.

<<4500.14;4516.18;en>>
And I'd like to understand from the parties whether it is right for this court, and if so, how, to have regard to the impact any of our rulings might have on minorities in Turkey, who, of course, bound by both treaties, too.

<<4516.18;4519.02;en>>
And as I said, if so, how.

<<4519.02;4527.02;en>>
The second question relates to, ties into the question from Judge Sicilianos.

<<4527.02;4538.57;en>>
There is an assertion that the interpretation by the Court of Cassation is consistent with the court's case law, and we've heard about Article 6, Article 1 of the first protocol, and Article 14.

<<4538.57;4566.3;en>>
But I wonder if anybody has given thought to how it is compatible with our case law under Article 9, not forcing the negative right of freedom of religion, which force the right not to practice and reveal one's belief, and the prohibition on states to ask individuals, in this case, the testator, about his or her beliefs and or to force them to follow the tenets of their religion against their choice.

<<4566.3;4568.15;en>>
I wonder if you could address us on that, please, too.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4569.23;4571.71;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4571.71;4589.07;en>>
If there are no more questions, the court will now withdraw, say, until 10 to 11, following which the parties will be able to submit brief observations in reply to each other's submissions and reply to questions from the judges.

<<4589.07;4590.71;en>>
The hearing is suspended.

<<4705.3;4712.34;en>>

<<4712.34;4715.66;en>>
The hearing is resumed and I call Mrs. Pelekou.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<4721.18;4723.18;fr>>
Merci, M. le Président.

<<4723.42;4740.66;fr>>
Mesdames et messieurs les juges, je vais essayer de répondre à la totalité, ou presque, de vos questions en clarifiant et en portant certaines précisions en même temps aux questions soulevées par la partie requérante lors de son intervention.

<<4741.58;4764.46;fr>>
Je vais donc commencer par la question qui semble être la question prédominante et qui a été posée, à notre avis, par plusieurs juges de votre cours, la question de la religion de la requérante et si elle avait été, finalement, un facteur déterminant pour l'issue du procès national qui a été mis en cause entravant les articles, aux articles 6 et 1 du 1er protocole.

<<4764.66;4767.34;fr>>
Eh bien, la réponse, clairement, est non.

<<4767.54;4771.38;fr>>
La religion de la requérante ne fut en aucun cas déterminante.

<<4771.58;4782.58;fr>>
En fait, l'issue du procès national aurait été identique, même si le défunt avait mis sur son testament comme héritier son voisin, un homme de confession non musulmane.

<<4783.1;4797.1;fr>>
Donc, la requérante, concrètement, ne peut pas se prétendre victime de discrimination en raison de sa religion, encore moins de son sexe, en violation des articles 6 et 1.

<<4797.38;4803.3;fr>>
Pour la même raison, et je réponds à la question posée par M. le juge du Royaume-Uni,

<<4803.98;4810.02;fr>>
il n'est pas question de violation de l'article 9 dans l'affaire sous examen, devant vous.

<<4811.46;4833.66;fr>>
Concernant la 2e question de Mme la juge Nüberger, si je prononce correctement votre nom, concernant les notaires, oui, les notaires ont une obligation d'informer les partis qui se présentent devant eux pour rédiger un acte notaire de leurs droits et des éventuels risques qu'ils encourt.

<<4833.9;4837.14;fr>>
Et ceci n'a pas été fait, tout évidemment, en l'occurrence.

<<4837.7;4872.38;fr>>
Concernant la question des sœurs du défunt, des belles-sœurs de la requérante, et de leur attente légitime d'acquérir également des droits patrimoniaux, la réponse est que, bien évidemment, elles avaient initialement une espérance légitime en raison de l'application depuis longtemps de leurs règles coutumières, qui, par la suite, est devenue un droit bien établi, selon la jurisprudence nationale, car il a été reconnu par un arrêt de la Cour suprême, de la Cour de cassation, irrévocable.

<<4873.34;4902.18;fr>>
Concernant la deuxième question du juge au titre d'Alpany, concernant la réforme qui est sous adoption, et comment va-t-elle renforcer, généralement, les droits des membres de la minorité, il faut préciser que cette réforme a une envergure bien plus large que les questions posées par rapport à la requérante dans l'affaire sous examen.

<<4902.38;4923.42;fr>>
Donc, cette réforme vise à toutes les relations familiales, ainsi qu'aux relations de succession, de sorte à ce que les personnes qui choisirent pour disposer de leur fortune par testament après la mort puissent exercer ce droit sans aucune contestation.

<<4923.62;4934.54;fr>>
Donc, on n'est pas dans le cas de la requérante ici, parce que ce n'est pas son propre droit à tel qui a été de rédiger un testament, qui a été atteint.

<<4934.74;4948.54;fr>>
J'avance avec la question posée par la Finlande, par Mme la juge au titre de Finlande, si la catégorie de la propriété léguée était importante.

<<4948.54;4962.58;fr>>
On l'a déjà dit, oui, en combinaison avec le fait que la partie de Mandresse, donc les sœurs du défunt, ainsi que ce dernier, était membre d'une minorité de caractère religieux.

<<4963.62;4974.62;fr>>
Pour renverser un petit peu l'argument, c'est que si la propriété n'était pas des mulques, mais c'était de la forêt, par exemple, personne n'aurait droit à léguer cette propriété.

<<4974.62;5002.38;fr>>
Je viens sur la question de l'éventuelle entrave à l'ordre public qui a été soulevée par la partie requérante en raison de la religion et du sexe de la requérante, qui n'est pas posée, qui n'est vraiment pas posée dans cette affaire, parce que, comme on l'a dit, ce n'étaient pas ces deux facteurs qui ont joué un certain rôle.

<<5002.38;5010.42;fr>>
Et je vais terminer par la question de proportionnalité, qui a été également posée.

<<5010.62;5020.7;fr>>
Pour nous, cette proportionnalité a été réservée car le but visé, c'était le transfert total de la propriété léguée à la requérante.

<<5020.9;5040.62;fr>>
Ce but aurait été très bien préservé si le défunt avait transféré sa propriété en vie à son épouse, et cela, il pouvait le faire indépendamment de sa qualité de membre de la minorité musulmane.

<<5040.78;5044.1;fr>>
Je termine avec l'article 41.

<<5044.38;5052.34;fr>>
Le gouvernement observe que les demandes de la requérante n'ont pas été reprises devant votre Chambre lors de la procédure écrite.

<<5052.5;5060.66;fr>>
Toutefois, il se refait que la rémunération de la rémunération de la rémunération dans ses observations écrites.

<<5060.82;5070.02;fr>>
Il clarifie tout autant que l'acte notaire enregistré par la requérante faisait référence uniquement aux propriétés léguées en Grèce.

<<5070.18;5076.54;fr>>
Donc, ce sont que ces propriétés qui ont fait l'objet du litige en question.

<<5077.14;5097.94;fr>>
Et le gouvernement termine par une observation générale et cette observation générale, le gouvernement est bien conscient du fait que le contexte général de l'affaire peut poser des doutes quant à des traitements discriminatoires contraires aux acquis européens.

<<5098.1;5112.26;fr>>
Mais cet état d'esprit général, il ne faut en aucun cas nous inciter à négliger les défaillances juridiques dont souffre concrètement la requête sous examen en tant que requête individuelle.

<<5112.26;5112.26;fr>>
Je vous remercie.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5113.3;5116.46;fr>>
Merci beaucoup, Madame Pelekou.

<<5116.62;5118.82;fr>>
Je comprends que le gouvernement a terminé.

<<5118.82;5120.42;fr>>
Non, Madame Telalian.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<5124.44;5126.82;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<5126.82;5131.94;en>>
Mr. President, allow me to take up a comment that was made

<<5131.94;5140.52;en>>
earlier by the Council for the applicants regarding the territorial application of the Treaty of Lausanne.

<<5140.52;5154.92;en>>
Although I explained, I think, quite clearly what Article 45 of the treaty stipulates, I feel obliged to supplement my comments, earlier comments.

<<5154.92;5166.62;en>>
And let me start by saying that there is a well-established principle of international law regarding the territorial scope of the application of international treaties.

<<5166.62;5180.92;en>>
And according to this principle, this scope may also be inferred by reason of their subject matter, their terms, or the circumstances of their conclusion.

<<5180.92;5189.42;en>>
And this is well reflected, actually, in the commentary to draft Article 58 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties.

<<5189.42;5192.62;en>>
Actually, it's paragraph two of this commentary.

<<5192.62;5215.22;en>>
So allow me to emphasize once more that the letter of Article 45 is very clear in this respect, because according to this article, the minority protection system of the Lausanne Treaty applies only to the Muslim minority inhabitants of Western Thrace.

<<5215.22;5232.12;en>>
Actually, the drafters of the treaty were aware at that time that the only such minority that remains in Greek territory was the Muslim minority that was excluded from the compulsory exchange of populations.

<<5232.12;5237.82;en>>
I mentioned earlier the treaty on the basis of which this was done.

<<5237.82;5259.22;en>>
So both from the letter of Article 45, but also from the background historical context, it is very clear that the Treaty of Lausanne is applicable only when it comes to protection of minority provisions, applies only to the area of Western Thrace.

<<5259.22;5275.12;en>>
Let me also emphasize that the reason why, when it comes to Greece, the convention speaks only about one minority, the Muslim minority, but when it comes to Turkey, it uses the minority in plural.

<<5275.12;5276.72;en>>
This is not by chance.

<<5276.72;5288.92;en>>
This was very carefully drafted in order exactly to encapsulate these questions and the realities on the ground, the historical realities on the ground at that time.

<<5288.92;5293.62;en>>
Now, let me now answer another question.

<<5293.62;5463.82;en>>
Question in French in French in French in French in French in French in French in French in French in French in French in French in French in French in French in French in French Now, I would like to turn to another question which was similar to the question put by Judge Sicilianos, and this has to do actually with, as I understood it, it has to do with the reciprocity principle that is included in the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 in Article 45.

<<5463.82;5482.22;en>>
Let me say that we in Greece, the successive Greek governments have accorded protection to this minority without linking this protection to interstate relations.

<<5482.22;5486.62;en>>
I would like to mention it with emphasis.

<<5486.62;5508.82;en>>
I mean, there are declarations made by the governments where they emphasize that they apply the system of protection fully respecting the principle that is at the heart of the system of the European Convention of Human Rights, and that reciprocity does not apply in matters of protection of human rights.

<<5508.82;5525.02;en>>
So I would like once again to emphasize that the Lausanne Treaty, which guarantees together with full equality before the law and equal treatment, also guarantees special minority rights, educational, linguistic, etc.,

<<5525.02;5530.12;en>>
and these rights go beyond the general rights guaranteed by human rights conventions.

<<5530.12;5542.62;en>>
So it is clear that no reciprocity is implemented, despite the fact that explicitly Article 45 refers to such a reciprocity.

<<5542.62;5548.72;en>>
Mr. President, I don't know if there are still more questions to which we haven't answered,

<<5548.72;5558.12;en>>
but this is actually the submission of the Greek government regarding the questions posed earlier.

<<5558.12;5558.12;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5558.77;5561.73;en>>
Thank you very much Mrs. Telalian.

<<5562.13;5568.13;en>>
Now for the applicant, I don't know whether Professor Tselikis or, No Mr. Ktistakis, please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<5569.77;5580.21;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court, this is the original of the decision

<<5580.21;5583.69;en>>
delivered by the Mufti in phrase.

<<5583.69;5591.49;en>>
There are more than 4,000 decisions of one page in all Ottoman language.

<<5591.49;5593.37;en>>
Is this a leak of certainty?

<<5593.37;5599.29;en>>
Is any forcibility of the law for the people, for the Muslim people in Greece?

<<5599.29;5600.89;en>>
No.

<<5600.89;5610.37;en>>
The husband of the applicant decides not to submit his testimony in this situation.

<<5610.37;5636.37;en>>
And that's why he decides to go to the public notary, who, yes, is a public servant, he's a jurist and he's controlled by the local prosecutor, and prepare his testimony in order to guarantee the legal certainty of the Greek civil law and the forcibility of the Greek civil law, to avoid a situation like this.

<<5636.37;5650.17;en>>
Then the First Distance Court and the Court of Appeal in phrase, they accept that this testimony was valid.

<<5650.17;5651.17;en>>
Why?

<<5651.17;5668.37;en>>
Because there are thousands of this testimony from Muslim people in the same area, Greek Muslim citizens, because they wanted to avoid a situation like this for their families, the members of their families and their heirs.

<<5668.37;5679.17;en>>
Finally, the Court of Cassation quashed twice this judgment of the Court of Appeal.

<<5679.17;5693.73;en>>
And there is one more case after the last court decision of 2017, and I'm answering to the question of Mr. Sisylianos, which is the last six months, and we have already submitted

<<5693.73;5706.41;en>>
to our observation, in another case, where again the Court of Cassation accepted the validity of the Treaty of Athens.

<<5706.41;5732.77;en>>
This is the situation, and the notary, of course, informed the member of the minority, the husband of the applicant, about the situation, but there were thousands, as my colleague will explain to you, thousands of testimony, public testimony, because the member of minority wanted to avoid this situation with the Mufti.

<<5732.77;5741.73;en>>
Then the legal, the question about the legal expectation of the sisters of the testator.

<<5741.73;5767.77;en>>
And yes, according to our documents, which have been already submitted with our application initially to the Secretariat, the sisters of the husband of the applicant, a few years before, they accepted when their brother, another brother passed away, they accepted the inheritance according to civil law.

<<5767.77;5781.25;en>>
They didn't object to the inheritance from their parents, but they object for the inheritance — for their inheritance rights of their brother, the husband of the applicant.

<<5781.25;5796.93;en>>
And they didn't have legal expectation, and they have never exercised vis-à-vis their parents the same objection like they did in this case.

<<5796.93;5798.37;en>>
Why?

<<5798.37;5802.73;en>>
Because it was the wife of their brother that they were objecting.

<<5802.73;5809.69;en>>
And this has a difference, as my colleague will explain to you, because the shares are different.

<<5809.69;5820.77;en>>
Finally, of course there is an issue of negative freedom of religion, and that's why our ground about discrimination is based on religion.

<<5820.77;5829.37;en>>
And my last remark about the Lausanne Treaty and the minority situation in Turkey.

<<5829.37;5846.81;en>>
Since 1927, since 1927, the Turkish authorities have abolished the Byzantine civil family inheritance law for the Greek Orthodox minority of Turkey.

<<5846.81;5853.13;en>>
And there were no problem, no contestation from the part of Greece.

<<5853.13;5858.69;en>>
Only Greece still applies Sharia law.

<<5858.69;5871.21;en>>
On the basis of Treaty of Lausanne, as the respondent just explained to the court, applies Sharia for the members of the Muslim minority protected by the Treaty of Lausanne.

<<5871.21;5887.85;en>>
The minorities in Turkey have abolished this right, if there is such a right, since 1927 with the introduction of the Turkish civil code in the Turkish legal order.

<<5887.85;5892.21;en>>
Mr President, distinguished members of the court, now I pass the floor to my colleague.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5892.51;5895.12;en>>
Thank you very much, Professor Tsitselikis.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<5895.86;5899.62;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished member of the court,

<<5899.62;5905.3;en>>
I will finish with the last questions remaining to be answered.

<<5905.3;5912.46;en>>
So about the mulk, the mulk is a category of Islamic property.

<<5912.46;5915.02;en>>
When Sharia is applicable.

<<5915.02;5934.1;en>>
So properties in Greece, when Greek citizens, Muslims, want to apply Sharia inheritance law, then they can call the properties mulk because there are two more categories, or vakuf, of community properties or public properties.

<<5934.1;5940.36;en>>
So according to Sharia law, there are some special rules about the mulk or the other.

<<5940.36;5943.06;en>>
The argument by the government is the reverse.

<<5943.06;5951.96;en>>
And the court of cassation, that because it was a mulk, this has to be Sharia's applicable law, which is not correct.

<<5951.96;5961.48;en>>
So the testator was a Greek citizen who decided to draft a public will.

<<5961.48;5963.72;en>>
So he wanted to be seen as a Muslim.

<<5963.72;5970.96;en>>
So his property is not a mulk because the Sharia law wouldn't be applicable in that case, according to his wish.

<<5970.96;5978.56;en>>
But according to the Greek court of cassation, the property was seen as a mulk, which is a bit peculiar.

<<5978.56;5985.84;en>>
So what happens if the reverse was?

<<5985.84;5990.0;en>>
We have a case that, let's say, the wife dies.

<<5990.0;6004.2;en>>
So according to Sharia law, and I can quote the Holy Quran, is according to Surah Nisa, paragraph 12, the lot for men is double.

<<6004.2;6010.2;en>>
So it gets the half of the property.

<<6010.2;6021.28;en>>
And the most important question, I think, is, again, that if the applicant was not a Muslim, the court, the Sharia law, wouldn't be applicable.

<<6021.28;6021.78;en>>
Why?

<<6021.78;6034.32;en>>
Because the Sunnah says that an inherited property from a Muslim cannot go to the hands of a non-Muslim.

<<6034.32;6042.48;en>>
So it's clear that we wouldn't have this case if the applicant was not a Muslim.

<<6042.48;6049.76;en>>
So as a Muslim woman, as a Muslim wife, that's why we have two different standards.

<<6049.76;6053.88;en>>
Just first, because she was a Muslim, and second, because she was a wife.

<<6053.88;6062.8;en>>
And here, the important question about the proportionality, we have a disproportionate measure.

<<6062.8;6071.04;en>>
So the measure, first of all, is that we have to compare the interstate succession versus a public will.

<<6071.04;6076.44;en>>
So here, the most important element, the crucial element, is the wish of the testator.

<<6076.44;6094.64;en>>
So the whole case is about the court of cassation decided against the wish of the testator to replace the civil law regarding a public will with the Sharia law on interstate succession.

<<6094.64;6098.92;en>>
So we have an absolutely disproportionate system.

<<6098.92;6112.2;en>>
But the most important here is that, again, we have a disproportionality as regards the free will of someone, the testator, versus an obligation which is not existent.

<<6112.2;6118.12;en>>
So we're talking about the right of someone to choose or to opt for Sharia law.

<<6118.12;6124.16;en>>
And here, the court of cassation applies mandatorily the Sharia law without the wish.

<<6124.16;6129.8;en>>
So it's clear to our eyes the disproportion between the two systems.

<<6133.6;6145.08;en>>
I think that the question of the interstate succession I think this will have completed our remarks.

<<6145.08;6145.08;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<6148.09;6152.57;en>>
Professor, we have now come to the end of the hearing.

<<6152.57;6159.01;en>>
I thank the parties for their submissions and answers to the court's questions.

<<6159.01;6164.33;en>>
The court will now deliberate on the admissibility and merits.

<<6164.33;6167.71;en>>
The judgments will be delivered later.

<<6167.71;6171.55;en>>
The parties will be informed of the date of delivery.

<<6171.55;6173.49;en>>
I declare the hearing closed.

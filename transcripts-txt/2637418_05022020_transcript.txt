La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<69.16;69.88;en>>
Please be seated.

<<95.03;103.99;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the merits of the case in Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson versus Iceland.

<<103.99;117.83;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on 31st May, 2018, under Article 34 of the Convention by an Icelandic national, Mr. Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson .

<<117.83;126.59;en>>
The application was allocated to the second section of the court, pursuant to Rule 52, Paragraph 1 of the Rules of Court.

<<126.59;133.19;en>>
The application was communicated to the government on 19th June, 2018.

<<133.19;140.43;en>>
On 12th March, 2019, a chamber of the second section delivered its judgment in the case.

<<140.43;155.03;en>>
It declared the application admissible unanimously and held by five votes to two that there had been a violation of Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the Convention as regards the right to a tribunal established by law.

<<155.03;172.31;en>>
On 14th May, 2019, the government requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention, and the panel of the Grand Chamber accepted the request on 9th September, 2019.

<<172.31;194.55;en>>
On 2nd December, 2019, the President of the Grand Chamber granted leave to the government of Poland the Public Defender Ombudsman of Georgia and the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights to submit written comments in the proceedings as third parties by virtue of Rule 44, Paragraph 3 of the Rules of Court.

<<194.55;207.51;en>>
On 10th December, 2019, the President also granted leave to submit written comments in the proceedings as a third party to the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Republic of Poland.

<<207.51;216.07;en>>
The government are represented by their Acting Agent, Mrs. Þorsteinsdóttir, the Acting Attorney General,

<<216.07;220.31;en>>
who is assisted by Mr. Otty QC Counsel,

<<220.31;224.91;en>>
Mrs. Arnardóttir and Mrs. Thejll, Deputy Agents,

<<224.91;228.15;en>>
and Mr. Molyneaux, Advisor.

<<228.15;235.19;en>>
The applicant is represented by Mr. Vilhjálmsson, Supreme Court Attorney.

<<235.19;238.95;en>>
I welcome the representatives in the name of the Court.

<<238.95;245.39;en>>
I also welcome a delegation of Ukrainian judges on a study visit to the Court.

<<245.39;254.87;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and the representative of the applicant, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<254.87;259.75;en>>
Mr. Vilhjálmsson for the applicant will speak first,

<<259.75;265.47;en>>
and then Mrs. Þorsteinsdóttir and Mr. Otty for the government.

<<265.47;280.35;en>>
I would explain that in addition to interpreting in the two official languages of the Court, English and French, interpreting into Russian has been authorised for the benefit of a group of lawyers from Russia attending this hearing.

<<280.35;287.03;en>>
This interpretation is not part of the official interpretation of the proceedings as organised by the Court.

<<287.03;289.83;en>>
I call the applicant.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<302.4;306.0;en>>
Mr. President, Members of the Court,

<<306.0;312.68;en>>
I address the Court on behalf of my client, Gudmundur Andri Aastraarsson.

<<312.68;331.48;en>>
The central issue at stake in this case is the continued meaningful protection of probably the most important principle within Article 6 of the Convention, the right to a tribunal established by law.

<<331.48;344.28;en>>
Without a real protection of this principle, the applicant contends that the rest of the rights of Article 6, paragraph 1, would be terminally undermined.

<<344.28;360.84;en>>
The applicant maintains that the way to guard this principle and ensure its continued relevance is to confirm the well-reasoned and correct chamber judgment and find for the applicant in this case.

<<360.84;369.44;en>>
On the other hand, to overturn the chamber judgment would seriously damage the protection of this principle.

<<369.44;377.24;en>>
This is the core of the applicant's arguments in this case.

<<377.24;386.0;en>>
Before proceeding further, I will seek to provide answers to the three questions put forth by the Court.

<<386.0;389.84;en>>
The answer to the first question is this.

<<389.84;405.72;en>>
According to the temporary provision to the Act on the Judiciary, it is clear that the Minister would only be required to submit new proposals to replace the refused candidates.

<<405.72;412.56;en>>
The second question is first and foremost for the government to answer.

<<412.56;435.16;en>>
However, the applicant is of the opinion that this list or a group of 24 candidates for the judicial posts in the Court of Appeal does not exist and never existed, and therefore this matter has no significance for this case.

<<435.16;441.36;en>>
Regarding the third question, the applicant answers as follows.

<<441.36;455.8;en>>
Icelandic law on criminal procedure provides the Supreme Court with an authority to reopen a case if an earlier process was sustainably flawed.

<<455.8;464.88;en>>
This criteria is general in nature, and its application depends on the facts of each case.

<<464.88;475.36;en>>
Here, we have a situation where a judge has been appointed by a flagrant violation of law.

<<475.36;483.0;en>>
On the face of it, such fundamental flaw seems to merit reopening.

<<483.0;491.96;en>>
In the Supreme Court's case law, however, there is no judgment that deals with similar situation.

<<491.96;506.8;en>>
There is only a recent judgment concerning a different set of facts indicating that the Supreme Court will interpret the substantially flawed criteria restrictively.

<<506.8;513.96;en>>
Therefore, the question on the right to file for a reopening has no clear answer at this stage.

<<517.72;524.96;en>>
I will now turn to the background to the facts of the present case.

<<524.96;535.2;en>>
There is, regrettably, a long-standing tendency in Iceland of political meddling in the appointment of judges.

<<535.2;544.84;en>>
In 2003 and 2004, the Minister of Justice appointed two judges to the Supreme Court.

<<544.84;555.24;en>>
In these appointments, the Minister decided not to abide by the recommendations of the Supreme Court.

<<555.24;568.8;en>>
In 2007, the Minister of Justice appointed a district court judge in direct opposition with the proposal of an evaluation committee.

<<568.8;583.04;en>>
In all these instances, the appointments were clearly political in nature because the appointees were closely connected to the Independence Party.

<<583.04;591.28;en>>
In 2010, comprehensive changes were made to the stipulations on the appointment of judges.

<<591.28;605.16;en>>
In broad terms, the changes meant that the power of appointment was effectively withdrawn from the Minister of Justice and put in the hands of an evaluation committee.

<<605.16;614.68;en>>
The purpose of this was clear, to stop political corruption and the abuse of power in the appointment of judges.

<<619.24;642.32;en>>
There is no doubt that these changes can be directly traced to the harsh criticism and public outcry that resulted from the repeated political appointments of judges in 2003, 2004, and 2007.

<<642.32;650.38;en>>
A few years after this, in 2016, a new act on the judiciary was enacted.

<<650.38;660.4;en>>
One of its main purpose was to limit further the influence of the executive branch on judicial appointments.

<<660.4;671.2;en>>
It was also meant to ensure a proper and professional mechanism for the evaluation of judicial candidates.

<<671.2;681.96;en>>
These changes in 2010 and 2016 aimed to rule out that a minister's whim could decide a judicial appointment.

<<686.12;694.32;en>>
The new act on the judiciary from 2016 also contained a special provision.

<<694.32;709.68;en>>
In the event of the Minister of Justice decided to go against the proposals of the evaluation committee, the decision would need the consent of Parliament.

<<709.68;731.04;en>>
There is no doubt that the enactment of this special rule was meant to be a further safeguard against possible overstepping or abuse by the executive branch, and therefore to uphold and maintain public trust in a judiciary independent from the executive branch.

<<736.32;746.52;en>>
I will now turn to the appointments of judges to the Court of Appeal in spring 2017.

<<746.52;754.48;en>>
Unfortunately, even the best and most ambitious laws will come to nothing if they are not followed.

<<754.48;775.34;en>>
That is exactly what happened in this case when the former Minister of Justice decided to go against the recent decision of the evaluation committee and replaced four of the 15 most qualified candidates with four others less qualified.

<<775.34;788.66;en>>
With the judgment of the Supreme Court from 19 December 2017, it was found that the former Minister of Justice had violated the law in the appointment process.

<<788.66;796.08;en>>
As a result, two of the four refused candidates were awarded damages by the Supreme Court.

<<796.08;806.5;en>>
The Supreme Court also found that the procedure deployed by Parliament in the appointment process had been defective.

<<806.5;821.82;en>>
In two judgments from 25 October 2018, the District Court of Reykjavik found that the two remaining refused candidates had rightful claims for damages.

<<821.82;835.54;en>>
Taking into account those conclusions and arguments by the Istanbul courts, the applicant holds that the following summary of these facts has to be considered true and undeniable.

<<838.46;851.9;en>>
The multiply law violations during the appointment process made the panel of judges on the Court of Appeal very different from what would have been the case if the law had been followed.

<<851.9;861.62;en>>
I will now turn to the Supreme Court judgment of May 24, 2018.

<<861.62;874.38;en>>
In May 2018, the Supreme Court ruled on the applicant's appeal and rejected the applicant's claim to quash the judgment of the Court of Appeal and order a retrial.

<<874.38;894.18;en>>
In the judgment, the Supreme Court did not especially evaluate whether the violations of the former Minister of Justice and Parliament should be deemed serious in nature or just deviations of little or none consequences.

<<894.18;912.02;en>>
However, the judgment directly refers to the judgment of the Supreme Court of 19 December 2017 and states that those judgments have full evidentiary value in the applicant's case as well.

<<915.02;922.42;en>>
With that in mind, one should recall one of the central conclusions of those former judgments by the Supreme Court.

<<925.1;942.26;en>>
And that was namely the judgment of the Supreme Court and that was namely that the former Minister of Justice had broken the rules on the appointment of judges in complete disregard of the obvious danger of such violations.

<<945.94;956.14;en>>
And let me respectfully remind the Court, obvious danger, complete disregard.

<<956.14;964.3;en>>
This is the Supreme Court's own harsh judgment on the actions of the former Minister.

<<964.3;982.06;en>>
This condemnation by the Supreme Court must be understood to mean that the violations by the former Minister of Justice should be considered as having been committed either deliberately or by such gross negligence that it borders on intent.

<<985.82;993.56;en>>
It has therefore been shown that the violations of the former Minister of Justice in the appointment process were grave.

<<996.82;1015.94;en>>
Supported by the case law of this Court, they should therefore rightfully have led to the conclusion that the applicant's sentence by the Court of Appeal to be quashed and the case retried before a court established by law.

<<1015.94;1022.06;en>>
Regrettably, the Supreme Court did not rise to the occasion and reach the correct conclusion.

<<1025.86;1033.66;en>>
Regarding the seriousness of the violations by Parliament itself, one point must be made.

<<1033.66;1058.86;en>>
It is mistakenly stated in the judgment of the Supreme Court in the applicant's case that the Supreme Court had previously, in its judgment in December 2017, considered it a minor defect that Parliament did not follow the clear and unconditional legal duty to vote on each candidate separately.

<<1058.86;1072.9;en>>
No such reasoning can be found in the Supreme Court's judgment from 2017, as was correctly pointed out in paragraph 120 in the chamber judgment.

<<1072.9;1078.42;en>>
This statement of the Supreme Court in the applicant's case is therefore simply wrong.

<<1082.98;1093.82;en>>
It also confirms that the Supreme Court did not independently evaluate the seriousness of the violations of Parliament in the appointment process.

<<1098.3;1102.06;en>>
I will now turn to the seriousness of the Icelandic state's violations.

<<1102.06;1113.22;en>>
To start with, I refer to my previous arguments regarding the Supreme Court's harsh remarks in its judgment in December 2017.

<<1113.22;1120.26;en>>
In that context, it should be borne in mind that the former Minister of Justice is a lawyer.

<<1120.26;1138.14;en>>
She was a practicing attorney in Iceland from 2007 to 2015, as well as being a member of the Judiciary Committee and thus being a member of the Judicial Council from 2004 to 2009.

<<1138.14;1152.62;en>>
It is therefore clear she had, as a specialist, a personal knowledge of Icelandic law, including rules regarding legal principles relevant to the court system and to the appointment of judges.

<<1156.86;1169.38;en>>
There is also clear written evidence that legal staff of the ministry repeatedly and forcefully pointed out to the former minister how she was legally obliged to act.

<<1173.14;1178.78;en>>
It is also clear how the minister reacted to this well-founded advice.

<<1181.38;1182.58;en>>
She simply ignored it.

<<1185.58;1194.74;en>>
That fact still further supports that the violations in the appointment process were committed deliberately.

<<1194.74;1208.38;en>>
Last but not least, when the minister decided to put aside more qualified candidates in favor of less qualified ones, it can be asked whether her actions can be viewed as plain abuse of power.

<<1213.26;1242.02;en>>
Here, the applicant refers to the strange turn of events in late 2017 when an Independence Party MP, BN, relinquished his first place seat on the Independence Party election ticket in Reykjavik South to the former Minister of Justice only a few months after the minister appointed the MP's wife, AE, to the Court of Appeal.

<<1242.02;1257.58;en>>
In this respect, the applicant further refers to its written submissions to the Grand Chamber, paragraphs 40 to 46, where these events are explained and examined more closely.

<<1259.86;1273.94;en>>
From the applicant's point of view, it is hard to reject or to try to explain this turn of events as being coincidences, one after another.

<<1273.94;1282.26;en>>
Instead, this seems to suggest or point towards abuse of power.

<<1282.26;1299.62;en>>
Last but not least, it must be held in mind that the former minister's own stated reason for ignoring the Evaluation Committee's proposal have from the start not stood up to the current not stood up to any serious scrutiny.

<<1302.74;1317.02;en>>
Let us remember that the former Minister of Justice explained the changes to the candidates list with a reference to gender equality and judicial experience.

<<1317.02;1320.88;en>>
Those arguments are not convincing.

<<1320.88;1334.58;en>>
Firstly, one of the refused candidates was a district court judge that had been ranked higher than all four district court judges that the former minister chose to appoint instead.

<<1338.74;1350.66;en>>
Secondly, she appointed a male district court judge that had been ranked number 30 but decided to ignore a female district court judge that was ranked number 22.

<<1350.66;1360.54;en>>
This surely rules out the minister's own justifications for her actions and point instead to abuse of power.

<<1360.54;1370.38;en>>
From all this, it is clear that the violations of the former Minister of Justice were extremely serious, as was rightly concluded by the chamber in its judgment.

<<1371.78;1389.82;en>>
Regarding the violations of Parliament, regarding the violations of Parliament, the Supreme Court completely failed to evaluate the seriousness in its judgment in the applicant's case.

<<1389.82;1401.74;en>>
Instead, the Supreme Court wrongly stated that they had already been evaluated and found to be minor in its judgment in December 2017.

<<1401.74;1415.06;en>>
No sensible explanations have been given on why Parliament decided to disregard a clear and unmistakable legal stipulation in this way.

<<1415.06;1423.58;en>>
Whatever the reason for this, it is indisputable that this was a conscious and controlled decision by Parliament.

<<1427.5;1441.14;en>>
As a consequence, this decision has to be considered a deliberate violation, which makes it especially grave.

<<1441.14;1450.7;en>>
The question then arises, why did Parliament decide to violate a clear statutory in the law?

<<1450.7;1456.14;en>>
To the applicant, this question is not difficult to answer.

<<1456.14;1473.06;en>>
This was the only way to get Parliament to pass the former Minister of Justice's proposal to appoint to the Court of Appeal the four candidates that had not been ranked among the 15 most qualified ones.

<<1473.06;1483.94;en>>
It was simply found impossible for political reasons to vote on each candidate separately.

<<1483.94;1491.3;en>>
To understand this, one must only consider what the procedure would have meant.

<<1491.3;1515.3;en>>
To take just one example, Parliament would then have had to directly reject a candidate, EJ, ranked among the most qualified at number seven, in favor of a candidate ranked much lower, for example, JF, who had been ranked at number 30.

<<1515.3;1527.86;en>>
With this in mind, it is sadly evident that in this matter, Parliament utterly failed to act as a control or check upon the executive power.

<<1527.86;1540.42;en>>
And in doing so, it ignored and neglected a legal duty entrusted to Parliament for those exact circumstances.

<<1540.42;1551.26;en>>
Regrettably, it is plain that the matter was instead driven to its preordered and desired conclusion along political lines.

<<1551.26;1560.18;en>>
The appointments were hustled through Parliament with unlawful procedure by a government majority making use of its voting power.

<<1563.54;1580.42;en>>
Again, it is therefore clear that the violations of the Minister of Justice and Parliament directly resulted in the Court of Appeal being made up of other judges as its founding than would have been the case if the law had been observed.

<<1583.14;1592.1;en>>
The applicant holds that violations with such serious consequences can never be ranked or justified as minor deviations.

<<1597.38;1623.94;en>>
If that was the case, the principle in Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Convention, that a tribunal shall be established by law, could not be deemed to offer citizens meaningful protection against state authority as correctly concluded in paragraph 123 in the Chamber judgment.

<<1623.94;1634.94;en>>
The violations of the Minister of Justice and Parliament must therefore be viewed as flagrant breaches of law.

<<1634.94;1652.14;en>>
It must also be taken into account that the case involves the violations of two branches of government, that is, the legislative and executive branches, against the interest and integrity of the third, the judicial branch.

<<1652.14;1670.1;en>>
The violations were against laws and rules that are meant to ensure that professional and legal procedure is followed in the appointment process of judges, and thereby to protect the independence of the judicial branch.

<<1671.38;1678.02;en>>
I will now turn to the case law of this court.

<<1678.02;1694.14;en>>
Regarding the case law of the judicial branch, regarding the definition of law within the meaning of Article 6, paragraph 1, the applicant refers to paragraph 70 and 71 in the applicant's written submissions to the Grand Chamber.

<<1694.14;1703.06;en>>
The applicant will, however, take a closer look at how this criteria has been interpreted in the case law of this court.

<<1703.06;1715.94;en>>
The following principle in the case law of the court has been used to assess the seriousness of violations against rules on judicial appointments in the national law of member states.

<<1715.94;1724.42;en>>
Here, a reference is made to paragraphs 100 to 103 in the Chamber Judgment.

<<1724.42;1738.46;en>>
Number one, can the violations be traced to more than one branch of state authority, that is, a breach of both the legislative and executive branches?

<<1738.46;1745.86;en>>
Number two, have the violations been confirmed by the court of the state in question?

<<1745.86;1758.1;en>>
Number three, do the violations concern principles that constitute an inseparable part of the foundation and function of the justice system?

<<1758.1;1774.22;en>>
And number four, can the violations be described as intentional breach of national law, or have they been committed by gross negligence?

<<1774.22;1788.22;en>>
Lastly, this court has increasingly, in its jurisprudence, based its findings on the principle of separation of power, in this instance between the judicial and executive branch.

<<1788.22;1805.04;en>>
In that respect, it has been examined whether the executive branch has improperly undermined public faith and trust in legally established processes on the appointment of judges.

<<1805.04;1818.02;en>>
The applicant submits that all of those five principles clearly apply to the violations committed by the former Minister of Justice and Parliament.

<<1818.02;1828.0;en>>
It was therefore correctly concluded in the chamber judgment that the procedure had been seriously flawed by flagrant breaches of national law.

<<1832.32;1847.96;en>>
In this context, it is worth examining whether the principle of legal certainty can have a significance when assessing a possible violation of the principle that a tribunal is established by law.

<<1847.96;1855.52;en>>
It is not quite clear to what extent the principle of legal certainty applies in this respect.

<<1855.52;1866.0;en>>
It is, however, clear that the principle does not apply when there has been a flagrant breach of the law, like in the present case.

<<1866.0;1883.52;en>>
Regarding this argument, I refer to paragraph 107 to 109 in the opinion of Attorney General Eleanor Shetlestone from 12 September 2019.

<<1883.52;1893.92;en>>
Furthermore, how can the principle of legal certainty be said to have any impact on this case when the following is considered?

<<1897.32;1911.16;en>>
As earlier described, the Supreme Court had in its judgment of December 2017 concluded that the appointment process had been flawed due to serious violations of the applicable law.

<<1913.72;1926.4;en>>
That was more than 10 days before the appointments of the judges of the Court of Appeal came into effect on 1 January 2018.

<<1926.4;1939.68;en>>
This harsh condemnation by the Supreme Court on the unlawfulness of the appointment process was therefore known to all in Iceland before the appointed judges even took office.

<<1942.72;1949.48;en>>
In spite of that, the Icelandic state willingly decided to act as if nothing had happened.

<<1952.32;1966.84;en>>
Therefore, the Icelandic state cannot in good faith defeat legal certainty in this case.

<<1966.84;1971.28;en>>
Mr. President, members of the Court, for six decades

<<1971.28;1977.16;en>>
this court has been at the forefront of protection of human rights.

<<1977.16;1983.24;en>>
It can safely be said that its work has been of great importance.

<<1983.24;2008.68;en>>
The established by law principle must be understood to mean not only that a tribunal be established by law in strictly formal and narrow sense, it must also and very possibly more importantly be understood as a requirement that any actions in the court of establishing a tribunal must be lawful in all relevant material sense.

<<2008.68;2019.8;en>>
In other words, no law can freely be broken, bent, or ignored during the establishment of courts of law.

<<2019.8;2038.96;en>>
To quote famous words centuries old from a text closely related to the subject matter here today, the applicant finds this straightforward and sensible understanding of Article 6, paragraph 1, to be self-evident.

<<2038.96;2052.24;en>>
Unfortunately, the state of Iceland is of another view in contesting this case with the support of its recent brothers in arms, the Republic of Poland.

<<2052.24;2072.2;en>>
The applicant therefore places his trust in this court to uphold and safeguard for him and other citizens in the jurisdiction of the Republic of Poland jurisdiction of the court the continuing meaningful protection of this central and most important principle of the convention.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<2080.76;2084.76;en>>
Thank you. I call Mr. Þorsteinsdóttir, please.

<<2084.76;2085.26;en>>
You have the floor.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<2094.7;2097.58;en>>
Mr. President, Members of the Court,

<<2097.58;2105.4;en>>
The Government emphasises at the outset its profound respect for the role of this Court and the rule of law.

<<2105.4;2119.18;en>>
The Government has repeatedly responded in a responsible and constructive manner to the decisions of the Court, even where very substantial disruption and cost in implementation has been involved.

<<2119.18;2130.5;en>>
At the institution of the Court of Appeal, the subject of these proceedings was itself established in response to an earlier judgment of this Court.

<<2130.5;2152.54;en>>
In the present context, and consistent with the rule of law, the domestic courts have provided full access to court for those judicial candidates who were disappointed by the appointment process, and where the Supreme Court has granted damages to those individuals, the Government has complied fully with the Supreme Court's rulings.

<<2152.54;2159.58;en>>
Furthermore, since the Chamber judgment, neither Judge A.E. nor any of the three judges who

<<2159.58;2170.86;en>>
were appointed at the same time and were not among the 15 whom the Evaluation Committee had suggested, have sat in any Court of Appeal proceedings.

<<2170.86;2191.98;en>>
But this state of paralysis cannot, it is submitted, be allowed to continue, and the Court contends that the Grand Chamber should now bring it to an end by finding that whatever test is applied to the meaning of established by law on the facts of this case, there was no violation of the Convention.

<<2191.98;2207.34;en>>
This should be the outcome, having regard to the principle of subsidiarity, to the lack of substantive merit in the applicants' complaints, and to the fundamental principles of judicial security of tenure and legal certainty.

<<2207.34;2213.18;en>>
Mr. President, Mr. Ohti will address the law, but before he does so, I would like to emphasize

<<2213.18;2222.62;en>>
12 central elements of the factual background to this case, and to respond to the Court's most recent questions.

<<2222.62;2235.02;en>>
First, there is no doubt that the Court of Appeal, which determined the applicants' proceedings, has a clear and express foundation in Icelandic law as an institution.

<<2235.02;2244.46;en>>
It was established by a law which came into force in June 2016, and the Court formally came into being on 1 January 2018.

<<2244.46;2258.6;en>>
Second, this being a new Court, there was no established precedent as to how the appointment process governing proposals to Parliament should proceed, or as to how Parliament should vote on such proposals.

<<2258.6;2263.06;en>>
See documents 2, 3 and 24.

<<2263.06;2268.74;en>>
Third, the Minister of Justice, who proposed Judge A.E. for appointment, was not, as a

<<2268.74;2275.74;en>>
matter of law, bound to propose the first 15 candidates identified by the Evaluation Committee.

<<2275.74;2283.34;en>>
It was instead open to her to propose to Parliament other individuals who had the requisite qualifications, such as A.E.

<<2283.34;2305.62;en>>
Furthermore, even the Evaluation Committee has now recognised that its earlier procedure was flawed, because evidenced by documents 65 to 60 cc, it now adopts a practice of nominating more candidates than are needed and allowing the Minister to choose between them.

<<2305.62;2313.86;en>>
Fourth, in making her proposals, the Minister placed weight on judicial experience and gender balance.

<<2313.86;2334.66;en>>
These were two objectively legitimate factors endorsed both by the Icelandic Association of Judges and by all party leaders when they made it clear to the Minister that the Committee's original proposals could not pass through Parliament without amendment because of issues of gender equality.

<<2334.66;2339.3;en>>
See documents 10, 25a to b and 26 to 28.

<<2339.3;2351.38;en>>
Fifth, there was a complete transparency when the Minister set out her position and the key criteria she was applying in memorandum to Parliament.

<<2351.38;2360.86;en>>
She engaged in detailed discussions with the Constitutional Supervisory Committee of Parliament and she had guidance from external experts.

<<2360.86;2364.5;en>>
See documents 28 and 63.

<<2364.5;2371.3;en>>
Sixth, Judge A.E. was fully qualified for appointment as a judge to the Court.

<<2371.3;2382.98;en>>
She had an exemplary record as an Associate Judge for more than 10 years, a District Court Judge for 14 years and a Chief Judge of the Labour Court for 7 years.

<<2382.98;2395.82;en>>
The Independent Evaluation Committee had found her to be fully eligible for appointment and she had more judicial experience than any of the candidates excluded from the Minister's lists.

<<2395.82;2400.5;en>>
These are documents 4 and 44.

<<2400.5;2410.86;en>>
Seventh, Parliament retained full oversight and it approved the appointment of all 15 judges proposed, including A.E.

<<2410.86;2425.1;en>>
Although complaint is now made that this approval was conferred by a single collective vote, this was a procedure proposed by the Speaker of Parliament and approved as lawful by the Independent Secretary of Parliament.

<<2425.1;2439.18;en>>
It had also been adopted for other matters in the past and it was not opposed by a single MP, whether Government or Opposition, despite their being told of their ability to request individual votes.

<<2439.18;2444.46;en>>
See documents 2 and 24.

<<2444.46;2464.78;en>>
Eighth, prior to that vote, it had been made apparent in conversations between the Speaker and all parliamentary groups that all MPs would vote in the same manner on every individual identified in the Minister's proposals, whether in one collective vote or individually.

<<2464.78;2467.66;en>>
This is document 24.

<<2467.66;2475.5;en>>
Ninth, Judge A.E. was appointed by the President of Iceland in June 2017 and her appointment

<<2475.5;2480.34;en>>
took effect with the new court on 1 January 2018.

<<2480.34;2494.58;en>>
Following her appointment, she became formally and fully vested with the powers of a judge of the Court of Appeal and she became entitled, under Article 61 of the Constitution, to full security of tenure.

<<2494.58;2502.02;en>>
Tenth, Judge A.E.'s conduct since her appointment has continued to be exemplary.

<<2502.02;2520.42;en>>
There is no evidence of any public concern about her good faith, professional integrity or competence or of that of any of her colleagues and there is no evidence of any pattern of inappropriate executive interference with judicial appointments in Iceland.

<<2520.42;2529.94;en>>
Eleventh, the only two defects identified in the appointment process by the domestic courts were of a technical nature.

<<2529.94;2535.26;en>>
No domestic court has ever suggested that either defect made any difference to A.E.'s

<<2535.26;2536.26;en>>
appointment.

<<2536.26;2542.08;en>>
None of the unsuccessful candidates has ever suggested A.E.'s appointment should be invalidated

<<2542.08;2547.58;en>>
and the Supreme Court has rejected the applicant's central case that A.E.'s appointment should

<<2547.58;2555.62;en>>
be treated as a nullity, finding the defects to be of no significance in this regard.

<<2555.62;2580.14;en>>
And finally, the extraordinary allegations of bad faith now made by the applicant are not open to him in circumstances where they were not advanced before the domestic courts and they in any event have no evidential foundation whatever as confirmed by documents 21, 30 and 59 to 64.

<<2580.14;2587.78;en>>
I turn next to the court's three questions of 20th of December 2019.

<<2587.78;2607.18;en>>
As to the first question, although the appointment process was novel, it would have been open to Parliament to respond to the motion before it by rejecting certain candidates and by requiring only that some positions be made the subject of subsequent proposals.

<<2607.18;2614.5;en>>
Parliament would not have been required to repeat the whole procedure regarding all 15 candidates.

<<2614.5;2626.42;en>>
Not a single MP raised concern at the collective vote procedure and not a single MP, government or opposition opposed the individual judges on the minister's list.

<<2626.42;2636.08;en>>
The position of the opposition MPs before Parliament was that they had no objection to the merit or qualifications of the candidates proposed.

<<2636.08;2643.1;en>>
It was simply that more time should be devoted to the process.

<<2643.1;2653.58;en>>
As to the second question, the minister explained to Parliament that she had considered that 24 candidates were eligible.

<<2653.58;2672.12;en>>
She presented the 15 candidates which she did have in regard both to the work of the Evaluation Committee and her own judgement based on the issues of judicial experience, a matter she considered of paramount importance and gender balance.

<<2672.12;2688.14;en>>
These matters were reflected in the minister's letter to Parliament of 29 May 2017 and her memorandum of 30 May 2017, as well as in the observations she made when appearing before the Constitutional Committee.

<<2688.14;2695.02;en>>
The relevant documents are 8 to 10, 43 and 63.

<<2695.02;2715.36;en>>
As to the third question, a violation of Article 6 of the Convention does not automatically lead to the reopening of criminal proceedings, but it may provide a foundation for doing so if the conditions set out in Article 228 paragraph 1 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure are met.

<<2715.36;2724.26;en>>
One example where reopening was granted is provided by a decision of 13 June 2012.

<<2724.26;2731.22;en>>
Another where relief was refused by a decision of 21 May 2019.

<<2731.22;2737.66;en>>
The Government is of course ready to provide both decisions if that were to exist.

<<2737.66;2760.66;en>>
In the present case, as document 21 shows, the applicant's principal claim before the Supreme Court was that the judgement in his case should be overturned and referred back to the Court of Appeal, or as an alternative claim, that he be granted a complete acquittal by reference to his Article 6 arguments.

<<2760.66;2769.06;en>>
This illustrates again the issues of legal certainty that his arguments may give rise to.

<<2769.06;2773.78;en>>
Mr President, I now hand over to Mr Otty to address the Government's case on the law.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<2777.36;2779.84;en>>
Thank you very much. Mr. Otty, you have the floor.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<2779.95;2786.14;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court, the government makes three core submissions.

<<2786.14;2791.33;en>>
The first is that the applicant's case involves a breach of the principle of subsidiarity.

<<2791.33;2798.43;en>>
It requires this court to disregard the express findings of the Supreme Court without any justification.

<<2798.43;2807.37;en>>
The primary Supreme Court decision in this regard is that from the applicant's own case dated 24 May 2018, document 20.

<<2807.37;2814.03;en>>
The Supreme Court made five key findings, all set out at pages 7 to 8 of its judgment.

<<2814.03;2825.35;en>>
First the fact that Parliament did not hold individual votes was not a defect which carried any weight or significance, or which rendered the appointment of AE null and void.

<<2825.35;2852.03;en>>
That finding was unsurprising given previous parliamentary practice and the advice of the independent parliamentary secretariat, given the indications to the Speaker in advance that all MPs would vote the same way, whether voting on a collective or individual basis, and given the express opportunity provided to all MPs to ask for individual votes, an option not taken up by any of them.

<<2852.03;2860.62;en>>
Second the earlier defect in the process adopted by the Minister did not undermine the appointment of AE or her colleagues either.

<<2860.62;2883.39;en>>
As the Supreme Court stated in terms, as regards the consequences of the said shortcomings in the procedure on behalf of the Minister, what matters is that the appointment of all the 15 judges for indefinite term, which in no instance has been invalidated by a court, was realised upon the signing of their letters of appointment.

<<2883.39;2896.27;en>>
Third all of the individuals appointed, including AE, were adequately qualified by reference to what the Supreme Court described as their professional experience and legal knowledge.

<<2896.27;2910.39;en>>
Fourth on appointment AE and her colleagues enjoyed full security of tenure under Article 61 of the Constitution, and none of them could be discharged from office other than by judicial decision.

<<2910.39;2917.75;en>>
And fifth on appointment AE and her fellow judges acquired judicial powers and obligations.

<<2917.75;2926.03;en>>
They became obliged to exercise independence in their judicial work and never to act under instructions from others.

<<2926.03;2940.31;en>>
These five factors together meant that from the Supreme Court's perspective, the Court of Appeal which heard the applicant's case had to be treated as established by law and as having fully respected Article 6.

<<2940.31;2946.64;en>>
In taking this course, the Supreme Court was also following four earlier decisions.

<<2946.64;2960.07;en>>
In the two December 2017 judgments, the Court had recorded that all parliamentary groups and MPs had informed the Speaker that they would vote the same way, whether a collective vote or an individual vote were held.

<<2960.07;2975.39;en>>
Furthermore, at pages 11 to 12 of the December judgments, the Court had expressly treated the parliamentary process as failing to cure the earlier ministerial defect rather than as being a significant defect in its own right.

<<2975.39;2996.27;en>>
And in the two earlier July 2017 decisions at page 4 of document 16, it was expressly acknowledged by the claimants in those cases and by the Supreme Court that complaints at deficiencies in the minister's decision making did not invalidate the appointment of any of the 15 individuals appointed.

<<2996.27;3004.73;en>>
So a total of five separate Supreme Court decisions treated AE's appointment as valid and effective as a matter of law.

<<3004.73;3017.87;en>>
With the inevitable logical consequence that if the procedural defects identified had no implications or significance for AE, they could not do so for the applicant either.

<<3017.87;3025.14;en>>
That is, we say, an insurmountable obstacle for the applicant's case if subsidiarity is to be respected.

<<3025.14;3040.55;en>>
In addition, the remoteness of the relationship between the defects and the applicant's own case underscores the lack of merit in the applicant's arguments from the perspective of all relevant ECHR, EU and EFTA case law.

<<3040.55;3056.2;en>>
All of the Strasbourg case law shows that a central question will be whether the legal defect relied upon in any given case has any relevance to any of the substantive protections of fairness, independence and impartiality in that case.

<<3056.2;3068.29;en>>
As to the EU and EFTA case law, it concerned the conduct, of course, of EU and EFTA institutions and so in contrast to this case, no issue of subsidiarity arose.

<<3068.29;3085.35;en>>
It also dealt with a different context of cases where the legal defect went to the heart of issues of impartiality because it related to security of tenure, to mandate, to lack of qualification or because it involved deliberate breach of the applicable legal framework.

<<3085.35;3088.47;en>>
No such issues are in play here.

<<3088.47;3105.95;en>>
And finally, of course, the EU case law has now been described as manifestly wrongly decided by the Advocate General in the Simpson case where a far more nuanced approach is suggested and proper regard is given to the principle of legal certainty.

<<3105.95;3110.07;en>>
Mr. President, the government's second course of mission is that the applicant's complaint

<<3110.07;3118.75;en>>
is technical in the extreme and lacks any substantive merit, even if issues of subsidiarity are set to one side.

<<3118.75;3135.23;en>>
Aside from the fact that he pleaded guilty at first instance and now has no complaint whatever at the Court of Appeals' substantive approach in his case, his position becomes even less meritorious when one looks again at the nature of the procedural defects he relies upon.

<<3135.23;3149.83;en>>
The first defect in time concerned what the Supreme Court described as the absence of data indicating a sufficiently full comparative exercise by the Minister before her partial departure from the approach of the Evaluation Committee.

<<3149.83;3157.11;en>>
But that takes the applicant nowhere in seeking to establish that his appeal tribunal was not established by law.

<<3157.11;3162.66;en>>
First, the Constitution protects judges from removal from office once appointed.

<<3162.66;3171.35;en>>
That meant that as a matter of domestic law, the defect had no effect on the judicial powers or status of AE or her colleagues.

<<3171.35;3182.62;en>>
Second, the legal obligations AE owed to act in an impartial and independent manner further protected all parties from any risk of executive interference.

<<3182.62;3197.23;en>>
Third, there is, notwithstanding the submissions you just heard, no evidence here of bad faith on the Minister's part, and the factors she had regard to carried with them no suggestion whatever of executive interference.

<<3197.23;3202.91;en>>
Fourth, there is no suggestion that AE herself was to blame for what occurred.

<<3202.91;3219.73;en>>
And fifth, as documents 14 and 21 show, before the domestic courts, even the applicant acknowledged that AE could have been properly proposed by the Minister, even if all aspects of the procedure had been followed entirely correctly.

<<3219.73;3225.79;en>>
The second defect, relating to the collective vote held by Parliament, also goes nowhere.

<<3225.79;3229.83;en>>
First this was the first time the appointment process was being followed.

<<3229.83;3239.91;en>>
Second, as the Secretary General of Parliament confirmed to the President, collective votes were not unprecedented, and this one was considered lawful by the Secretariat.

<<3239.91;3243.87;en>>
Third all MPs were given the opportunity to seek individual voting.

<<3243.87;3245.79;en>>
None did.

<<3245.79;3258.03;en>>
Fourth there is no evidence whatever to support the applicant's extraordinary theory in his written submissions that this manner of voting was part of some kind of conspiracy to force through the appointment of AE.

<<3258.03;3269.87;en>>
On the contrary, the evidence is that had individual voting occurred, the result would have been the same, and that there were no objections to AE as an individual judge.

<<3269.87;3278.45;en>>
Before turning to the Government's third and final core submission, it's important to address the Chamber's flagrant breach test directly.

<<3278.45;3287.14;en>>
In the Chamber, the majority saw the determinative question in these proceedings as being whether there had been a flagrant breach of Icelandic law.

<<3287.14;3292.59;en>>
That was an approach for which there was no authority or adequate foundation.

<<3292.59;3318.33;en>>
The material question instead was that raised by the applicant himself at the domestic level at page 4 of his written submissions to the Supreme Court, document 21, whether, by virtue of the defects identified, AE's appointment was to be treated as a nullity, such that she was not the holder of judicial power and her acts were, in the applicant's own words, a dead letter.

<<3318.33;3330.79;en>>
If AE's appointment was a nullity, then when she came to sit on the applicant's appeal, she would not have been vested with judicial power at all, and the Court could not be said to be established by law.

<<3330.79;3336.87;en>>
If on the other hand, the appointment remained valid and effective, then the opposite conclusion would follow.

<<3336.87;3351.85;en>>
The Court, as an institution, had been established by law since January 2018, and all the judges sitting on the applicant's panel were judges formerly vested by law with judicial powers and obligations.

<<3351.85;3365.39;en>>
In every respect, therefore, the tribunal would be established by law, leaving questions as to fairness, impartiality, and independence to be considered by reference to those expressed terms in Article 6.

<<3365.39;3379.55;en>>
But even setting all of that to one side, if it were the right question to ask whether there had been a flagrant breach of domestic law, the answer would have to be that the breaches here were not flagrant.

<<3379.55;3384.19;en>>
First the conclusion of the domestic courts was to the opposite effect.

<<3384.19;3399.95;en>>
They described the defects as not significant and expressly left open the prospect that precisely the same outcome in terms of AE's appointment might have occurred had all procedures been correctly followed to the letter.

<<3399.95;3413.07;en>>
Second as the appointment process was unprecedented, any errors later identified were never likely to be easily characterized as flagrant unless bad faith could be shown.

<<3413.07;3425.62;en>>
Third the minister's criteria were transparent and objectively legitimate, gender equality judicial experience, even if the procedure for their deployment was later found to be flawed.

<<3425.62;3443.11;en>>
Fourth, a point entirely overlooked by the applicant, even in the earlier proceedings where the defects were eventually identified, the first instance district court had found no breach of the law, so further indicating that any error was less than flagrant.

<<3443.11;3457.7;en>>
And fifth, and I emphasize this, the domestic courts have made no finding at all of bad faith against the minister and they have made no finding at all of deliberate disregard of domestic law.

<<3457.7;3469.31;en>>
On the contrary, and as she explained to the domestic courts and she has emphasized in her statement of document 63, the minister took external expert advice in adopting the approach she did.

<<3469.31;3473.51;en>>
As to the issue of good faith, the grand chamber now also has the positive evidence of Mr.

<<3473.51;3476.62;en>>
Nielsen at document 64.

<<3476.62;3481.62;en>>
The allegations against the minister and Mr. Nielsen make no chronological sense and there

<<3481.62;3496.03;en>>
is a complete absence of material to support the applicant's other allegations against a very wide range of other persons and institutions he now criticizes as party to some form of conspiracy in his written submissions.

<<3496.03;3509.39;en>>
But the fact that none of those allegations were made at the domestic level also means that the principles of both exhaustion of domestic remedies and subsidiarity prevent them from being raised now.

<<3509.39;3514.47;en>>
The majority judgment does not engage with any of these points.

<<3514.47;3528.43;en>>
It addresses the question of flagrant breach at paragraphs 108 to 123, but most of those paragraphs do no more than recite the fact that there were defects of domestic law in the two respects mentioned.

<<3528.43;3534.55;en>>
That of course does not answer the question whether they are properly to be characterized as flagrant.

<<3534.55;3539.99;en>>
The majority instead rests the conclusion of flagrant breach on three points.

<<3539.99;3550.78;en>>
First what is said to be the receipt by the Minister of expert advice in emails sent to her and alleged findings about this by the Supreme Court in its December judgments.

<<3550.78;3559.57;en>>
Second the Minister's disregard for the danger to the reputation of the other candidates by reference to their exclusion from the nominees presented to Parliament.

<<3559.57;3568.55;en>>
And third the fact that the judicial appointment system was intended to limit the discretion of the executive and to require the participation of Parliament.

<<3568.55;3577.39;en>>
None of those three points can withstand scrutiny or begin to justify a finding of flagrant breach of the law in this case.

<<3577.39;3589.89;en>>
As to expert advice, the majority materially overstates the significance of the emails referred to and it makes a basic error of fact in its description of what the Supreme Court found.

<<3589.89;3602.39;en>>
The first email, document five, was five lines long and advocated only that the Minister include reference to the competence and career achievements of those she was proposing to include in her letter to Parliament.

<<3602.39;3606.2;en>>
That is something she did as document nine shows.

<<3606.2;3615.65;en>>
The second email, document six, contained no definitive legal advice at all and it did not contend that the Minister's proposed course was unlawful.

<<3615.65;3620.07;en>>
It simply flagged questions that might arise.

<<3620.07;3634.39;en>>
Additionally the majority also made the basic error of fact of stating that the Supreme Court judgments of December 2017 had made findings about these emails and that it somehow characterized them as expert advice.

<<3634.39;3641.66;en>>
Those judgments did not in fact refer to the emails at all as document 19 shows.

<<3641.66;3652.62;en>>
As to the danger to the reputation of other unsuccessful candidates, the majority takes the findings by the domestic courts out of context and it misunderstands them in consequence.

<<3652.62;3660.83;en>>
Those were findings relevant to whether damages should be awarded by reference to conventional questions of foreseeability and remoteness of loss.

<<3660.83;3670.16;en>>
They had no relationship at all to any question of deliberate breach of the law and I'm afraid they've been simply misdescribed in the submissions to the court.

<<3670.16;3687.12;en>>
On the contrary, at page 13 of document 19, the Supreme Court made it explicit that it was not finding that the Minister had deliberately set out to harm anyone's reputation and it made no finding at all of deliberate breach of the law.

<<3687.12;3706.41;en>>
And as to the third point relied upon by the chamber, the majority of the chamber, the question of limitations on the discretion of the executive and the requirement for parliamentary scrutiny, there is nothing on the facts here to suggest that anything that occurred went against that basic approach, let alone to a standard of flagrancy.

<<3706.41;3711.47;en>>
As a matter of law, the Minister was not bound by the views of the Evaluation Committee.

<<3711.47;3717.09;en>>
The Association of Judges had endorsed the relevance of the criteria that she applied.

<<3717.09;3732.23;en>>
Her additional nominees were all endorsed as eligible and qualified by the committee itself and all of the four candidates added, including AE, had more judicial experience than those four that the Minister replaced.

<<3732.23;3741.49;en>>
And it was clear that Parliament simply would not vote for the proposals of the committee without some amendment to achieve greater gender balance.

<<3741.49;3751.91;en>>
And finally, Parliament did then have the opportunity to scrutinise the Minister's proposals, both through the extensive discussion with the Constitutional Committee and in full session.

<<3751.91;3760.35;en>>
So even if flagrant breach of domestic law were the correct test to apply, it could never be satisfied on the facts of this case.

<<3760.35;3769.78;en>>
For a convention violation to be flagrant, as the Court is well aware, it must involve the complete destruction of the essence of the right.

<<3769.78;3772.43;en>>
That is simply not this case.

<<3772.43;3776.83;en>>
I turn finally then to the Government's third core submission of law.

<<3776.83;3787.07;en>>
It is that far from safeguarding the rule of law and the principle of judicial independence, the applicant's approach fundamentally weakens both concepts.

<<3787.07;3797.7;en>>
On the applicant's case, any clear defect in an appointment process, however historic in nature, can place the position of an individual judge in jeopardy.

<<3797.7;3817.47;en>>
Even where the process under scrutiny was novel, even where all concerned in the process have acted in good faith, even where the criteria applied are objectively reasonable ones, even where the judge themselves had no involvement whatever in any such defect, and even where the judge is manifestly qualified.

<<3817.47;3828.55;en>>
That approach is irreconcilable with the need for judicial security of tenure, both as a matter of basic principle and as reflected in Article 61 of the Constitution.

<<3828.55;3839.19;en>>
And it is striking, we say, that the majority judgment's reasoning contains no reference at all to this principle or to Article 61 of the Constitution.

<<3839.19;3843.16;en>>
But the serious policy issues go even further than this.

<<3843.16;3854.99;en>>
The rule of law also depends, of course, on legal certainty, and on parties and on society at large understanding that decisions made by courts are final in nature.

<<3854.99;3866.93;en>>
On the applicant's approach, there can never be such certainty, as at any point in time a defect in an appointment process might be identified and alleged to be flagrant.

<<3866.93;3886.43;en>>
That could lead not only to the effective removal from office of a judge who had done nothing wrong, but also to the invalidation of every decision that judge had participated in, and even potentially to every decision made by other judges appointed at the same time as part of the same process.

<<3886.43;3890.91;en>>
That would undermine the core values of the Convention and the rule of law.

<<3890.91;3907.15;en>>
And again, it is notable, as with the principle of judicial security of tenure, that the majority judgment fails even to refer to the principle of legal certainty, let alone to consider the implications of its reasoning for that principle.

<<3907.15;3912.66;en>>
It should also be emphasized, Mr. President, that this case could not be more different

<<3912.66;3917.15;en>>
from the kind of situation addressed by the interventions before the Court.

<<3917.15;3930.11;en>>
In contrast to the alleged situation in Poland or Georgia, the approach of the Icelandic authorities, as evidenced in the present case, poses no conceivable threat to judicial independence.

<<3930.11;3951.15;en>>
On the contrary, it supports that independence by insisting on judicial security of tenure, by insisting on proper constitutional protections for the status of judges, and by protecting judges from unmeritorious attacks on their status based upon technical errors for which others have been inadvertently responsible.

<<3951.15;3984.27;en>>
Now it may well be that in the future, whether in relation to Poland, Georgia, or another state, this Court will be called upon to assess the implications of judicial appointment processes or disciplinary measures, where questions of fairness, independence, and impartiality genuinely arise because, for example, of a lack of qualification on the part of those appointed, or because of a lack of adequate security of tenure, or because of clearly evidenced politicization of the process, or deliberate breaches of the law.

<<3984.27;3987.82;en>>
But that is emphatically not this case.

<<3987.82;3998.87;en>>
And in truth, the central principles of law set out in all of the four interventions before the Court are inconsistent with the approach of the majority judgment.

<<3998.87;4024.23;en>>
The core test that is proposed in the submissions of the government of Poland, the Helsinki Foundation, and the public defender of Georgia, is that a defect in appointment which all the circumstances of the case show to have adverse implications for impartiality and independence, or which affect the legal powers of the judge concerned, may lead to a finding of a violation of Article 6.

<<4024.23;4043.83;en>>
But if, as here, no such implications arise, and the defects are of a technical nature with no discernible impact on either outcome of appointment, judicial power or tenure, trial process, and no objective indication of politicized intent, then no violation should be found.

<<4043.83;4048.39;en>>
Mr. President, to accept the applicants' arguments would be, with respect, to bring the convention

<<4048.39;4062.59;en>>
system of oversight into disrepute, and it would, importantly, render the convention of far less value for those cases which may well arise in the future where the urgent intervention of the Court may be needed.

<<4062.59;4071.83;en>>
The endorsement of a test as general and vague as that contended for by the applicant would be dangerous enough as a matter of principle.

<<4071.83;4089.51;en>>
But a finding that it was satisfied in a case as technical as the applicants' would also create precisely the lack of legal certainty, and to use his words, the legal chaos that the Polish Commissioner for Human Rights warns against in his intervention.

<<4089.51;4098.86;en>>
It would be to open the Pandora's box described in the powerful dissenting opinion of Judge Lemons and Judge Gritko before the Chamber.

<<4098.86;4102.99;en>>
Mr. President, Members of the Court, for all those reasons and those set out in the detailed

<<4102.99;4105.91;en>>
written submissions, the Grand Chamber is invited to dismiss the applicants' complaints.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<4112.9;4114.9;en>>
Thank you for your submissions.

<<4114.9;4121.54;en>>
I now invite the judges of the Grand Chamber wishing to do so to put their questions to the parties.

<<4121.54;4121.54;en>>
Judge Pere Pastor Vilanova, please.

[[Judge;Pere Pastor Vilanova]]

<<4125.87;4127.27;fr>>
Merci beaucoup, M. le Président.

<<4128.07;4137.87;fr>>
J'ai trois questions à poser aux partis, une au gouvernement, une au requérant et, finalement, une troisième commune aux deux partis.

<<4139.31;4142.31;fr>>
La première, donc, est dirigée au gouvernement.

<<4143.99;4151.91;fr>>
Combien d'affaires similaires à celles du requérant sont actuellement pendantes devant les juridictions islandaises?

<<4151.91;4155.19;fr>>
Je vous demande un chiffre approximatif, bien entendu.

<<4158.67;4160.95;fr>>
Une question, donc, dirigée au requérant.

<<4162.83;4167.51;fr>>
Devant les juridictions nationales, le requérant a demandé à être rejugé.

<<4168.99;4173.11;fr>>
Il me semble que cette prétention n'a pas été formulée devant la Chambre.

<<4174.51;4190.99;fr>>
Par conséquent, je voudrais savoir si le requérant demande à la Grande Chambre à être rejugé en Islande, en plus, bien entendu, de la réparation pécuniaire de 5 000 euros qu'il formule au titre de l'article 41 de la Convention.

<<4192.71;4197.03;fr>>
Et enfin, une dernière question commune aux deux partis.

<<4198.83;4209.59;fr>>
À l'époque des faits de l'espèce, quels étaient les liens entre la ministre de la Justice, Mme Andersen, la police et les procureurs?

<<4209.59;4211.55;fr>>
Je vous remercie, M. le Président.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<4216.07;4218.88;fr>>
Merci beaucoup, le juge Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque.

[[Judge;Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque]]

<<4220.72;4227.84;en>>
Thank you, President. I have three questions. One for the applicant, one for the government,

<<4227.84;4235.64;en>>
and the third one for both parties. Now, the applicant accuses the Minister of Justice

<<4235.64;4249.88;en>>
of this most abject, backstage, horse-trading deal between members of the same party. There

<<4249.88;4278.12;en>>
would have been a deal between the former Minister of Justice and candidate BN to Reykjavik, according to which Judge AE, who is the wife of BN, would go to the Court of Appeal if BN would step down in favor of the Minister. So there is, in your view, clear quid pro

<<4278.12;4286.24;en>>
quo, a deal, and personal political gain of the former Minister of Justice. And you even

<<4286.24;4294.4;en>>
said that there is bad faith bordering intent. My question is, was there any criminal investigation

<<4294.4;4317.44;en>>
or prosecution launched against the former Minister of Justice on this basis, alleged abuse of power or corruption? You have mentioned the deficiencies of the Supreme Court's oversight

<<4317.44;4324.08;en>>
over this entire procedure. You have pointed out the fact that the Supreme Court did not

<<4324.08;4334.04;en>>
address this argument in its judgment of May 2018. The Supreme Court said there was no

<<4334.04;4351.86;en>>
nullity, no major defect in the appointment procedure, confirming its judgment of December 2017. My question is the following. Is it your view that the Supreme Court should have

<<4351.86;4363.12;en>>
annulled the Minister's decision in its judgment of December 2017? I would like to recall the

<<4363.12;4375.32;en>>
passage of the Supreme Court's decision with regard to the request of annulment of the Minister's decision. The Supreme Court said the following, and I'm quoting the Supreme

<<4375.32;4386.58;en>>
Court, it is not in the power of the courts to decide who should be appointed to the office of judge of the Court of Appeal. Bearing this in mind and having received the appellant's

<<4386.58;4404.84;en>>
explanation as to the nature of their claim, which will serve as a basis here, the appellants have not demonstrated that they have a lawful interest in obtaining a court ruling on the invalidity of decisions by the Minister of Justice. This is the decision of the Supreme

<<4404.84;4421.32;en>>
Court upholding the district court's judgments insofar as they concern the request of annulment of the Minister's decision. Is it your position that this is wrong in law and the Supreme

<<4421.32;4441.44;en>>
Court did not exercise full jurisdiction over the Minister's decision and should have done so? With regard to the government, after the delivery of the chamber judgment, the Minister

<<4441.44;4449.76;en>>
of Justice resigned from office. Why so? If the judgment of the chamber is wrong, there

<<4449.76;4460.92;en>>
is no reason to resign. The only reason to resign is if the judgment of the chamber is

<<4460.92;4468.46;en>>
right. But then the question might be raised, why is the government appealing the decision

<<4468.46;4477.28;en>>
of the chamber if it is right? Final question addressed to both parties. In the criminal

<<4477.28;4494.88;en>>
proceedings against the applicant, the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's motion for AE to withdraw from his case. But it decided so with the participation of AE. AE intervened

<<4494.88;4508.02;en>>
in the judgment itself where the impartiality was at stake. Would you comment on this? Thank

<<4508.02;4508.02;en>>
you very much.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<4511.47;4514.39;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge Georges Ravarani.

[[Judge;Georges Ravarani]]

<<4516.53;4517.97;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4517.97;4520.53;en>>
I have a legal question to both parties.

<<4520.53;4528.29;en>>
It's true that during their pleadings they touched upon it indirectly, but I think for the sake of clarity I will ask it again.

<<4528.29;4540.85;en>>
Do you think that the requirements for a fair hearing, establishment by law, independence, and impartiality are self-standing requirements or if they are interrelated?

<<4540.85;4546.05;en>>
And if interrelated, is there a hierarchy between them?

<<4546.05;4546.61;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<4550.32;4551.68;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge Jon Fridrik Kjølbro.

[[Judge;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<4555.57;4556.67;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4556.67;4562.03;en>>
I do have one question, which at the same time is addressed to both parties.

<<4562.03;4580.49;en>>
And the question is concerned the link between a possible finding of a violation of Article VI established by law and the possible consequences to be drawn from such a finding, meaning the link between Article VI and Article 46 of the convention.

<<4580.49;4587.87;en>>
The applicant is arguing that there has been a violation of Article VI and that there has to be a reopening.

<<4587.87;4595.95;en>>
The government, on the other hand, is arguing there has been no violation of Article VI and obviously no need to reopen.

<<4595.95;4598.63;en>>
My question is more in general.

<<4598.63;4615.29;en>>
To what extent, and could the parties elaborate on, to what extent will a finding of a violation of Article VI necessitate a reopening or whether it would necessitate the court to indicate reopening?

<<4615.29;4622.11;en>>
Or in other words, which kinds of violations of Article VI would necessitate the reopening?

<<4622.11;4640.51;en>>
Is the threshold under Article VI, the threshold for finding a violation of Article VI established by law, is it necessarily the same threshold which the court should apply under Article 46 when deciding whether or not to indicate as an individual measure the reopening of the procedures?

<<4640.51;4644.71;en>>
So if both parties could clarify their view on that question.

<<4644.71;4644.71;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<4646.64;4647.64;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4647.64;4649.08;en>>
Judge, Síofra O’Leary, please.

[[Judge;Síofra O’Leary]]

<<4651.68;4653.4;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<4653.4;4655.32;en>>
I have three questions.

<<4655.32;4664.12;en>>
I'd like to follow up and repeat the question asked by my colleague, Judge Ravarani, concerning the interrelationship in Article 6.1

<<4664.12;4671.68;en>>
fair trial assessments by this court of the criteria related to establishment by law, independence, and impartiality.

<<4671.68;4681.16;en>>
And I repeat the question not for the sake of it, but rather to leave both parties in no doubt that the bench wants an answer to this question.

<<4681.16;4687.04;en>>
My second question is also addressed to both parties, but particularly to the applicant.

<<4687.04;4700.68;en>>
Both parties have examined in detail and in general terms questions relating to the irregularities recognized by the Icelandic Supreme Court in the appointment of court of appeal judges.

<<4700.68;4707.16;en>>
But I'd like to ask both parties to return their focus to the applicant's individual case.

<<4707.16;4715.28;en>>
The respondent government addressed this in their submissions, but in my view, the applicant could address it a little bit more.

<<4715.28;4723.12;en>>
According to the constant case law of this court, our primary concern in examining an Article 6.1 complaint

<<4723.12;4729.36;en>>
is, and I quote, to evaluate the overall fairness of the applicant's criminal proceedings.

<<4729.36;4747.08;en>>
So could both parties please tell us or repeat how the criminal proceedings involving the applicant heard at district court level, at which stage the applicant pleaded guilty, heard on appeal by the court of appeal, and then again at Supreme Court level.

<<4747.08;4756.56;en>>
In what way were these proceedings unfair due to the irregular appointment of four out of 15 court of appeal judges?

<<4756.56;4764.84;en>>
And of course, here I'm asking you not just to address questions as of consequence, but rather questions of cause and effect.

<<4764.84;4781.48;en>>
And my third question is a follow-on question from Judge Pinto de Albuquerque, and I apologize to him in advance if I've misunderstood his question, and I apologize in particular to both parties if I misunderstand Icelandic law, but I'm not an Icelandic judge.

<<4781.48;4791.8;en>>
And the question relates to Judge Pinto de Albuquerque's question about the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to annul the ministerial decision.

<<4791.8;4806.4;en>>
Now, what I haven't understood is whether he is referring to the Supreme Court decisions in the damages cases brought by the candidates whose names had been removed from the list, or to the Supreme Court judgment in the applicant's case.

<<4806.4;4818.64;en>>
But in either or both cases under Icelandic law, did the Supreme Court have any jurisdiction whatsoever in the context of those proceedings to annul the ministerial decision?

<<4818.64;4838.92;en>>
And particularly, did the Supreme Court have jurisdiction to act in that way in the context of the applicant's case, which was, of course, an appeal from the Court of Appeal and on from the District Court concerning the commission of traffic offenses driving under the influence of narcotics and without a license?

<<4838.92;4838.92;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<4842.57;4843.93;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4843.93;4845.57;en>>
Judge Egidijus Kūris, please.

[[Judge;Egidijus Kūris]]

<<4848.09;4849.73;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4849.73;4860.73;en>>
I have some factual questions, first of all, to the representatives of the government, but I invite also the representative of the applicant to comment if he wishes so.

<<4860.73;4869.69;en>>
My first question refers to the 15 candidates on their lists as amended by the minister, as exchanged by the minister.

<<4869.69;4883.13;en>>
We see that in that list, we had candidates number 7, 11, 12, and 14 removed and replaced by candidates numbers 17, 18, 23, and the 30th.

<<4883.13;4885.13;en>>
I would like to understand the criteria.

<<4885.13;4886.53;en>>
Why these numbers?

<<4886.53;4894.25;en>>
Why wasn't it the 12, the 13, the 14, and the 15, and then the 16, 17, and so on?

<<4894.25;4912.45;en>>
Was there any logic in that, especially in the light of, my question is in the light of the applicant's representative remark that a female judge, who was numbered 22, was not selected to the new composition, and she was not selected to the new composition.

<<4912.45;4916.01;en>>
But a female judge, who was number 30, was selected.

<<4916.01;4917.13;en>>
So was there any logic?

<<4917.13;4926.89;en>>
Were there any objective criteria or justifiable criteria which the minister employed when changing the list of candidates?

<<4926.89;4928.39;en>>
That's my one question.

<<4928.39;4931.17;en>>
My other question relates to the statement of facts.

<<4931.17;4944.29;en>>
And in the statement of facts, we have a letter of the chairman of the evaluation committee who provided that letter to the Minister of Justice on the 28th of May, 2017.

<<4944.29;4954.17;en>>
That is one day before the amended or modified list of candidates was presented to the parliament on the eve of that presentation.

<<4954.17;4971.17;en>>
And in that letter, the chairman of the committee, of the evaluation committee, objected to the changing of weightings and, by extension, to the recomposition of the group of candidates which was already in place.

<<4971.17;4987.21;en>>
And I just quote that, according to the chairman, changing the weightings after the composition of the group of candidates for the benefit of particular candidates and to the disadvantage of others had to be avoided.

<<4987.21;4992.29;en>>
I put emphasis on the word particular, benefit of particular candidates.

<<4992.29;4999.57;en>>
Could you please shed some light on what was meant by the word particular candidates?

<<4999.57;5003.93;en>>
The chairman of the committee used plural.

<<5003.93;5007.45;en>>
What was meant by particular candidates?

<<5007.45;5016.57;en>>
Or at least what the minister from that letter could understand or ought to have understood by the word particular?

<<5016.57;5020.65;en>>
And my third question, also a factual question, will be very straightforward.

<<5020.65;5031.13;en>>
And that was partly prompted by Judge Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque's question about this alleged swap of services or horse trading.

<<5031.13;5034.61;en>>
He used the term horse trading.

<<5034.61;5052.21;en>>
The chairman of the parliamentary committee giving his place on the party's constituency list to the minister just not long after the nomination of an appointment of his wife to that judicial position.

<<5052.21;5055.53;en>>
My question would be very straightforward, maybe unusually straightforward.

<<5055.53;5064.93;en>>
But could you please tell whether that was a coincidence, a lack of judgment, or a quid pro quo?

<<5064.93;5065.81;en>>
Plainly, thank you.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<5068.7;5069.82;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<5069.82;5070.82;en>>
Judge Turković, please.

[[Judge;Ksenija Turković]]

<<5073.07;5074.15;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<5074.15;5082.51;en>>
I would just like to expand a little bit on the question that was asked by Judge Kjølbro.

<<5082.51;5091.31;en>>
And this is the relationship between Article 6 and finding a violation and the consequences.

<<5091.31;5100.71;en>>
And not just the reopening, because it seems to me that we have something intermediary, and this is annulment of the judgment.

<<5100.71;5107.33;en>>
So are you pleading for the automatic annulment of the judgment?

<<5107.33;5118.19;en>>
Or there could be instances where automatic and under which conditions automatic annulment then would not be required.

<<5118.19;5125.75;en>>
And what is then the consequence of that for the reopening?

<<5125.75;5134.51;en>>
In other words, could reopening be mandated by the court?

<<5134.51;5146.25;en>>
And or at the domestic level, could reopening be requested not only by the applicant, but by the government?

<<5146.25;5154.03;en>>
Because in a case like this, the applicant might not have an incentive to ask for the reopening.

<<5154.03;5166.43;en>>
At the domestic level, annulment of the judgment, how it is connected to "ne bis in idem", and how it is connected to statute of limitation.

<<5166.43;5175.83;en>>
Would in this particular case statute of limitation be there if the judgment would be annulled?

<<5175.83;5175.83;en>>
Thank you.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<5563.52;5566.48;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<5566.48;5577.28;en>>
to start with, I would like to ask for the court's permission to answer all its questions in writing, as allowed under the rules of the court.

<<5577.28;5592.32;en>>
Regarding the answers to the government's speech, I would like to start with the alleged changes in the opinions of the evaluation committee.

<<5592.32;5611.76;en>>
On behalf of the Icelandic state, it has been argued that the evaluation committee on judicial appointments has, after the facts of this case occurred, based its evaluation of judicial candidates on different grounds than it applied in the present case.

<<5611.76;5624.36;en>>
Reference has been made in this respect to the committee's opinion of 9 December 2019 in the appointment process for a vacant Supreme Court position.

<<5624.36;5645.76;en>>
This argument must be understood to allege that, by this, the committee's evaluation methods in the present case and its conclusions have been stricken down, and consequently that the Minister of Justice should be seen as justified in proposing her own list of candidates.

<<5645.76;5652.4;en>>
In the view of the applicant, this claim is completely without merit.

<<5652.4;5668.36;en>>
The law changes in 2010 limited the influence of the Minister of Justice in the appointment process and instead placed the authority mainly in the hands of a professional evaluation committee.

<<5668.36;5681.04;en>>
In the opinion of the special evaluation committee on 9 December 2019, the conclusion was reached that three of the candidates were deemed most qualified.

<<5681.04;5689.5;en>>
The evaluation committee found those three most qualified of the candidates and all equally qualified for the post.

<<5689.5;5714.18;en>>
In this respect, it must be stressed that in both evaluations, the one for the appeal court in 2017, that this case concerns, and in this recent one, in December 2019, for the Supreme Court, the committee acted completely in accordance with relevant Icelandic law and rules on its work.

<<5714.18;5719.72;en>>
In both cases, it was also anonymous in its findings.

<<5719.72;5738.48;en>>
It is therefore hard to see how a differently based evaluation by the committee in an entirely different appointment process with entirely different circumstances can be said to have any meaning for the present case.

<<5738.48;5741.52;en>>
Here the applicant stresses the following.

<<5741.52;5760.64;en>>
Just for argument's sake, even if any criticism could be aimed at the evaluation committee on the grounds of compulsion of those two evaluations, that would be an entirely separate matter from the core facts and issues of the present case.

<<5760.64;5776.08;en>>
It could firstly on no account make less significant, let alone justify, the former Minister of Justice's own flagrant violations in the appeal court appointment process of spring 2017.

<<5776.08;5786.64;en>>
And secondly, the same would naturally apply for the serious violations by Parliament in the same process.

<<5786.64;5798.8;en>>
I will now turn to the consequences of the chamber judgment for the member states or the opening of the so-called Pantherus box.

<<5798.8;5823.0;en>>
In my arguments today, I have discussed that the established by law principle of Article 6, paragraph 1, is not only a formal condition for the legality of a tribunal, probably more importantly, it also represents a material requirement fully applicable to the process of judicial appointments.

<<5823.0;5833.0;en>>
Now, what if this provision was to be interpreted as only having this formal dimension and therefore no material requirements?

<<5833.0;5836.48;en>>
What would happen then?

<<5836.48;5844.78;en>>
In the applicant's view, it is very likely that such a conclusion could have a grave and disturbing consequences.

<<5844.78;5858.44;en>>
Namely, as recent events in Europe show, some states have taken deliberate action to harm the independence and impartiality of their justice system.

<<5858.44;5873.84;en>>
A conclusion to interpret this principle strictly formally would afford such states opportunity to operate and cause lasting harm to human rights in those states.

<<5873.84;5883.48;en>>
In this context, some well-known examples can be pointed out from Poland, Turkey, and now Iceland.

<<5883.48;5890.44;en>>
It must be stressed again, therefore this case carries great importance in this respect.

<<5890.44;5903.88;en>>
With reference to arguments made today on behalf of the Icelandic state, there is also reason to address what consequences it could possibly have if the Chamber judgment would be upheld.

<<5903.88;5915.68;en>>
The consequence will simply be that the Member State will be forced to follow and uphold their own legislation on the judicial system.

<<5915.68;5920.68;en>>
The applicant can find no fault with that consequence.

<<5920.68;5926.98;en>>
He also finds it hard to understand why anyone else could.

<<5926.98;5930.5;en>>
The only thing that will happen are good things.

<<5930.5;5940.16;en>>
Justice will be served here today, and justice will hopefully prevail elsewhere in the future.

<<5940.16;5940.16;en>>
Mr President, members of the court, the applicant rests.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<5947.94;5949.94;en>>
I call now Mrs. Þorsteinsdóttir.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<5953.39;5958.43;en>>
Mr. President, with your leave, I'll take the floor first.

<<5958.43;5960.95;en>>
Mr. President, some very brief reply submissions

<<5960.95;5965.45;en>>
on the law and the facts, as contended for by the applicant first.

<<5965.45;5968.83;en>>
And then I'll endeavor to answer the court's questions.

<<5968.83;5974.25;en>>
If the applicant is given permission to answer in writing, we would also seek the same indulgence.

<<5974.25;5978.39;en>>
But I'll seek to answer the questions as best I can now.

<<5978.39;5980.99;en>>
So reply submissions first, the law.

<<5980.99;6029.31;en>>
It is striking, we say, that the applicant has failed to engage with any of the case law cited by the grand chamber's questions to the parties, all of which, and this goes to one of the questions raised by both Judge Ravarani and Judge O'Leary, all of which, properly understood, supports the government's position by emphasizing the importance of a relationship of proximity between any legal defect identified and the applicant's individual case, and by making it clear that technical defects with no implications for independence or impartiality or fairness cannot provide the foundation for a finding of a violation of Article VI under any of its terms.

<<6029.31;6037.75;en>>
So far as the law is concerned, the applicant has also referred again, as he did in his January submissions, to the Simpson case.

<<6037.75;6046.47;en>>
As I've said, correctly understood, the opinion of Advocate General Sharpstone fundamentally weakens the applicant's case.

<<6046.47;6070.41;en>>
At paragraph 47, 57, and 58, it criticizes the earlier general court case of FV, heavily relied upon by the applicant before the majority, and suggests it is wrongly decided and it has fundamentally failed to have regard to the critical requirements of legal certainty, even failing to mention the concept.

<<6070.41;6076.27;en>>
Precisely the same criticism can, with respect, be made of the majority judgment of the chamber here.

<<6076.27;6083.71;en>>
Its reasoning, too, contains no reference at all to that doctrine or to judicial security of tenure.

<<6083.71;6102.95;en>>
Paragraph 65 and 85 of Advocate General Sharpton's opinion state in terms that even a deliberate breach of domestic rules on the appointment of a judge, as occurred in FV's case, will not suffice for a finding that the tribunal is not established by law.

<<6102.95;6120.73;en>>
Paragraphs 98 to 104 identify a far more nuanced approach evident from the domestic case law of the Czech Republic, of France, of Germany, of Spain, and the United Kingdom, all of it showing the fundamental importance of legal certainty.

<<6120.73;6153.59;en>>
The one example of a breach of an appointment procedure that Advocate General Sharpton identifies as justifying a conclusion that a tribunal is not established by law is that set out at paragraph 107 of her opinion, where a procedure has been deliberately manipulated by political leaders in order to secure the appointment, as a judge, of a supporter of theirs who does not have any legal qualification required, but who could be relied upon to sentence government opponents to life imprisonment.

<<6153.59;6160.47;en>>
Those are the words of Advocate General Sharpton as to the kind of scenario where a finding of not established by law could be justified.

<<6160.47;6165.47;en>>
It is quite obviously a million miles from this case.

<<6165.47;6172.67;en>>
Before leaving Simpson, I should emphasize that it also proceeds on the basis of a flawed understanding of the facts of this case.

<<6172.67;6177.27;en>>
It wrongly understood the evidence in this case to show a deliberate breach of the law.

<<6177.27;6179.01;en>>
The evidence does not show that.

<<6179.01;6181.63;en>>
The domestic judgments have not found that.

<<6181.63;6206.75;en>>
And it wrongly overlooked the significance of the voting in Parliament being the same, whether it was collective or individual, the voting in Parliament not being strictly on party lines, but involving votes for, against, and abstentions, the independent advice of the Secretariat to Parliament as to the lawfulness of what occurred, and the unprecedented nature of the process.

<<6206.75;6212.37;en>>
Turning to what the applicant said about the facts, Mr. President, I apologize for repeating this,

<<6212.37;6215.15;en>>
but it could not be more important.

<<6215.15;6222.15;en>>
There is nothing in the domestic judgments in this case to show a deliberate disregard of the law.

<<6222.15;6229.51;en>>
It is simply a mischaracterization of the debate before the domestic courts and the findings of the domestic courts to suggest otherwise.

<<6229.51;6239.77;en>>
And it is quite wrong for that submission to be repeated.

<<6239.77;6250.59;en>>
Turning, if I may, then, to attempt to engage with the court's questions, the first question came, Mr. President, from —

<<6250.59;6253.71;en>>
first questions came from Judge Villanova.

<<6253.71;6259.23;en>>
And the question was, what is the number of similar cases pending in Iceland?

<<6259.23;6272.59;en>>
It's not possible today to give a definitive answer to that question, but it clearly goes to the potential implications in terms of legal certainty of the Chamber's judgment.

<<6272.59;6299.13;en>>
The potential implications would extend to every decision taken by AE or her colleagues between January 2018 and March 2019, when, in response to the Chamber judgment, the decision was taken that AE and the three additional colleagues appointed with her, not proposed first time round by the Evaluation Committee, should no longer sit on the Court of Appeal.

<<6299.13;6311.29;en>>
So every decision taken in that 15-month period involving those judges would be susceptible to challenge if the applicants' complaints are right.

<<6311.29;6323.19;en>>
The second question for us, I think, from Judge Villanova was — or for both parties, rather — was, what were the links between the minister and the police and the prosecution?

<<6323.19;6334.05;en>>
And we understand this question, again, to go to a recurring theme in the Court's questions about whether the applicant here really has any substantive complaint of unfairness.

<<6334.05;6339.07;en>>
And the answer to that question is, he has no substantive complaint as to unfairness.

<<6339.07;6346.91;en>>
The Constitution in Iceland is quite clear that the police and the prosecution are obliged to act independently.

<<6346.91;6374.75;en>>
And there is no question here of whatever defects the minister was responsible for, tainting the independent judgment of the police and the prosecution and tainting the substance of the allegations against this applicant, who, after all, was, as the evidence shows, a repeat offender who pleaded guilty at the district court and has no substantive complaint at the way the Court of Appeal actually handled his case.

<<6374.75;6389.79;en>>
Turning then to Judge Pinto's questions, the first question, I think, was whether there had been any criminal investigation into the minister's conduct, given the way the applicant now put his case before this court.

<<6389.79;6397.51;en>>
There has been no investigation, and there has been no criminal complaint, whether by the applicant or his lawyer or otherwise.

<<6397.51;6405.95;en>>
And this again goes to a recurring question in some of the court's questions.

<<6405.95;6408.67;en>>
There was no quid pro quo here.

<<6408.67;6414.91;en>>
The applicant's case is littered with unevidenced conspiracy theory.

<<6414.91;6422.95;en>>
Documents 63 and 64, in particular, the statements before the Grand Chamber from the former minister and from Mr. Nielsen,

<<6422.95;6432.75;en>>
who are said to be at the heart of this somewhat outlandish conspiracy theory, explaining why the applicant's allegations make no chronological sense whatever.

<<6432.75;6445.41;en>>
The theory of the applicant's case was that in May 2017, there was some horse trading, some backstairs deal, that there will be a resignation to allow the minister to stand in a particular way at the election.

<<6445.41;6451.15;en>>
In May 2017, the next election scheduled was for 2020.

<<6451.15;6460.15;en>>
It just so happened that as events would unfold in Iceland, an entirely different course was taken, and by the autumn, elections were being held.

<<6460.15;6466.63;en>>
But that was neither anticipated nor capable of being anticipated at the material time in May 2017.

<<6466.63;6480.91;en>>
And that chronological sequence, striking at the centerpiece of the entire conspiracy theory advanced by the applicant, we respectfully submit is compelling.

<<6480.91;6502.15;en>>
There's the further point that this direct allegation of actual bad faith, both against the former minister and embracing in the written submissions the entirety of the Supreme Court, the entirety of Parliament, the Speaker of Parliament, the Secretariat of Parliament, none of it appeared in the submissions before the domestic courts.

<<6502.15;6510.99;en>>
And it will be an extraordinary step, we say, for the applicant to be allowed to maintain unevidenced allegations of that kind now.

<<6510.99;6518.55;en>>
The second question raised by Judge Pinto went to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, which was also raised by Judge O'Leary.

<<6518.55;6522.11;en>>
And I'll come back to that, if I may, when dealing with her questions.

<<6522.11;6526.27;en>>
Judge Pinto's third question was, why did the minister resign?

<<6526.27;6533.87;en>>
If the chamber judgment was wrong, as the government now says, then there was no reason for her to resign.

<<6533.87;6535.67;en>>
The minister has actually given specific...

<<6535.67;6540.61;en>>
The former minister has actually given specific instructions on that point.

<<6540.61;6556.03;en>>
She resigned because she felt it appropriate that any decision as to whether or not to refer the chamber's judgment to the Grand Chamber should be taken and be seen to be taken completely independently.

<<6556.03;6563.59;en>>
And that it could never be said that the decision to seek a referral to the Grand Chamber was to serve the personal interest of the minister.

<<6563.59;6571.23;en>>
Her resignation carried with it no acceptance, whatever, that the outcome with respect of the chamber judgment was correct.

<<6571.23;6577.75;en>>
And that's abundantly clear from her statement now before the Grand Chamber at Document 63.

<<6577.75;6579.67;en>>
That is, in fact, what happened.

<<6579.67;6587.39;en>>
An independent decision was then taken by the government of Iceland to seek a referral for precisely the reasons we have been submitting today.

<<6587.39;6595.99;en>>
With great respect, we submit that the chamber judgment and the applicant's case does serious damage to the rule of law, not just in Iceland, but elsewhere.

<<6595.99;6609.95;en>>
And the importance of the principles of legal certainty and judicial security of tenure hardly needs to be stressed.

<<6609.95;6618.51;en>>
Judge Pinto's final question was to ask whether, as I understood it, whether there was anything irregular or inappropriate in Judge A.E.

<<6618.51;6624.35;en>>
participating in the decision on the recusal application in the applicant's case.

<<6624.35;6627.63;en>>
The answer is there is nothing inappropriate in that course.

<<6627.63;6651.49;en>>
It is entirely conventional right across the Council of Europe where recusal applications are available for that recusal application to be made to the judge himself or herself, and for the judge himself or herself to make that decision, subject, of course, to the supervisory oversight of an appellate court, as was available in this case the Supreme Court.

<<6651.49;6657.31;en>>
So nothing inappropriate at all, and entirely correct that she did so.

<<6657.31;6673.43;en>>
And on the facts here, the question in any recusal application is, do the objective facts here suggest that there is, to the objective bystander, any reason to doubt the independence and impartiality of the judge who is about to decide upon the case?

<<6673.43;6691.37;en>>
And for all the reasons I emphasized in my opening submissions relating to her preeminent qualifications, her distinguished record as a judge, her exemplary record since appointment, there is no basis upon which an objective bystander could have reached that conclusion.

<<6691.37;6712.99;en>>
Judge Ravarani, in a question also raised by Judge O'Leary, raised an important question of legal principle as to the interrelationship between the requirement in Article VI for a tribunal to be established by law and the discrete wording relating to fairness, independence, and impartiality.

<<6712.99;6727.35;en>>
And this is, to some extent, as I said earlier, a matter I already commented upon in my reply submissions to the applicant's case and to his failure to engage with the Strasbourg case law.

<<6727.35;6732.75;en>>
The concepts are, to some extent, interrelated.

<<6732.75;6735.43;en>>
The overall target is clear.

<<6735.43;6738.79;en>>
Individuals' rights are to be protected in a fair manner.

<<6738.79;6740.27;en>>
That's what matters.

<<6740.27;6743.83;en>>
That's what's at the core of Article VI.

<<6743.83;6763.99;en>>
And if you have a technical defect which shows, strictly speaking, as in this case, that there has been a departure from some provision of Icelandic law, it cannot be the case that that is sufficient on its own to show that the tribunal is not established by law or that the judge is not bested with legal powers.

<<6763.99;6768.35;en>>
There has to be a common sense application of the context.

<<6768.35;6783.83;en>>
And a common sense application of the context requires consideration of what implications that legal defect actually has in the particular case for the independence, impartiality, and fairness of the process faced by the individual.

<<6783.83;6789.31;en>>
And on the facts here, there are no such implications.

<<6789.31;6812.75;en>>
Now, different, of course, in a situation of the kind alleged in relation to Poland and Georgia in the interventions, you might have a situation where, as a matter of black letter law, there could be no complaint about the domestic law which had established a court and no complaint about the domestic law which had led to a particular judge being put in position.

<<6812.75;6832.91;en>>
But if the evidence and all the circumstances of the case showed that the law had been explicitly manipulated for political partisan purposes, then that might well lead to a finding, both that there had been a lack of independence and impartiality and that there had been a failure to have a court established by law.

<<6832.91;6834.95;en>>
So they do interrelate.

<<6834.95;6841.19;en>>
And once one understands that interrelationship and looks at the substance, it only leads to the conclusion that the applicant's case fails.

<<6844.21;6858.39;en>>
Judge Kelbro asked what kind of violation of Article VI could lead to a reopening of the case having regard to Article 46 of the Convention.

<<6858.39;6871.67;en>>
And this question about the consequences of the chamber judgment embraces both the Strasbourg level of Article VI and Article 46, of course, and the domestic level of what are the implications of a finding for the Icelandic courts.

<<6871.67;6876.95;en>>
As I understood it, Judge Kelbro was focusing on the first of those.

<<6876.95;6910.51;en>>
There is case law, as the court will know, particularly emanating originally from Turkey, which showed that where there was a finding of a violation of the impartiality requirement, because, for example, of the presence of a military judge on courts trying conventional criminal proceedings involving the PKK and others, where there was that problem of objective partiality, then the court has stated, in principle, that would justify a reopening of the case.

<<6910.51;6923.63;en>>
It's never said that a finding of a technical defect in some aspect of domestic law could, in principle, justify that reopening.

<<6923.63;6929.39;en>>
But the important point to emphasize here is that is what the applicant here is after.

<<6929.39;6934.09;en>>
That is what the applicant will be contending before the Icelandic courts.

<<6934.09;6947.85;en>>
And it is that which gives rise to the fundamental problems of legal certainty, or legal uncertainty, or legal chaos, as the Polish Commissioner for Human Rights would have it, that I've been emphasizing.

<<6947.85;6958.03;en>>
Turning then to Judge O'Leary's questions, the first related to the interrelationship of the terms within Article VI, established by law, fairness, independence, impartiality.

<<6958.03;6960.47;en>>
And I've attempted to give my answer to that question.

<<6960.47;6972.23;en>>
Judge O'Leary also focused expressly on, in a question directed, it should be said principally, to the applicant, on the implications for the applicant's own case.

<<6972.23;6975.79;en>>
We do, with respect, emphasize that point for our own part.

<<6975.79;6977.63;en>>
There are no implications here.

<<6977.63;6983.71;en>>
And it will be quite wrong for his case to lead to a finding of a violation.

<<6983.71;6997.55;en>>
And then the third question, which I think picked up on one of Judge Pinto's questions, related to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in Iceland, in terms of an annulment of the decision of the minister.

<<6997.55;7005.31;en>>
Now, that's a matter we've addressed at paragraph 123 of our written submissions.

<<7005.31;7016.31;en>>
To annul the decision of the minister would require separate proceedings, which the courts in Iceland would have jurisdiction over, just not within the applicant's own case.

<<7016.31;7020.63;en>>
But the point I emphasize here is that safeguard is there.

<<7020.63;7034.27;en>>
And not a single candidate of the disappointed candidates has ever contended that invalidation of the minister's decision to invalidate the successful candidate's appointment should occur.

<<7035.55;7038.23;en>>
So two important points to emphasize.

<<7038.23;7041.03;en>>
The jurisdiction is there to protect the rule of law.

<<7041.03;7045.47;en>>
And no one has ever suggested there's anything wrong with these judges' approach.

<<7045.47;7049.79;en>>
With these judges' appointments as a matter of substance.

<<7049.79;7053.79;en>>
Judge Kouris asked a number of questions.

<<7053.79;7060.99;en>>
On the facts, the question was, well, what was the logic and criteria of the selection of the judges?

<<7060.99;7076.11;en>>
Well, the logic and criteria was as explained in our written submissions, paragraph 18, as evidenced from the documents, in particular document 63, 43, and document F, as well as documents 24 and the others that we've referred to.

<<7076.11;7085.63;en>>
The criteria were to better reflect gender balance and to give greater weight to judicial experience.

<<7085.63;7102.43;en>>
Now on the back of that, Judge Kouris asked a question specifically about how it was that a male judge, Judge 30, had been appointed in preference or above a female judge, I think it was Judge 22, given the gender balance point.

<<7102.43;7116.55;en>>
Well, as documents 43 and document F show, Judge 30 scored significantly higher than Judge 22 in terms of judicial experience, even on the evaluation committee's analysis.

<<7116.55;7118.83;en>>
The score Judge 30 had was 9.5,

<<7118.83;7122.39;en>>
the score Judge 22 had was 6.5.

<<7122.39;7130.55;en>>
Now, right or wrong, and the fact that we're here suggests there are different views on this, those were the judges appointed.

<<7130.55;7137.39;en>>
What this answer illustrates, with great respect, is that there's no question whatever here of bad faith.

<<7137.39;7142.55;en>>
The courts have found that something went wrong, but there's no question here of bad faith.

<<7142.55;7145.95;en>>
Two objectively reasonable criteria were applied.

<<7145.95;7154.91;en>>
The fact that there's been an error in their application takes the applicant nowhere near a violation of article six.

<<7154.91;7165.31;en>>
Related to that, Judge Kouris asked a specific question about document 7 and what was meant by the words for the benefit of particular candidates.

<<7165.31;7168.27;en>>
There's no magic meaning to that and no significance to that.

<<7168.27;7174.63;en>>
It simply meant to whichever candidates happened to benefit from this once you applied this new weighting.

<<7174.63;7178.79;en>>
It wasn't referring to any particular individuals.

<<7178.79;7183.51;en>>
Simply, it was a general term to reflect whoever might be elevated.

<<7183.51;7192.15;en>>
And it's important to recall in this context the context in which that question was being asked and answered.

<<7192.15;7202.43;en>>
The minister had said to the evaluation committee, you've put forward 15 people for appointment, there are 15 places, can you give me a wider pool to consider?

<<7202.43;7210.55;en>>
And the response was, no, we don't think it would be appropriate to allow weighting to benefit some people over others.

<<7210.55;7221.15;en>>
But it wasn't identifying AE or anyone else, far less providing any substance to the conspiracy theories advanced by the applicant.

<<7221.15;7229.15;en>>
And that takes me back to Judge Kouris' question again, which I've already responded to in substance, but I emphasise it again.

<<7229.15;7232.03;en>>
There was no horse trading here.

<<7232.03;7236.47;en>>
The theory advanced by the applicant makes no chronological sense whatever.

<<7236.47;7240.23;en>>
It's compellingly rejected in all of the materials before the court.

<<7240.23;7243.67;en>>
I emphasise again document 63 and 64.

<<7243.67;7250.31;en>>
And it was never put in these extremely heightened ways before the domestic court.

<<7250.31;7265.91;en>>
And that leaves finally, I think, Judge Turkovich's question, what would be the consequence of annulment at the domestic level and what implications, if any, would the statute of limitations have?

<<7265.91;7285.27;en>>
Now, so far as that's concerned, the potential for reopening cases and the major problem in terms of legal certainty that that illustrates is not a potential that is met by any implication of statute of limitations.

<<7285.27;7303.15;en>>
Indeed, one of the cases I referred to in my earlier submissions, the decision decided in 2012, which we can provide to the court, case number 30, 1997, concerned events occurring years earlier.

<<7303.15;7318.15;en>>
So the consequences, if the chamber judgment is upheld, are unknown and uncertain, but give rise to very real prospect of further challenges and endless challenges.

<<7318.15;7338.67;en>>
And as I said in my submissions earlier, they would allow any applicant, anywhere in the Council of Europe, to identify any defect in an appointment process and bring a challenge, even in the most extreme case, where the evidence was crystal clear, where they pleaded guilty, where years had gone by.

<<7338.67;7349.79;en>>
And that, with respect, does very justly merit the description of the dissenting opinion that to accede to the applicant's case would be to open a Pandora's box.

<<7349.79;7349.79;en>>
Mr President, those are my only submissions.

<<7354.75;7355.79;en>>

<<7355.79;7361.11;en>>

<<7366.77;7368.01;fr>>
Merci beaucoup, M. le Président.

<<7368.21;7369.29;fr>>
J'avais demandé au...

<<7371.57;7372.45;fr>>
Je me dirige au requérant.

<<7375.93;7391.41;fr>>
J'avais demandé au requérant expressément s'il souhaitait, en plus du dédommagement de l'article 41, s'il souhaitait la réouverture de son procès dans l'hypothèse, bien entendu, que la Cour conclue en violation de l'article 6.

<<7392.29;7394.65;fr>>
La réponse... On n'a pas besoin d'avoir une réponse écrite.

<<7394.89;7395.89;fr>>
C'est oui ou non.

<<7395.89;7402.21;fr>>
Et je crois que je suis suffisamment fondé pour vous exiger une réponse claire tout de suite à ce sujet-là. Merci.

[[JudgeP;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<7405.5;7408.46;en>>
Thank you very much.

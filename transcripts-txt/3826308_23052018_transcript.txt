La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<56.93;58.53;en>>
Please be seated.

<<71.27;78.69;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of Georgia versus Russia number two.

<<78.69;88.85;en>>
The case was lodged with the court on 11 August 2008 on Article 33 of the Convention by the government of Georgia.

<<88.85;98.95;en>>
The application was allocated to the fifth section of the court, pursuant to Rule 51, Paragraph 1 of the rules of the court.

<<98.95;108.21;en>>
A chamber constituted within that section declared the application admissible on 13 December 2011.

<<108.21;121.13;en>>
On 3 April 2012, the chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction in favor of the Grand Chamber, none of the parties having objected to the relinquishment.

<<121.13;138.17;en>>
On 6 March 2014, the president of the Grand Chamber granted leave to the Human Rights Center of the University of Essex under Rule 44, Paragraph 3 of the rules of the court to submit written comments as a third party.

<<138.17;148.97;en>>
From 6 to 17 June 2016, a delegation of judges took oral evidence from 33 witnesses in Strasbourg.

<<148.97;156.37;en>>
The government of Georgia are represented by Mr. Gocha Lordkipanidze, Deputy Minister of Justice,

<<156.37;160.45;en>>
and by Mr. Beka Dzamashvili, government agent of Georgia

<<160.45;165.53;en>>
at the court, assisted by Mr. Ben Emmerson, QC, Mr. Rodney

<<165.53;172.61;en>>
Dixon, QC, counsel, and by Mrs. Tamar Rostiashvili, Mrs. Mariam

<<172.61;176.13;en>>
Bilikhodze, Mrs. Nana Tchanturidze,

<<176.13;181.37;en>>
and Mr. Giorgi Nakashidze, advisors.

<<181.37;188.69;en>>
The governments of the Russian Federation are represented by Mr. Mikhail Galperin, representative

<<188.69;196.17;en>>
of the Russian Federation at the court, assisted by Mr. Michael Swainston, QC, Mr. Paul Wright,

<<196.17;200.77;en>>
Mr. Richard Blakeley, Mr. Edward Harrison, Mr. Khristofor

<<200.77;206.19;en>>

<<206.19;210.85;en>>
counsel, and by Mrs. Yana Borisova, Mr. Pavel Smirnov,

<<210.85;215.33;en>>
Mr. Aleksandr Gorshkov, and Mr. Stanislav Shkodenko, advisors.

<<215.33;220.45;en>>
I welcome the representatives of the parties in the name of the court.

<<220.45;231.49;en>>
I also welcome a group of visiting judges from Georgia and a group of visiting judges from the Russian Federation who are attending the hearing today.

<<231.49;247.65;en>>
I would explain that in addition to interpreting in the two official languages of the court, English and French, interpreting into Georgian and Russian has been authorized for the benefit of the visiting judges from Georgia and the Russian Federation.

<<247.65;256.91;en>>
That interpreting is not arranged by the court, and no transcription of the oral translation will be included in the official record of the proceedings.

<<256.91;264.57;en>>
Having consulted the representatives of the parties, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<264.57;268.09;en>>
Mr. Emmerson, for the government of Georgia, will speak first.

<<268.09;270.67;en>>
And then Mr. Galperin and Mr. Swainston,

<<270.67;272.85;en>>
for the government of the Russian Federation.

<<272.85;274.05;en>>
I call Mr. Emmerson.

<<274.05;274.05;en>>
Please, you have the floor.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<276.71;281.63;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<281.63;289.91;en>>
this year marks the centenary of Georgia's Declaration of Independence from Imperial Russia.

<<289.91;299.83;en>>
Ever since 1918, Georgia has striven towards building a social democracy on the European model.

<<299.83;315.39;en>>
Russia has never accepted this choice and has subjected Georgia throughout the last 100 years to various military and political campaigns aimed at crushing the spirit of democracy and independence in the country.

<<315.39;328.15;en>>
This year's centenary celebrations are sadly muted because the Russian Federation is once again in belligerent occupation of Georgian territory.

<<328.15;333.55;en>>
This occupation began as long ago as the 1990s.

<<333.55;341.79;en>>
But today's hearing is focused on events that occurred in 2008, almost exactly 10 years ago.

<<341.79;353.83;en>>
During the first week of August 2008, separatist forces in the Khinvali region of Georgia began to mobilize for a conflict.

<<353.83;365.43;en>>
They had been armed and trained by the Russian Federation and began shelling ethnic Georgian villages in the region known by Russia as South Ossetia.

<<365.43;382.19;en>>
On the evening of the 7th of August 2008, approximately 31,000 Russian ground forces entered Georgia, crossing South Ossetia and Abkhazia and moving into the rest of Georgian territory.

<<382.19;389.47;en>>
They joined Russian forces that were already deployed in those regions.

<<389.47;399.11;en>>
The Georgian civilian population was confronted by the largest and most powerful army in Europe.

<<399.11;405.35;en>>
The notion that the Russian forces were there to keep the peace is, we say, a transparent myth.

<<405.35;414.09;en>>
As the events unfolded, it became clear that far from being neutral in the conflict, Russia was, in fact, the driving force behind it.

<<414.09;428.99;en>>
Genuine peacekeepers don't bomb villages, terrorize, murder, and lock up ordinary civilians, torch their houses or steal their belongings, drive them out and occupy their lands.

<<428.99;441.71;en>>
But that's exactly how the Russian forces behaved, working hand in hand with the local militia who they controlled and let loose on the Georgian population.

<<441.71;445.51;en>>
We've seen this pattern in other conflicts.

<<445.51;453.19;en>>
In the Balkan Wars, it came to be known by the term ethnic cleansing.

<<453.19;477.23;en>>
The evidence proves the commission of widespread convention violations, both during the two days of active hostilities and after hostilities had ceased, as Russian forces advanced unopposed through large swathes of Georgia, even threatening to take the capital, Tbilisi.

<<477.23;488.27;en>>
Between the 8th and 12th of August, Russian military aircraft carried out more than 100 aerial attacks on Georgian territory.

<<488.27;499.51;en>>
The court has heard direct eyewitness testimony that civilians and civilian objects were attacked in areas where there was no Georgian military presence.

<<499.51;515.43;en>>
The court has also received a substantial body of documentary evidence that corroborates this testimony, as well as satellite footage, video and photographic material, phone intercepts, aviation radar and flight logs, and medical records.

<<515.43;525.55;en>>
In addition, the Russian aerial bombardment of civilian targets has been recorded by a range of international observers.

<<525.55;542.99;en>>
The overall picture is clear that as well as targeting some military objects, the Russian planes undoubtedly bombed ethnic Georgian villages, hitting people's homes, shops and churches, killing many civilians and injuring many more.

<<542.99;551.15;en>>
Initially, Georgian forces remained in position and attempted to defend the population from this invasion.

<<551.15;557.95;en>>
However, at 5 a.m. on the morning of 10 August 2008,

<<557.95;566.31;en>>
Georgia ordered its forces to withdraw and declared a unilateral ceasefire by diplomatic notice.

<<566.31;578.15;en>>
The following day, the 11th, Georgia made its application to this court for interim measures to bring the Russian violations to an end.

<<578.15;593.11;en>>
Although the active fighting in and around South Ossetia thus ended relatively quickly, a concerted campaign of making Georgian villages uninhabitable then began.

<<593.11;606.91;en>>
This continued for months after the active fighting had come to an end until nearly the entire ethnic Georgian population of South Ossetia had been expelled and their villages destroyed and looted to prevent their return.

<<606.91;620.07;en>>
Many of the convention violations alleged in this application were committed well behind Russian lines after hostilities had ended and the Georgian military forces had withdrawn.

<<620.07;629.11;en>>
On the 12th of August, the ceasefire agreement brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy was agreed by Georgia.

<<629.11;633.15;en>>
It was agreed by Russia the following day.

<<633.15;643.83;en>>
However, in flagrant and immediate violation of the terms of this agreement, the Russian military advance into Georgia continued.

<<643.83;655.51;en>>
By the 19th of August, it had become clear that Russia did not intend to abide by its undertaking to withdraw to the positions it had held before hostilities began.

<<655.51;664.71;en>>
President Medvedev announced that Russian troops would remain in unilaterally declared buffer zones around South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

<<664.71;682.43;en>>
Russia then announced that it was to establish 37 military posts in undisputed Georgian territory, 18 in areas adjacent to South Ossetia, and 19 in areas adjacent to Abkhazia.

<<682.43;696.03;en>>
These military positions extended 20 kilometers south of the South Ossetian occupation line and 40 kilometers to the south and southeast of the Abkhazian occupation line.

<<696.03;711.03;en>>
After the intervention and mediation of the EU, Russia eventually withdrew from the so-called buffer zones on the 10th of October, but continued to occupy South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

<<711.03;721.07;en>>
They remain today in occupation of approximately 20% of Georgia's overall landmass.

<<721.07;727.51;en>>
These are clearly not the actions of peacekeepers.

<<727.51;742.43;en>>
Before and after the cessation of hostilities, Russian ground troops, acting together with Ossetian forces and other irregular troops operating under effective Russian control, entered ethnic Georgian villages.

<<742.43;748.87;en>>
Many of the inhabitants of these villages had by this time fled or been evacuated.

<<748.87;759.65;en>>
Those who remained were predominantly elderly or infirm, or either unable or too frightened to uproot themselves.

<<759.65;774.19;en>>
Russian ground troops sealed the villages off using entry and exit checkpoints and allowed ethnic Georgian homes and entire villages to be burnt to the ground.

<<774.19;784.61;en>>
Individuals were threatened with death if they refused to leave, and there were summary executions of Georgian civilians purely on the grounds of their ethnicity.

<<784.61;798.39;en>>
The systematic nature of this deadly campaign led the OSCE to condemn what it described, and I quote, as a disturbing pattern of killings of unarmed civilians.

<<798.39;803.75;en>>
A number of the crimes were perpetrated by Russian forces directly.

<<803.75;813.83;en>>
Others were committed in the presence of Russian forces who sometimes encouraged or assisted the local militias, or otherwise made no attempt to prevent them.

<<813.83;828.09;en>>
There is overwhelming eyewitness and other evidence establishing that Russian ground forces had the authority and ability to prevent the arbitrary execution of ethnic Georgian civilians and the looting and destruction of their homes.

<<828.09;846.11;en>>
But far from upholding Russia's obligations as an occupying power to maintain public order and security, its ground forces adopted a calculated policy of facilitating the commission of these crimes, and in some instances, of participating in them directly.

<<846.11;857.35;en>>
This conduct was witnessed firsthand by some of those who gave evidence before the court in the evidential hearing, and it's recorded in numerous other sources.

<<857.35;868.63;en>>
Witness after witness spoke of having observed Russian troops wearing Russian uniforms, with Russian flags, and speaking with pure Russian accents, overrunning their towns and villages.

<<868.63;880.03;en>>
They were able to identify Russian military equipment and Russian flags flying on the tanks and armaments that attacked their villages and killed their families, neighbors, and friends.

<<880.03;909.23;en>>
Georgia submits that the Russian military and political campaign involves widespread and systematic violations of Articles 2, 3, 5, and 8 of the Convention, and of Articles 1 and 2 of the First Protocol, and Article 2 of the Fourth Protocol to the Convention, as interpreted and applied in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of international humanitarian law.

<<913.35;930.59;en>>
These acts, these crimes, each constitute, we say, individual violations of the Convention.

<<930.59;940.63;en>>
But taken together, they amount to an administrative practice that is plainly incompatible with the Convention's requirements.

<<940.63;965.31;en>>
The Court's case law has defined an administrative practice as, and I quote, an accumulation of identical or analogous breaches, which are sufficiently numerous and interconnected to amount not merely to isolated incidents, but to a pattern or system, a test, we say, that is more than satisfied on the evidence.

<<965.31;972.91;en>>
That is how the Court first described the administrative practice test in Ireland against the United Kingdom in 1978.

<<972.91;978.27;en>>
And it is the test that has been consistently applied ever since.

<<978.27;989.85;en>>
Russia's rampage through Georgia's territory can't be conveniently split into different incidents or different phases for the purpose of assigning state responsibility.

<<989.85;992.23;en>>
It was one campaign.

<<992.23;1004.73;en>>
On the evidence, it unquestionably amounted to an uninterrupted military campaign, decades in the making, to occupy as much of Georgia as it could get away with.

<<1004.73;1018.75;en>>
In the present case, all of the evidence shows that Russia pursued an administrative practice of gross human rights violations in order to displace forever the ethnic Georgian population of the separatist regions.

<<1018.75;1023.57;en>>
These violations were obviously not isolated, unconnected incidents.

<<1023.57;1026.75;en>>
They amount to a repetitive pattern or system.

<<1026.75;1049.19;en>>
Indeed, that was how, that was the very means by which the underlying Russian military strategy to expel ethnic Georgian civilian population from the area was put into practice through the commission of crimes that would either destroy them or destroy their homes or terrify them into leaving.

<<1049.19;1057.75;en>>
A most revealing piece of evidence before the court comes from Vladimir Putin himself.

<<1057.75;1064.07;en>>
During a news conference in Moscow on the fourth anniversary of the Russian invasion, Mr. Putin said this, and I'm going

<<1064.07;1066.83;en>>
to read his exact words to you.

<<1066.83;1074.71;en>>
It's not a secret, the plan was prepared by the general staff.

<<1074.71;1084.03;en>>
Moreover, within the framework of this plan, we carried out the preparation of the South Ossetian militias.

<<1084.03;1087.99;en>>
They have played their part.

<<1087.99;1092.71;en>>
In the evidence submitted by Georgia, you have the video itself that depicts Mr. Putin speaking

<<1092.71;1104.15;en>>
these words with subtitles at annex 44A of our most recent submission, as well as a rough transcript that was introduced in evidence at the oral hearing.

<<1104.15;1125.13;en>>
Just pausing there for a moment in that short statement and analyzing what its significance is for this hearing, we say you have here the best evidence you could hope to receive an unambiguous admission from the president of Russia on the very issue you have to decide.

<<1125.13;1128.91;en>>
By this statement, Mr. Putin admitted two things.

<<1128.91;1137.63;en>>
First, he admitted that the Russian military operation was not a spontaneous reaction to the sporadic engagements of the first week of August.

<<1137.63;1147.59;en>>
Rather, it was planned, he said, well in advance, ready to put into effect when Moscow judged that it had an excuse for its action.

<<1147.59;1154.35;en>>
He said at the end of 2006 or early 2007, it was agreed by the general staff.

<<1154.35;1158.55;en>>
So that explodes the peacekeeping myth altogether.

<<1158.55;1160.59;en>>
The second thing that Mr. Putin admitted

<<1160.59;1168.79;en>>
in that short statement is that Moscow had trained the South Ossetian militia in preparation for what became the August conflict.

<<1168.79;1181.31;en>>
In other words, Russia was, as we have always said, using the secessionist militias as proxy forces to fight alongside the Russian troops and do the dirtiest work.

<<1181.31;1191.27;en>>
Moscow had been engaged in capacity building the very forces that committed the most wicked, shocking, and gruesome of the atrocities proved in the evidence.

<<1194.39;1209.63;en>>
War tactics like that are typically adopted so as to enable a regular army to issue plausible denials of involvement in war crimes.

<<1209.63;1218.35;en>>
But in the present case, Russia doesn't seem to care whether its denials are plausible or not.

<<1218.35;1241.43;en>>
As I will show, so audacious are the lies and distorted confabulations in the Russian case before this court that we seem to have moved from an era of plausible deniability into one of implausible deniability.

<<1241.43;1245.71;en>>
With that overview, may I turn to the substantive submissions.

<<1245.71;1256.59;en>>
And the first question for the court is whether the alleged violations fell within the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation, as that term is understood in Article 1 of the Convention.

<<1256.59;1278.79;en>>
Specifically, whether the Russian Federation exercised authority or effective control over the territories where the violations took place at the time the violations took place through their armed forces or a subordinate local administration or in collaboration with the local forces or police.

<<1278.79;1302.95;en>>
According to the court's case law, it is now clear that the violations alleged in the present application, we say, fall squarely within the Article 1 jurisdiction of the Russian Federation under three separate but interrelated and overlapping principles, which apply where a state's acts take effect outside its national territory.

<<1302.95;1319.95;en>>
The first is the principle of state agent authority, which does not depend upon the physical detention of an individual in a building, vehicle, or vessel, but upon the exercise of authority over the individual victim.

<<1319.95;1331.35;en>>
The second is the effective control of an area of territory outside a contracting state's national territory through invasion.

<<1331.35;1343.15;en>>
And the third is the commission of violations by the forces of a subordinate administration, which depends for its existence upon the military, political, and economic support of a contracting state.

<<1343.15;1347.07;en>>
All three principles are in play in the present case.

<<1347.07;1358.07;en>>
They are independent principles of law, each of which is capable on its own of establishing extraterritorial jurisdiction on the facts of this case.

<<1358.07;1372.31;en>>
But in the present case, where all three intersect and overlap, the arguments in favor of Article 1 jurisdiction, at least from the 7th of August onwards, are overwhelming.

<<1372.31;1390.35;en>>
When the principle of state agent authority is invoked, the exact scope of the obligations owed to individual victims depends, in the words of the Al-Skyni judgment, on the concrete situation of the individual vis-a-vis the agents of the respondent state.

<<1390.35;1408.33;en>>
In the context of Russia's military invasion of Georgia, it is self-evident, we say, that the human rights violations proved on the evidence took place whilst the individual victims were under the effective power and control of the forces of the Russian Federation.

<<1408.33;1427.81;en>>
The second head of extraterritorial jurisdiction identified in Al-Skyni arises when, as a consequence of military action, whether it's lawful or unlawful to start with, a contracting state exercises direct and effective control of an area outside its national territory.

<<1427.81;1436.75;en>>
In this case, the areas in which the alleged violations occurred clearly, we say, fell under effective control of Russia at the relevant time.

<<1436.75;1453.95;en>>
By the morning of the 8th of August, Russia had already had military dominance and effective control on the ground of a large part of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and total control of the airspace.

<<1453.95;1474.35;en>>
It's true that Russia consolidated and extended its area of control over the next few days, but the evidence shows that it had already crossed the threshold for effective control of the territory where the violations were committed by at the latest the early hours of the 8th of August.

<<1474.35;1517.87;en>>
Russia's effective control of the de facto regions is evidenced by the deployment of large troop numbers on the ground, many of them already in position before August, the appointment of key political personnel, the construction of military bases in the breakaway regions, the provision of essential budgetary support for the administrations, the conferral of Russian citizenship through a passportization campaign in Georgian territory of Georgian civilians, the application of Russian legislation across the two territories.

<<1517.87;1521.59;en>>
Russian legislation, for heaven's sake.

<<1521.59;1528.63;en>>
Russia was legislating for South Ossetia before this happened.

<<1528.63;1538.91;en>>
The application of Russian legislation and the establishment of electoral constituencies enabling citizens to vote in Russian elections.

<<1538.91;1546.13;en>>
So they're electing, and they did indeed recently contribute to the election of Mr. Putin,

<<1546.13;1551.59;en>>
but had done so prior to the 2008 conflict.

<<1551.59;1585.35;en>>
The United Nations Human Rights Committee, after examining the evidence in detail, concluded as long ago as November 2009, nearly 10 years ago, that at the relevant time, the territory of South Ossetia was under the de facto control of an organized military operation by the Russian Federation, which gave rise, they said, to international responsibility, not only for the actions of its own forces, but also for those of other subordinated armed groups.

<<1585.35;1596.19;en>>
And the Council of Europe's own parliamentary assembly has described the Russian operation as an occupation of a significant part of the territory of Georgia.

<<1596.19;1602.95;en>>
For the Council of Europe, this was and is now a belligerent occupation.

<<1602.95;1619.93;en>>
The parliamentary assembly has also expressed the view that Russia bears full responsibility for violations of the convention in the areas under its de facto control, including for the acts committed at the behest of the de facto authorities in Shkinvali.

<<1619.93;1621.97;en>>
So that is one of the issues you've got to decide.

<<1621.97;1629.55;en>>
You know what the parliamentary branch of this institution has already concluded.

<<1629.55;1632.95;en>>
This proposition, we say, can scarcely be in doubt.

<<1632.95;1648.35;en>>
With 31,000 troops on the ground from the 7th of August, more than 1,200 pieces of armor and heavy artillery, 200 aircraft, 40 helicopters, the control of the territory was effective from the moment of their arrival.

<<1648.35;1659.07;en>>
More than 15,000 Russian troops were moved immediately into South Ossetia, and more than 15,000 were moved into Abkhazia.

<<1659.07;1673.87;en>>
By the 10th of August, when the Georgian forces, I remind you, withdrew altogether, Russian control of the territory had become not merely effective, the test for this court, but absolute.

<<1673.87;1680.63;en>>
Russian troops set up checkpoints at the southern edge of the occupied area of Gori District.

<<1680.63;1700.63;en>>
They established at least six such checkpoints along the southern edge of the so-called buffer zone, well into Georgian territory, well beyond the territory of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, securing and consolidating the area of control that they established long before.

<<1700.63;1706.27;en>>
Russia also reinforced the administrative boundaries of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

<<1709.23;1749.51;en>>
We say it's clear from all the evidence not just that Russia secured the external boundaries, but that within the two occupied territories, Russia's armed forces set up military checkpoints at or near almost every occupied Georgian village, overseeing the entry and exit points, and overseeing the looting and destruction that then took place in those villages under their noses during the period after the cessation of hostilities.

<<1749.51;1756.75;en>>
In April 2009, Russian FSB border guards were stationed along the administrative boundaries.

<<1756.75;1763.63;en>>
So by now, by then, nine months later, the FSB is patrolling the boundaries.

<<1763.63;1777.59;en>>
And in June 2011, three years after the cessation of hostilities, the European Parliament noted that Russian troops were still occupying South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

<<1777.59;1792.75;en>>
The court has consistently held that it is immaterial whether a state exercises effective control over a territory directly or through the support it provides to a subordinate local administration.

<<1792.75;1808.91;en>>
The history of Russian military and political support for the secessionist aspirations of the de facto authorities is summarized in detail in Georgia's written submissions on the merits at paragraphs 41 to 82.

<<1808.91;1834.39;en>>
Basing itself on that evidence, we submit that the de facto authorities were under the effective control of the Russian Federation many years before 2008, that this control persisted and intensified throughout the conflict, and that it remains in place today in respect of the entire territory of these two areas.

<<1834.39;1844.59;en>>
That control, we say, is demonstrated clearly by Russia's direct involvement in the administrations themselves.

<<1844.59;1856.83;en>>
Russian appointed officials have occupied all of the most senior positions in the de facto government of South Ossetia, including the positions of prime minister, minister of defense, and minister of the interior.

<<1856.83;1872.15;en>>
In each case, these were Russian military service personnel who apparently retained their military status in the Russian armed forces even after coming to Shibvali as the de facto leaders of its so-called independent government.

<<1872.15;1895.23;en>>
Immediately after the 2008 hostilities, there was an intensification of military and financial assistance, as well as open political support expressed through Russia's recognition, the only state in the world to do this, of the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states.

<<1895.23;1909.63;en>>
As noted, we say, by the International Crisis Group in 2009, Russia continues, in effect, to control South Ossetia politically, financially, and militarily.

<<1909.63;1929.15;en>>
These de facto regimes can readily, must readily, be characterized as subordinate local administrations through which Russia exercised effective control over the territory, over and above the control it exercised through its military presence in the regions.

<<1929.15;1944.79;en>>
In situations of complete dependency such as this, the International Court of Justice has stated that rules of customary international law apply to attribute the acts of the secessionist entity to the state that is supporting it.

<<1944.79;1946.59;en>>
That's customary law.

<<1946.59;1969.39;en>>
In its Bosnia judgment, the International Court of Justice held that persons, groups of persons, or entities may, for the purposes of international responsibility, be equated with state organs if those persons, groups, or entities act in complete dependence on the state of which they are ultimately merely the instrument.

<<1969.39;1984.71;en>>
Any other solution, the ICJ said, would allow states to escape their international responsibility by choosing to act through persons or entities whose supposed independence would, in reality, be purely fictitious.

<<1984.71;1988.55;en>>
It's a perfect description of the facts of the present case.

<<1988.55;1998.59;en>>
And as the Alaska case demonstrates, an almost identical principle is recognized in the jurisprudence of this court.

<<1998.59;2017.59;en>>
In its written pleadings, the Russian Federation has just skated over this critical rule of attribution and misleadingly focused instead on a separate rule which only applies where there is no relationship of dependency.

<<2017.59;2028.75;en>>
And in those circumstances, customary law demands effective control over the operations of the relevant organ of the non-state entity.

<<2028.75;2041.51;en>>
So if there's a relationship of dependency of the sort that we've described, there is no such requirement to show detailed operational control of the operations on the ground.

<<2041.51;2048.15;en>>
But Russia chooses instead to focus on a rule which does not apply on the facts of this case.

<<2048.15;2056.67;en>>
This is not the test laid down to the application of Article I. This court's consistent approach

<<2056.67;2083.71;en>>
has been to hold that once it has been established that a state has effective control through its agents or subordinate authorities, the state owes human rights obligations to all individuals that have thereby come within its jurisdiction, whether or not it is directing the actual individual military operations in which the violations are directly inflicted.

<<2083.71;2089.55;en>>
The level of connection operates structurally at a higher point in the analysis.

<<2089.55;2093.71;en>>
It's the connection between the two entities.

<<2093.71;2124.27;en>>
Indeed, a contracting state thinking this way has a positive obligation under Article I to secure, for example, the right to life of those falling within its jurisdiction and to take operational measures, reasonable operational measures, to protect individuals against the violation of the right to life, even if it is perpetrated by a private individual, just in an ordinary situation.

<<2124.27;2127.95;en>>
That's the dritvehkunde, horizontal effect.

<<2127.95;2129.03;en>>
It's the Osmond case.

<<2129.03;2133.11;en>>
It was first articulated by the Grand Chamber in Osmond.

<<2133.11;2140.39;en>>
But it applies clearly, applies equally to situations where the Article I jurisdiction is extraterritorial.

<<2140.39;2154.63;en>>
Russia had a positive obligation to protect the lives of those citizens within its jurisdiction from homicidal attacks by non-state actors.

<<2154.63;2157.35;en>>
End of.

<<2157.35;2166.15;en>>
Whatever question there may be about the exact extent of a state's positive obligations in this situation, one thing is clear beyond doubt.

<<2166.15;2175.31;en>>
As this court has explained, the particular rule of attribution under public international law, relied on by Mr. Swainston in a misplaced argument,

<<2175.31;2185.87;en>>
the rule that requires detailed operational control, is just not applicable where a subordinate local administration survives by virtue of support from a contracting state.

<<2185.87;2198.27;en>>
Next, it's been submitted by the Russian Federation that in times of international conflict, human rights treaties such as this convention do not apply.

<<2198.27;2214.79;en>>
The suggestion is that international humanitarian law is the lex specialis, applicable to all issues arising in the context of an international armed conflict, and that the provision of the conventions are in effect automatically suspended for the duration of the convention.

<<2214.79;2222.15;en>>
And that the provision of the conventions are in effect automatically suspended for the duration of the conflict.

<<2222.15;2238.11;en>>
This ambitious and misconceived argument flies in the face of a clear consensus among judicial and academic opinion that international human rights law continues to apply in times of armed conflict.

<<2238.11;2242.27;en>>
I'm not going to go into the history of the development of this point.

<<2242.27;2253.55;en>>
But the question was confronted squarely and answered directly by the Grand Chamber in its 2014 decision in Hassan against the United Kingdom.

<<2253.55;2269.67;en>>
There, the court expressly rejected the United Kingdom's mission that in a state of armed conflict, the operation of international humanitarian law displaces the applicability of the European Convention on Human Rights.

<<2269.67;2280.39;en>>
Georgia would also point out that the Russian Federation has never relied in the course of its arguments on the derogation principles of Article 15.

<<2280.39;2292.53;en>>
All of the crimes alleged by Georgia thus involve violations of international humanitarian law, as well as violations of the convention.

<<2292.53;2300.43;en>>
There is no material conflict between the two regimes on the facts of this case.

<<2300.43;2314.79;en>>
We have analyzed in our written submissions each crime, each alleged violation, not only against the provisions of the convention, but also against the relevant applicable provisions of international humanitarian law.

<<2314.79;2317.79;en>>
And the result in each case is the same.

<<2322.83;2327.79;en>>
Mr. President, I turn now to the question of proof.

<<2327.79;2341.95;en>>
The court has heard oral evidence and received abundant written evidence from independent sources and eyewitnesses attesting to the aerial bombardments conducted by the Russian Federation.

<<2341.95;2353.83;en>>
At a minimum, that evidence establishes without question that Russian forces failed properly to distinguish between combatants and civilians.

<<2353.83;2375.51;en>>
At a minimum, even in those instances where there might arguably be said to have been a military target somewhere in the vicinity, Russian forces failed to employ methods and means of attack aimed at limiting collateral damage to civilians and civilian objects.

<<2375.51;2385.63;en>>
In some instances, regrettably, the evidence leads to the inevitable inference that civilians and civilian objects must have been deliberately targeted.

<<2388.55;2394.71;en>>
Again, I quote the OSCE's own contemporary findings.

<<2394.71;2410.11;en>>
They said this, although some of the bombing was aimed, some of the bombing was aimed at military targets, much of it appeared to fall indiscriminately on civilian targets.

<<2410.11;2414.95;en>>
That's the view of the OSCE at the time.

<<2414.95;2428.67;en>>
This court received oral testimony from local Georgian witnesses concerning the bombing of the villages of Eredvi, Kabi, and Tortiza on the 8th, 9th, and 12th of August.

<<2428.67;2447.27;en>>
It's worth just pausing to point out for those following the proceedings that those three villages were selected by the court itself as representative samples illustrating a much wider pattern of attacks on ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia.

<<2447.27;2453.59;en>>
In each case, both those three and the others, the pattern is the same.

<<2453.59;2470.15;en>>
Munitions were dropped directly on civilian houses, killing and injuring many civilians, or in town squares, or on churches, in clear violation of the principles of humanitarian law.

<<2470.15;2476.99;en>>
The attacks are corroborated by flight logs, photographs, and satellite imagery showing the damage.

<<2476.99;2487.35;en>>
They're also corroborated by the OSCE NGOs and a vast number of written statements, signed and sworn, that were submitted to the court.

<<2487.35;2500.39;en>>
The same pattern of attacks in Eredvi, Kabi, and Tortiza is shown to have occurred in 68 other towns and villages which had a predominantly or significantly ethnic Georgian population.

<<2500.39;2512.63;en>>
And this court heard the individual villagers themselves come and tell the court how the bombs dropped on their churches, on their neighbors' houses, and in the middle of a gathering in the village square.

<<2512.63;2515.49;en>>
There's no denying that the events occurred.

<<2515.49;2517.99;en>>
The question is how and why.

<<2517.99;2534.43;en>>
Despite the incontroversial evidence that these attacks took place, the Russian Federation has put forward no evidence and no explanation whatsoever to try to justify them.

<<2534.43;2537.67;en>>
That is one of the most remarkable features of this case.

<<2537.67;2552.47;en>>
Usually in war crimes litigation, the focus of attention is on the justification for the nature and extent of the force used against the target in order to determine whether humanitarian law principles were fully observed.

<<2552.47;2578.69;en>>
And that, indeed, is precisely how the court went about its task, requiring Georgia to produce evidence to demonstrate that a particular attack, in fact, occurred, and at the same time requiring Russia to identify the legitimate military target for that particular attack and to explain how civilian damage came to be inflicted.

<<2578.69;2587.31;en>>
Georgia duly produced the evidence establishing what in international criminal courts is called the crime base.

<<2587.31;2598.31;en>>
But when it came to Russia's turn to explain or justify or contextualize its military attacks, there was just a deafening silence.

<<2598.31;2610.83;en>>
The response of the Russian military officials who gave evidence to the court didn't even attempt to identify any legitimate military targets in the vicinity of the proven attacks.

<<2610.83;2631.75;en>>
Instead, they simply denied that these villages had been attacked by Russian Aryan forces at all, suggesting that all of the eyewitnesses who came along to testify and the hundreds of others who gave evidence in writing and all of the international organizations had made up their accounts.

<<2631.75;2636.51;en>>
The suggestions were, at times, preposterous and almost comic.

<<2636.51;2649.95;en>>
Russia even went so far as to suggest that the Georgian military might have bombed its own villages and civilians in order simply to implicate the Russians.

<<2649.95;2673.47;en>>
The one thing the Russian side did not do was to produce any records or provide any coherent account or explanation or witness or evidence concerning their actual military deployments or their intended targets, despite the court's specific and explicit request that that is what they should do.

<<2673.47;2687.15;en>>
If I have to choose one example of the Russian tomfoolery in this case to illustrate the point, I would focus on the Iskander attack on the Gori town center on the 12th of August.

<<2687.15;2714.83;en>>
I choose this incident because the evidence proves conclusively that the Russian side has deliberately set out to mislead this court and all of you, deliberately, offering explanations that cannot be reconciled with the objective facts.

<<2714.83;2718.15;en>>
Mr. President, we say, and looking at it in detail,

<<2718.15;2736.91;en>>
I'd ask you to find that if the Russian side is prepared to sink to these depths on this aspect of the case, then we respectfully submit that you can't afford to believe a word they say unless it is corroborated by solid independent proof.

<<2736.91;2740.23;en>>
They have set out to mislead.

<<2740.23;2748.23;en>>
Let me remind the court of the key evidence, paying particular attention to the sequence in which it emerged.

<<2748.23;2761.71;en>>
The court received a considerable body of written and oral testimony about an attack by missile on the square, civilian square, in Gori town center.

<<2761.71;2769.97;en>>
The square was hit by an Iskander SS-26 rocket that released cluster munitions.

<<2769.97;2777.63;en>>
A Dutch journalist called Stan Storemans and 11 other civilians were predictably killed.

<<2777.63;2782.01;en>>
This was an attack on a civilian center.

<<2782.01;2788.39;en>>
The missile also caused extensive damage to civilian property in the vicinity of the square.

<<2788.39;2799.25;en>>
And the cluster munitions it was carrying left characteristic pockmarks in the cobbled square, on the street, on the pavement of the walls that are still visible today.

<<2799.25;2803.97;en>>
Mr. Storeman's body was repatriated to the Netherlands

<<2803.97;2813.11;en>>
where fragments of shrapnel from the missile were removed from his flesh during a post-mortem operation.

<<2813.11;2820.87;en>>
The court heard from members of an independent Dutch investigation team that was set up to investigate this incident.

<<2820.87;2846.43;en>>
The Dutch team concluded, beyond doubt, from fragments that they examined forensically and from other evidence gathered at the scene, as well as from viewing and analyzing the video footage that showed the attack being perpetrated by Russian forces using the Iskander rocket, an item which is only to be found in the weaponry of the Russian Federation.

<<2846.43;2853.79;en>>
They were able to identify the rocket as being of Russian origin by its serial number.

<<2853.79;2858.75;en>>
A wealth of other evidence corroborating this attack has been available for some time.

<<2858.75;2870.23;en>>
And as with every other attack on a civilian target, the Russian side was asked to identify what its legitimate military strategy for shooting this rocket was.

<<2870.23;2874.47;en>>
And they made no attempt at all to offer any explanation.

<<2874.47;2877.63;en>>
They must know.

<<2877.63;2892.95;en>>
But they called no evidence at all about their use of the Iskander missile or their military deployments within striking distance of Gori on the 12th of August or put forward any legitimate military target.

<<2892.95;2907.75;en>>
At the evidential hearing, the Russian military witnesses just denied that Russian forces had any responsibility for the attack, notwithstanding that it was using a Russian rocket.

<<2907.75;2914.63;en>>
When asked to account for the shrapnel recovered in Holland from Mr. Storriman's flesh, they sought

<<2914.63;2923.01;en>>
to suggest that the chain of custody for his body must have been deliberately falsified and the fragments planted in his body.

<<2923.01;2926.79;en>>
Seriously.

<<2926.79;2942.95;en>>
When asked to account for the finding of the missile remains with serial numbers identifying it as a Russian munition, they absurdly suggested that the whole crime scene must have been fabricated for the propaganda purposes.

<<2942.95;2946.87;en>>
It was, I suspect, a difficult moment for all of us in court.

<<2946.87;2952.27;en>>
These are intended to be solemn proceedings, and the subject could hardly be more serious.

<<2952.27;2983.51;en>>
Yet here was the Russian Federation, a member state of the Council of Europe, seriously trying to persuade the Grand Chamber that the missile engine that had been photographed in situ in another member state of the Council of Europe was a plywood fake, a piece of anti-Russian propaganda, and that the hole it had made in the roof of a nearby property was all part of some rapidly put together fake crime scene fabricated to blame the Russians.

<<2983.51;2985.09;en>>
Plywood, seriously.

<<2985.09;2988.63;en>>
That was the suggestion.

<<2988.63;3000.25;en>>
The Dutch team, Russia argued, must be unreliable and biased, and the video footage showing the rocket incoming from Russian-held territory must have been doctored by some sinister hand.

<<3000.25;3003.35;en>>
This, then, was the quality of the Russian response.

<<3003.35;3006.35;en>>
This is how seriously they take these proceedings.

<<3006.35;3019.91;en>>
One is left wondering whether their officials have lived so long without a genuinely independent and impartial judiciary that they can't even be bothered to make up potentially convincing lies.

<<3019.91;3027.67;en>>
No need for plausible deniability, if implausible deniability will do just as well.

<<3027.67;3029.83;en>>
But then came the death knell.

<<3029.83;3041.95;en>>
The court has now seen an unassailable expert report that came into existence long after Russia had completely denied any involvement in the gory attack.

<<3041.95;3050.59;en>>
This expert report was prepared precisely in order to test Russia's ridiculous plywood excuses.

<<3050.59;3059.55;en>>
It confirms that the missile came from a stock, a particular stock, that had been designated for Russian use only.

<<3059.55;3064.31;en>>
It could not, therefore, have been planted, as Russia tried to suggest.

<<3064.31;3078.11;en>>
The central claim at the heart of Russia's case that the whole attack on Gori was invented and the evidence fabricated is thus conclusively proved to be a lie.

<<3078.11;3081.15;en>>
Important, because they knew that.

<<3081.15;3084.15;en>>
They must have known that they shot the Iskander.

<<3084.15;3093.07;en>>
And the Russian authorities, the Russian state authorities, must have known that they had records that they had discharged that Iskander.

<<3093.07;3099.47;en>>
And yet, they set out deliberately to lie to you about it.

<<3099.47;3103.59;en>>
As the court is aware, the International Criminal Court is now on the scene.

<<3103.59;3110.47;en>>
And they are currently conducting their own investigation into the Iskander attack on Gori.

<<3110.47;3117.87;en>>
The court has decided not to await the arrival of the ICC report before proceeding with today's hearing.

<<3117.87;3132.79;en>>
We can only assume that this must be because the judges are already satisfied on the evidence of Russian state responsibility for this attack, because the court's decision would otherwise be extremely difficult to understand.

<<3132.79;3140.21;en>>
As the court is aware, remnants of the missile have been available for inspection in Georgia since November 2007.

<<3140.21;3148.51;en>>
Subsequently, the remaining fragments were repatriated and have been available since the 23rd of April of this year.

<<3148.51;3170.63;en>>
I should add that in its most recent written submissions at annexes 11 to 16, Georgia submitted further evidence of the indiscriminate use of another type of ballistic missile, the Tochka USS-21, by the Russian side, which thus contributes to its relationship with the overall administrative practice of the Russian Federation.

<<3170.63;3173.79;en>>
Where does all this leave the court?

<<3173.79;3182.39;en>>
We submit that the totality of the existing evidence is not simply proof of Russia's responsibility for one constituent crime.

<<3182.39;3191.29;en>>
It is proof that the Russian side has not approached these proceedings in good faith and was prepared to peddle what Russia must have known to be lies.

<<3191.29;3198.79;en>>
Russian forces fired that missile, but the plain fact is that their generals came to this court to lie about it.

<<3198.79;3200.47;en>>
And there's a pattern here.

<<3200.47;3230.67;en>>
Every time we have direct evidence of an attack, including photographs, satellite, eyewitnesses, witness statements, oral testimony, and every time Russia is asked to offer some sort of explanation in military terms for what it has done, and every time Russia offers no explanation, instead just bandying about accusations against everyone else that they're lying and cheating and that the witnesses of little villagers have come to court to make up, put their heads together on grand conspiracy.

<<3230.67;3244.75;en>>
And yet the only party who can be proved to have engaged in lying and cheating this court in the course of this litigation is those who are responsible on the Russian side.

<<3244.75;3266.95;en>>
In addition to the four case studies selected by the court, Georgia has provided you with substantial and compelling evidence of the attacks on the 68 other villages, as well as direct military attacks on civilian vehicles and convoys escaping the conflict, and the summary execution of Georgian civilians on the grounds of their ethnicity.

<<3266.95;3277.23;en>>
All of these acts are in breach of international humanitarian law and amount to war crimes, but they also amount to a systematic violation of Article 2.

<<3277.23;3291.43;en>>
Likewise, the campaign of targeted burning, destruction, and looting of Georgian villages is conclusively proven by a consistent body of international evidence, as well as by numerous eyewitness accounts.

<<3291.43;3306.23;en>>
Witnesses testified to the presence and direct participation of Russian forces acting with Ossetian irregulars as they burned people's homes to the ground, randomly shot civilians dead, and stole civilian property.

<<3306.23;3318.39;en>>
Again, the OSCE concluded that a campaign of ethnic cleansing, in its words, had been waged by Russian and local forces together.

<<3318.39;3329.55;en>>
The same conclusion was reached by the co-rapporteurs of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, noting that Russian forces have failed to protect any properties under their control.

<<3329.55;3332.63;en>>
It would be astonishing if this court came to any other conclusion.

<<3332.63;3336.11;en>>
Astonishing.

<<3336.11;3360.59;en>>
Based on all of the evidence taken together, the government of Georgia invites the court to conclude that the Russian Federation adopted an administrative practice of causing or permitting the destruction of Georgian homes and villages in order to make them uninhabitable in violation of Article 8, Article 1 of the First Protocol, and the applicable rules of humanitarian law.

<<3360.59;3382.31;en>>
Each attack on a civilian object constitutes an individual violation, but the gravity of the overall policy lies in the systematic collective action taken against one ethnic group, repeatedly identified at the time by all of the relevant international organizations, as a joint Russian-South Ossetian campaign of ethnic cleansing.

<<3386.43;3405.15;en>>
In addition to summary executions and the bombing and destruction of Georgian homes in 68 towns and villages, Russian and Ossetian forces detained at least 160 ethnic Georgian civilians who had remained in South Ossetia or in villages along the administrative border.

<<3405.15;3414.11;en>>
The detainees were mostly elderly, and the overwhelming majority were detained long after the cessation of active hostilities.

<<3414.11;3426.91;en>>
Most were held for approximately two weeks in the basement of the de facto Ministry of Interior building in Skrinvali, in conditions described by Human Rights Watch as inhuman and degrading.

<<3426.91;3432.27;en>>
They were frequently subjected to ill treatment, including beatings and mock executions.

<<3432.27;3440.39;en>>
Some were ill treated during transfer to the center, others on arrival, and others repeatedly during the period of their incarceration.

<<3440.39;3450.99;en>>
Many were subjected to verbal and physical abuse, and some of them were forced to work in the streets of Skrinvali collecting corpses and burying them in mass graves.

<<3450.99;3462.55;en>>
One was told to urinate on a Georgian flag, and when he refused to do so, he was beaten by both Russian and Ossetian soldiers until he was unconscious.

<<3462.55;3471.47;en>>
The Russian Federation denies, surprise, surprise, that there were any Russian officials at this facility.

<<3471.47;3478.03;en>>
When the Georgian witnesses came to give evidence to the court and said, yes, there were, Mr. Swainston

<<3478.03;3482.67;en>>
accused them of lying, making it up.

<<3482.67;3489.39;en>>
However, as we've seen so often in this case, the devil is in the detail.

<<3489.39;3500.83;en>>
The most senior Russian general in the case, called for Russia, had made a witness statement several years before on the 30th of December, 2014.

<<3500.83;3511.35;en>>
And in that statement, he'd made the telling mistake of admitting that there were Russian investigators at the facility interrogating the detainees.

<<3511.35;3514.23;en>>
He put it in writing, and he'd signed it.

<<3514.23;3519.35;en>>
But they'd forgotten when they marked it the false case designed to mislead you.

<<3519.35;3524.03;en>>
Once again, the allegation made by Mr. Swainston in court,

<<3524.03;3540.51;en>>
two honest, genuine, civilian individuals who've been brought all the way from IDP camps on the border to Strasbourg to tell their story, were accused repeatedly of some absurd conspiracy.

<<3540.51;3553.27;en>>
The idea that they put their heads together to lie about those detentions and the involvement of Russian forces in them is obviously, I suggest, completely fanciful.

<<3553.27;3562.75;en>>
And yet, and yet, the Russian side is quite happy to bandy about allegations like that.

<<3562.75;3579.95;en>>
Because when you're desperate and your back is against the wall, when you have no answer to the case against you, when you can't provide an explanation because there isn't one, the last refuge of the desperate advocate is to call everybody a liar.

<<3579.95;3581.19;en>>
You will not be fooled.

<<3584.91;3610.79;en>>
So basing itself on all of the evidence, we submit that the Russian Federation adopted the administrative practice of causing or permitting arbitrary detention in breach of Article 5 and sustained and serious ill treatment of civilian detainees in violation of Article 3 as interpreted and applied compatibly with humanitarian law principles.

<<3610.79;3614.79;en>>
I'm moving towards the very last phase of my submissions.

<<3614.79;3616.35;en>>
Mr. President, I want to turn now

<<3616.35;3621.83;en>>
to torture and summary execution of prisoners of war.

<<3621.83;3632.59;en>>
The evidence shows that more than 30 prisoners of war were tortured after they had been captured by enemy forces and were ordered to combat.

<<3632.59;3641.39;en>>
I do not need to explain the extent to which that is in violation of the principles of humanitarian law.

<<3641.39;3644.67;en>>
Two of them were summarily executed.

<<3644.67;3647.71;en>>
One was beaten to death.

<<3647.71;3655.43;en>>
In addition to repeated brutal beatings, the evidence shows that one prisoner had his ear cut off.

<<3655.43;3659.47;en>>
Several were subjected to mock executions.

<<3659.47;3666.11;en>>
A number of prisoners were tortured with lighters, causing serious burns to their fingers.

<<3666.11;3669.27;en>>
Some had their fingers deliberately snapped, broken.

<<3669.27;3672.55;en>>
One was repeatedly stabbed in the leg with a bayonet.

<<3672.55;3677.59;en>>
One had his teeth removed with a pair of pliers.

<<3677.59;3681.11;en>>
One was subjected to strangulation with rubber straps.

<<3681.11;3684.71;en>>
And one was tortured with electrocution.

<<3684.71;3688.35;en>>
The court heard direct testimony from some of these men.

<<3688.35;3693.15;en>>
One of them told how he was detained by Russian and Ossetian soldiers acting together.

<<3693.15;3697.03;en>>
He could recognize the Russian soldiers, he said, by their uniforms.

<<3697.03;3705.83;en>>
And because they spoke with a pure Russian accent, he was beaten repeatedly in various locations and then handed into the custody of the Russian FSB.

<<3705.83;3708.91;en>>
So there's no doubt about who's involved there.

<<3708.91;3713.03;en>>
Two of his colleagues in detention were summarily executed.

<<3713.03;3721.23;en>>
Another testified about repeated beatings by Russian soldiers and corroborated the murder of one of his colleagues.

<<3721.23;3730.59;en>>
A third told the court how he was captured and held by Russian soldiers who repeatedly electrocuted him whilst he was being interrogated.

<<3730.59;3733.11;en>>
Again, he was accused of lying by Mr. Swainston, who

<<3733.11;3741.07;en>>
suggested that it wasn't possible because you'd have to have a different kind of implement when the man was standing there and testifying to this.

<<3741.07;3746.15;en>>
He lost consciousness each time as a result of the unbearable pain.

<<3746.15;3752.35;en>>
But each time, the soldiers would pour water over him to start the process up all over again.

<<3752.35;3757.95;en>>
There is a substantial body of corroborative and medical evidence supporting these accounts.

<<3757.95;3770.37;en>>
There is even a video showing one of the POWs, Georgi Antkalidze, beaten to death, which the court can find at annex 28b of our most recent written submissions.

<<3770.37;3781.87;en>>
For completeness, there are also videos submitted with Georgia's submissions on the evidence hearing, which show clearly Russian military personnel involved in the detention of POWs.

<<3781.87;3794.15;en>>
Based on all the evidence, we invite the court to conclude that the named individuals were tortured, as they allege, and that the Russian Federation bears responsibility for those violations of Article III.

<<3794.15;3800.59;en>>
We also submit that those acts of torture are formed part of an overall administrative practice.

<<3800.59;3812.13;en>>
Finally, as a result of the conflict and the campaign of ethnic cleansing that followed, many thousands of ethnic Georgians fled from South Ossetia and adjacent territories.

<<3812.13;3816.39;en>>
From Russia's point of view, the campaign had served its purpose.

<<3816.39;3838.83;en>>
In 2008, the OSCE concluded that ethnic Georgians were being prevented by Russia from returning and considered this to be, and I quote, an ongoing violation of the Russian Federation's obligation to facilitate and ensure that displaced persons can return voluntarily to their former places of residence in safety and dignity.

<<3838.83;3857.03;en>>
The European Parliament found that ethnic cleansing and forcible democratic changes had taken place under Russia's occupation of South Ossetia and that Russia was responsible for the human rights violations committed in those areas, including the violations of the Right to Free Movement.

<<3857.03;3868.71;en>>
Since the August conflict, the total ethnic Georgian population of South Ossetia has been permanently reduced by more than 20,000 people.

<<3868.71;3878.07;en>>
The Georgian civilians comprising that group of IDPs have been prevented ever since from returning to their homes.

<<3878.07;3892.17;en>>
The United Nations Secretary General reports annually to the General Assembly on the numbers to see if there has been any successful repatriation, and they have remained consistent from 2008 to today.

<<3892.17;3895.71;en>>
Based on all the evidence, Mr. President,

<<3895.71;3912.11;en>>
we say that the Russian Federation adopted and continues to adopt an administrative practice of frustrating the right of ethnic Georgian IDPs to return to their homes in violation of Article 2 of the Fourth Protocol.

<<3912.11;3913.83;en>>
Those are my submissions.

<<3913.83;3918.23;en>>
I have not, you will notice, directly addressed the question of non-exhaustion.

<<3918.23;3923.87;en>>
It's not clear to us at this stage whether the Russian Federation continues to maintain that.

<<3923.87;3926.47;en>>
I will deal with it in detail in reply if I need to or in answer to any questions from the court.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<3929.51;3932.91;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Emmerson.

<<3932.91;3934.91;en>>
Now I call Mr. Galperin, please, you have the floor.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<3935.91;3938.67;en>>
Mr. President of the Court of Distinguished Judges,

<<3938.67;3945.39;en>>
the Opposing Council started surprisingly with some dates and anniversaries from the Georgian history.

<<3945.39;3963.51;en>>
I will also take this example, and I would like to remind that just 95 years ago, in December 1922, South Ossetia was included to the territory of Georgia by Joseph Stalin, who is apparently a Georgian born in Gori, who was the Minister of Nationalities at that time.

<<3963.51;3968.47;en>>
And nobody asked Ossetians if they want to become a Georgian there.

<<3968.47;3976.83;en>>
In 70 years after that, Georgians tried to enforce this decision by invading South Ossetia and killing civilians.

<<3976.83;3979.83;en>>
The same attempt took place in August 2008.

<<3981.55;3990.51;en>>
I have the honor to address you on some important points raised by the court's questions to the parties, and Mr. Swainston QC will then address you further.

<<3990.51;4007.95;en>>
The court's questions cover the issue of effective control, whether the court can deal with matters of international humanitarian law, whether there was any administrative practice behind attacks on Georgian civilians, what the situation is now, and whether domestic remedies have been exhausted.

<<4007.95;4013.43;en>>
These questions have been answered in writing, but I wish to add some further observations.

<<4013.43;4025.19;en>>
This is the first case where the court has considered applying convention law to a major active armed conflict, and the immediate consequences of such a conflict in a rather huge area.

<<4025.19;4030.35;en>>
I would be wrong for this court to do so for a number of reasons.

<<4030.35;4042.95;en>>
First, and answering the court's first question, Russia had no effective control over the territory where the conflict occurred, and Russian state agents had no jurisdiction over alleged victims.

<<4042.95;4052.99;en>>
As regard allegations of bad targeting, it is obvious that there is no effective control over people or places where weapons are fired in a time of conflict.

<<4052.99;4058.95;en>>
There is obviously no necessity of control of jurisdiction where the weapons land.

<<4058.95;4063.31;en>>
Nothing in the court's jurisprudence requires any different results.

<<4063.31;4071.27;en>>
On the contrary, the Bankovic case makes clear that when weapons are fired, there is no jurisdiction by this fact.

<<4071.27;4081.87;en>>
The recent cases of Hassan versus United Kingdom and Jaloud versus Netherlands are no authority for a different approach because they are very different from this case.

<<4081.87;4086.11;en>>
In Hassan, as the courts observed, there was clear effective control.

<<4086.11;4092.39;en>>
The court noted that the applicant had been within the physical power and control of United Kingdom.

<<4092.39;4099.75;en>>
Soldiers, and therefore, fell within United Kingdom jurisdiction under the principle outlined in paragraph 136 of Al-Skinni.

<<4101.11;4112.03;en>>
Similarly, in Jaloud, the situation was one of established state agent control with soldiers in a policing role with power over people who pass through their checkpoints.

<<4112.03;4118.07;en>>
The writer of these cases doesn't extend the court's jurisdiction to targeting in active conflict.

<<4118.07;4132.91;en>>
These cases are also irrelevant in relation to the treatment of captives in this case, whether civilian or military, because there is no convincing evidence that Russian troops had state agent authority over any alleged victims of abuse.

<<4132.91;4142.19;en>>
As regard the post-active conflict situation, Russia also didn't have effective control over the areas where abuses are alleged to have acute in any sense.

<<4142.19;4149.19;en>>
We certainly didn't have any effective control in the sense of the practical ability to prevent all such abuses.

<<4149.19;4159.19;en>>
In this regard, it is important not to adopt a formulaic approach by this court that Russia must have had effective control because it had lots of troops on the ground.

<<4159.19;4169.35;en>>
Those troops were fully engaged, they faced substantially greater numbers of Georgian troops and the risk of counterattack even after Georgia's initial withdrawal.

<<4169.35;4176.71;en>>
It is also important to recognize the consequences of Georgia's barbaric attack on Tskhinvali.

<<4176.71;4181.75;en>>
Georgia destroyed the law enforcement capability of the South Ossetian government.

<<4181.75;4190.91;en>>
At the same time, Georgia created intense inter-ethnic antagonism and criminal disorder over a huge area of South Ossetia.

<<4190.91;4199.23;en>>
That hate-filled criminal disorder could not be controlled by anyone whether the South Ossetian government or Russian forces.

<<4199.23;4204.71;en>>
In other words, Georgia created the opposite of effective control.

<<4204.71;4208.43;en>>
Russian troops did their best to protect Georgian civilians.

<<4208.43;4221.59;en>>
Those doing their best included Russian peacekeepers, or rather the remaining Russian peacekeepers after they were decimated by Georgia's attack on them in breach of the peacekeeping agreement and all human decency.

<<4221.59;4225.47;en>>
That answers the court's third question about administrative practice.

<<4225.47;4228.19;en>>
Russian forces tried to protect Georgians.

<<4228.19;4233.55;en>>
It is absolutely clear that there was no administrative practice against Georgian people.

<<4233.55;4242.67;en>>
The court's second question asked whether this court has jurisdiction over the case given the relationships between the convention and international humanitarian law.

<<4242.67;4254.91;en>>
No doubt, the court asked this question because it is clear that international humanitarian law applies to all of these issues raised by Georgia in relation to both the conflict and the situation afterwards.

<<4254.91;4269.31;en>>
The answer is that states, including Russian Federation, have not consented to the resolution of issues of international humanitarian law by this court, whose remit is confined very specifically to the convention.

<<4269.31;4273.59;en>>
The Council of Europe has no role in relation to state defense.

<<4273.59;4279.79;en>>
In this matter, Russia was forced to respond to military aggression with the resources immediately at hand.

<<4279.79;4287.87;en>>
It had to defend its peacekeepers and civilians in South Ossetia who came under brutal and sustained attacks by Georgians.

<<4287.87;4293.99;en>>
Russia's right to defend its peacekeepers and nationals is not subject to the jurisdiction of this court.

<<4293.99;4303.11;en>>
The exercise of it created a situation governed by the laws of armed conflict, international humanitarian law, and not the convention.

<<4303.11;4318.79;en>>
If this court insists on applying the convention, its only relevant scope concerns the use by Georgia of massive military force against South Ossetians, when in theory, it considered South Ossetians to be its own people and citizens.

<<4318.79;4330.79;en>>
Some juries have suggested that this court can apply convention right to conflict, and if they are somehow modified to reflect the obligation of states under international humanitarian law.

<<4330.79;4341.79;en>>
But such juries have no clear answers on how to decide which set of rules, convention, law, or international humanitarian law should apply in any particular case.

<<4341.79;4347.31;en>>
I would like to read one suggestion from Una Hathaway, a prominent academic in this area.

<<4347.31;4353.19;en>>
She says that there are three theoretical approaches to the relationship between the two bodies of law.

<<4353.19;4355.43;en>>
First is the displacement model.

<<4355.43;4358.07;en>>
Second is the complementarity model.

<<4358.07;4360.79;en>>
Third is the conflict resolution model.

<<4360.79;4370.59;en>>
In the conflict resolution model, when an armed conflict is present, the decision maker must evaluate the relationship between human rights law and humanitarian law.

<<4370.59;4375.63;en>>
If they are, in fact, complementary, then both are applied.

<<4375.63;4389.39;en>>
If the conflict, however, the model offers three possible decision rules again, event-specific displacement, reverse event-specific displacement, and specificity for deciding the appropriate body of law to be applied.

<<4389.39;4400.19;en>>
This is difficult enough for lawyers to understand, impossible to apply with certainty, and totally incapable of practical use in urgent situation on a battlefield.

<<4400.19;4406.71;en>>
Essex University in England has made similar suggestion by way of academic intervention in this case.

<<4406.71;4411.19;en>>
And they suggest what they call context-dependent interplay.

<<4411.19;4416.75;en>>
With respect, this is just a shorter formula that expresses the same confusion.

<<4416.75;4427.31;en>>
I also respectfully urge the court to remember that law is more important outside the court in its practical application every day than in court.

<<4427.31;4430.11;en>>
Generals and soldiers are not jurists.

<<4430.11;4433.31;en>>
They have clear rules in international humanitarian law.

<<4433.31;4436.79;en>>
We should not, with respect, spoil this clarity now.

<<4436.79;4441.59;en>>
If we do spoil it, civilians may suffer more in the future.

<<4441.59;4448.15;en>>
Next, the court has asked about the situation now and whether there are any ongoing violations.

<<4448.15;4453.95;en>>
We assume that the court has in mind the situation of displaced Georgian civilians.

<<4453.95;4465.51;en>>
It is the position that Georgians fled from some areas, particularly near Tskhinval, and it is the case that the governments of South Ossetia and Abkhazia maintain borders with Georgia.

<<4465.51;4471.47;en>>
Please note that those governments set their borders policies themselves with a vigorous independence.

<<4471.47;4477.59;en>>
Russia is not responsible for them, and also Russia has provided personnel to help secure the borders.

<<4477.59;4485.59;en>>
It is, with respect, understandable that South Ossetia and Abkhazia should maintain their border security in the following circumstances.

<<4485.59;4492.59;en>>
On the evidence before this court, the government of South Ossetia cites a history of provocation across the border.

<<4492.59;4503.11;en>>
Quite plainly, Georgia has attacked twice with huge military force against civilians, including in 1992 displacing 100,000 Ossetians.

<<4503.11;4507.03;en>>
Georgia has not renounced the use of force even now.

<<4507.03;4514.19;en>>
Georgia refuses to engage on the situation of displaced South Ossetian people in political discussions in Geneva.

<<4514.19;4524.27;en>>
However, the court should also have in mind that even though there are borders, both South Ossetia and Abkhazia have worked out some practical elevation of border controls.

<<4524.27;4528.51;en>>
Very many people cross South Ossetian and Abkhazian borders every year.

<<4528.51;4536.95;en>>
For example, in 2016, over 1 million cases of lawful crossing of the state border between Abkhazia and Georgia were registered.

<<4536.95;4540.79;en>>
Thousands of people also cross into South Ossetia.

<<4540.79;4546.31;en>>
This is practical working reality, which over time can assist reconciliation between countries.

<<4546.31;4557.43;en>>
However, now Georgia seeks a one-sided intervention from this court in respect of displaced Georgian people without addressing the situation of displaced Ossetians.

<<4557.43;4562.23;en>>
In my respectful submission, a one-sided intervention would not help.

<<4562.23;4567.91;en>>
It would only worsen tensions between communities where relations are still tense.

<<4567.91;4576.11;en>>
It would destroy any prospect of the normality that needs to prevail before people on both sides can safely return.

<<4576.11;4584.23;en>>
To be clear, the only legal basis on which people can return is if their dignity and safety can be assured.

<<4584.23;4589.03;en>>
All international commentators and relevant international bodies have recognized that, actually.

<<4589.03;4610.27;en>>
For example, the representative of the UN Secretary General on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons has called on all parties to take all necessary steps to ensure persons displaced by the recent and past conflicts are able to enjoy their right to return voluntarily to their former homes in safety and dignity.

<<4610.27;4622.39;en>>
In circumstances where South Ossetians and Georgians were living in the same villages and in neighboring villages, people must be reconciled with one another before they can live in harmony.

<<4622.39;4638.39;en>>
For this reason, for example, the report of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights recommended that the parties urgently pursue efforts towards peaceful political solutions to the conflict, taking into account fundamental OSCE principles.

<<4638.39;4652.25;en>>
Any solution should guarantee that all persons will be able fully to enjoy all of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and that the rights and interests of minority communities will be fully respected.

<<4652.25;4663.19;en>>
The same report called for consideration of confidence building measures to promote constructive goodwill between the sides, respect for each other concerns, and reconciliation.

<<4663.19;4670.59;en>>
Unfortunately, Georgia has refused to engage on the issue of displaced Ossetian people in political discussions in Geneva.

<<4670.59;4675.09;en>>
Instead, it seeks a unilateral advantage in this court today.

<<4675.09;4680.03;en>>
Finally, the court has asked whether domestic remedies have been exhausted.

<<4680.03;4692.43;en>>
I cannot speak for South Ossetia and Abkhazia, but I can say that if any of Georgia's allegations had been true, there would be remedies in Russian courts as set out in Russian's observations on admissibility.

<<4692.43;4698.75;en>>
Russia's investigative authorities have requested Georgia's assistance with appropriate investigations.

<<4698.75;4702.27;en>>
Those requests were and are genuine.

<<4702.27;4707.27;en>>
They have been rejected without good reason by the Georgian side.

<<4707.27;4713.83;en>>
I ask the court to note that the independent international fact-finding mission made this recommendation.

<<4713.83;4724.31;en>>
Any individuals believed to have been involved in human rights violations or other serious crimes should be held to account and prosecuted in accordance with the law.

<<4724.31;4731.43;en>>
The parties should cooperate in exchanging information and evidence for such prosecutions.

<<4731.43;4735.27;en>>
Unfortunately, Georgia has ignored this injunction too.

<<4735.27;4741.39;en>>
It seeks instead to put an impossible burden of fact finding on this court.

<<4741.39;4750.55;en>>
The limits of this court resources were recognized recently in the Copenhagen Declaration, which placed emphasis on the need to exhaust domestic remedies.

<<4750.55;4765.75;en>>
It plainly cannot deal with complex matters on the current scale, as it apparent from the fact that Russia was only allowed 15 minutes to cross-examine each of Georgia's witnesses and their evidence hearing in June 2016.

<<4765.75;4774.23;en>>
Moreover, other false and dubious evidence was presented by Georgia, which takes time to challenge by technical means.

<<4774.23;4779.31;en>>
It follows that for many reasons, this case is beyond this court jurisdiction.

<<4779.31;4788.79;en>>
And it is also clear that the invocation of this court's purported jurisdiction is unhelpful in terms of any necessary political solution.

<<4788.79;4793.67;en>>
Georgia's application should be dismissed for these reasons and the further reasons to be explained by Mr. Swenson.

<<4793.67;4793.67;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4795.65;4797.89;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Galperin.

<<4797.89;4799.89;en>>
Please, Mr. Swainston.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<4805.02;4809.22;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<4809.22;4815.82;en>>
the court has asked a number of questions focused on alleged violations of the convention.

<<4815.82;4827.98;en>>
The first point to bear in mind is that these are alleged violations, whatever the level of invective with which they are expressed.

<<4827.98;4833.62;en>>
They are alleged by Georgia, and they are firmly denied by Russia.

<<4833.62;4845.47;en>>
And that conflict on the facts raises a fundamental question about the capacity of this court to address issues of humanitarian law on such a scale.

<<4845.47;4848.86;en>>
Events in war are confused.

<<4848.86;4852.82;en>>
Much of the evidence is necessarily classified.

<<4852.82;4861.3;en>>
And as we shall see, there is a real danger of propaganda being put forward as proof.

<<4861.3;4867.59;en>>
Georgia, I regret to say, has done precisely that.

<<4867.59;4878.78;en>>
One clear fact is that Georgia launched an appalling indiscriminate attack on Skinval, a sleeping civilian city.

<<4878.78;4885.22;en>>
And it launched an attack on Russian peacekeepers and Russian nationals.

<<4885.22;4903.9;en>>
When Russia responded, as it was fully entitled to do, Georgia and its allies launched an extraordinary propaganda campaign to distract from Georgia's own aggression by trying to paint Russia as a ruthless invader.

<<4903.9;4915.22;en>>
And now, before this court and before the evidential hearing, Georgia tried to put forward some of that same propaganda as purported evidence.

<<4915.22;4920.14;en>>
This case really does show the fog of war.

<<4920.14;4931.26;en>>
And that, as we'll come to, is material to the question of whether this court should be dealing with international humanitarian law at all.

<<4931.26;4951.9;en>>
In terms of evidence, all I can do now, entirely without prejudice to the burden of proof and the standard of proof on Georgia to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, is to give some examples of the falsehood that we have encountered.

<<4951.9;4959.76;en>>
First, Georgia claimed that its outrageous attack on Skinval was a response to Russian invasion.

<<4959.76;4966.52;en>>
And Georgia relies on supposed telephone intercepts from guards at the Rocky Tunnel.

<<4966.52;4973.06;en>>
But that is quite obvious nonsense for the following very straightforward reasons.

<<4973.06;4977.74;en>>
We prefer evidence to invective.

<<4977.74;4982.94;en>>
First, it took Georgia weeks to come up with the invasion argument.

<<4982.94;4989.94;en>>
And there's been no sensible explanation for the time taken to produce the alleged tapes.

<<4989.94;4994.7;en>>
We've created for this hearing an open exhibit, which I believe the judges have.

<<4994.7;5003.38;en>>
And if you look at pages four and five, you see questions being put to Mr. Utiashvili

<<5003.38;5006.18;en>>
of the Georgian Interior Ministry.

<<5006.18;5010.42;en>>
Why did it take so long to produce the tapes?

<<5010.42;5012.34;en>>
He had no sensible answer.

<<5012.34;5014.55;en>>
The tapes had been lost, he said.

<<5014.55;5018.42;en>>
This critical evidence had been lost.

<<5018.42;5022.42;en>>
The true position on who started the conflict is clear.

<<5022.42;5034.14;en>>
In the evening of the 7th of August, 2008, on television, President Saakashvili of Georgia said this, I admire and respect Ossetian history and culture.

<<5034.14;5039.78;en>>
Every ethnic Ossetian has been an inseparable part of Georgian history for centuries.

<<5039.78;5042.55;en>>
We are proud of you and our unity.

<<5042.55;5045.26;en>>
Georgia is strong for its diversity.

<<5045.26;5050.62;en>>
Georgia has never been and will never be a mono-ethnic country.

<<5050.62;5054.74;en>>
Georgia belongs to all of us, regardless of our ethnicity.

<<5054.74;5057.42;en>>
Let's take care of our country together.

<<5057.42;5059.66;en>>
Let's together avoid the violence.

<<5059.66;5062.78;en>>
Let's work together for a better future.

<<5062.78;5067.18;en>>
Georgia is undertaking an immediate unilateral ceasefire.

<<5067.18;5074.34;en>>
We do not have the will to respond to violence with yet more violence.

<<5074.34;5089.18;en>>
But within hours of that false pledge of peace, there followed a truly barbarous attack on Skinval, which President Saakashvili had personally ordered earlier in the day.

<<5089.18;5098.14;en>>
You see pictures of that attack at pages 8 to 12 of the open exhibit.

<<5098.14;5107.9;en>>
You see there indiscriminate grad fire and artillery raining down on a sleeping civilian city.

<<5107.9;5118.78;en>>
It's almost sickening to hear Georgia today complain about alleged indiscriminate targeting.

<<5118.78;5122.86;en>>
This was a monstrous crime.

<<5122.86;5126.38;en>>
Moreover, it was thoroughly premeditated.

<<5126.38;5133.34;en>>
The Georgian assault used military plans drawn up with NATO symbols in 2007.

<<5133.34;5139.98;en>>
You've got those, one of them, at page 13 of the open exhibit.

<<5139.98;5147.74;en>>
So against that background, the alleged tapes of intercepts suggesting that Russia invaded first are absurd.

<<5147.74;5153.02;en>>
I draw your attention in that regard to the conclusion of the international fact-finding mission.

<<5153.02;5158.66;en>>
There was no ongoing armed attack by Russia before the start of the Georgian operation.

<<5158.66;5164.51;en>>
It could also not be verified that Russia was on the verge of such a major attack.

<<5164.51;5172.55;en>>
So these tapes, so long in gestation, were false evidence, and they were part of a pattern.

<<5172.55;5178.59;en>>
I agree with my learned friend, at least, that there is a pattern in this case.

<<5178.59;5182.94;en>>
But we will see points in the other direction.

<<5182.94;5192.47;en>>
In relation to the conflict itself, Georgia has also made, and repeated in this court, false claims that Russia bombed Georgian villages.

<<5192.47;5198.22;en>>
Initially, Georgia's claims of cluster bombing were endorsed by Human Rights Watch.

<<5198.22;5201.7;en>>
Its senior weapons expert was Mark Garlasco.

<<5201.7;5211.18;en>>
And in an announcement of the 15th of August, he identified what he said was a Russian RBK cluster bomb in a Georgian village.

<<5211.18;5216.94;en>>
You've got the announcement at page 20 of the open exhibit.

<<5216.94;5227.9;en>>
But you see on page 20 that there's a missing picture above the caption that Georgians look at the remnants of an RBK cluster bomb.

<<5227.9;5239.18;en>>
For some reason, Human Rights Watch has removed the picture from its English website, but it still exists on some of the other websites.

<<5239.18;5242.22;en>>
And if you look at page 26, you see what it was.

<<5245.22;5249.06;en>>
It's quite clearly a missile and not a bomb.

<<5249.06;5258.82;en>>
You see that the stabilizers are curved, and they curve around the body of the engine of the missile within the missile tube.

<<5258.82;5264.22;en>>
So how did a senior weapons expert misidentify a missile as a bomb?

<<5264.22;5273.1;en>>
Well, perhaps it's relevant to note that before working at Human Rights Watch, Mr. Garlasco had a long career in US military intelligence.

<<5273.1;5276.22;en>>
You've got that at page 28.

<<5276.22;5281.78;en>>
It's also relevant to note the comments of the court's own witnesses on this point.

<<5281.78;5290.74;en>>
Witness 35 is someone I'm not permitted to identify because of the strictures imposed on reference to the evidence hearing.

<<5290.74;5303.14;en>>
But he was a very experienced man, and he said that in general terms, it could not be a mistake for a weapons expert to confuse a missile with a bomb.

<<5303.14;5308.66;en>>
That's page 388 of 423 of the confidential transcript.

<<5308.66;5322.78;en>>
And it's important to note on this point, where false evidence has been deployed, that the real world position was entirely opposite to that portrayed by Mr. Garlasco

<<5322.78;5326.74;en>>
and his alleged picture of an RBK bomb.

<<5326.74;5342.7;en>>
The true position is that Georgia did hit its own villages with cluster missiles that Georgia had bought from Israel, and they carried M85 cluster bomblets.

<<5342.7;5362.97;en>>
Human Rights Watch has since admitted that it was misled by a dozen false witnesses interviewed separately who claimed that the damage from Georgia's own cluster missiles was caused by Russian planes that bombed their villages.

<<5362.97;5365.7;en>>
Georgia is fond of presenting witnesses.

<<5365.7;5369.02;en>>
My learned friend is fond of referring to them.

<<5369.02;5375.5;en>>
But the quality of the witnesses is shown by Human Rights Watch being misled.

<<5375.5;5384.74;en>>
Quite obviously, those false witnesses were put forward by Georgia as part of an information operation.

<<5384.74;5388.7;en>>
Georgia hit its own villages with these cluster weapons.

<<5388.7;5390.9;en>>
There's no doubt about that.

<<5390.9;5397.9;en>>
The only live question is whether they were hit accidentally or whether it was deliberate.

<<5397.9;5408.3;en>>
Just picking up some of the references, you've got Human Rights Watch admitting that they were misled by the dozen witnesses at page 30 of the exhibit.

<<5408.3;5416.3;en>>
At page 34, you've got Human Rights Watch suggesting that this could have been the result of malfunction of the weapons.

<<5416.3;5422.5;en>>
But of course, Human Rights Watch was strongly under the influence of Mr. Garlasco at that point.

<<5422.5;5441.06;en>>
And then on page 35, rather inconsistently, we've got the first Deputy Minister of Defense of Georgia expressing satisfaction with performance of Georgia's cluster weapons, which held up the Russian advance for several days.

<<5441.06;5444.7;en>>
Now, at the evidential hearing in this case, there was more of the same.

<<5444.7;5451.14;en>>
Georgia deployed witnesses to support Georgia's current allegations that villages were bombed.

<<5451.14;5464.02;en>>
Please note that Georgia has never acknowledged that Georgians were killed or injured by its own cluster missiles raining down on all of these Georgian villages.

<<5464.02;5470.74;en>>
Instead, Georgia has presented made-up stories of post-conflict killings.

<<5470.74;5474.42;en>>
For example, witness 22 said that Mr. Lalashvili

<<5474.42;5481.26;en>>
was shot in Terdznezi, one of the villages hit with Georgian cluster missiles.

<<5481.26;5484.39;en>>
He said that Mr. Lalashvili was shot,

<<5484.39;5490.62;en>>
but he also said at the evidence hearing that he was almost dismembered.

<<5490.62;5496.3;en>>
That sounds like a victim of cluster munitions, not shooting.

<<5496.3;5498.42;en>>
I could go on, but there isn't time.

<<5498.42;5502.7;en>>
Please note witness 23's evidence.

<<5502.7;5512.62;en>>
And please note that the witness was confused about whether the administrator of the relevant village, also Terdznezi, was a man or a woman.

<<5512.62;5521.9;en>>
It was very questionable whether some of the witnesses put up even came from the places that they were supposed to have come from.

<<5521.9;5541.1;en>>
The court should also note that even after Human Rights Watch was forced to acknowledge Georgian cluster attacks on Georgian villages, the NGO, the Georgian NGO behind August Ruins, the other major report on the conflict, continued to blame Russian bombing.

<<5541.1;5559.06;en>>
And so, for example, we get Human Rights Watch reporting that M-85s caused two casualties during a strike on Shindizi on the 9th of August, and Varnagogidze 45 was killed.

<<5559.06;5574.78;en>>
At the same time, August Ruins, in fact, later, with presumably full knowledge of the Human Rights Watch work, said that Ivangidze was killed from a bombing raid on Shindizi.

<<5574.78;5583.02;en>>
That's annex 277 to Georgia's submissions of the 30th of December, 2014, page 55.

<<5583.02;5591.14;en>>
Now, Georgia continued to produce unreliable witnesses to alleged Russian bombing at the evidential hearing in this case.

<<5591.14;5597.7;en>>
We had witness summaries prepared on their behalf, presumably, which said, for example, that they saw an airplane.

<<5597.7;5600.7;en>>
But then when they gave evidence, they hadn't seen an airplane.

<<5600.7;5604.66;en>>
If they had seen one, they would have said so.

<<5604.66;5613.62;en>>
I don't have time to go through the transcript, but I do urge the court to go carefully through the confidential transcript of evidence.

<<5613.62;5616.7;en>>
I can, perhaps, make one graphic point.

<<5616.7;5628.39;en>>
Perhaps because its witnesses were weak, Georgia embellished its allegations with purported radar plots showing Russian aircraft on alleged bombing runs.

<<5628.39;5635.06;en>>
Witness number nine, a Russian aviation expert, was presented with these radar plots and said they were unrealistic.

<<5635.06;5639.98;en>>
They showed the planes circling too long over what was supposed to be targets.

<<5639.98;5642.9;en>>
That would be suicide for a pilot.

<<5642.9;5651.06;en>>
After the evidential hearing in November, 2017, Georgia produced more radar plots, which are truly remarkable.

<<5651.06;5658.3;en>>
First, they showed Georgian radar seeing through the Caucasus Mountains all the way into Russia.

<<5658.3;5661.94;en>>
That would be impressive technology if it existed.

<<5661.94;5679.47;en>>
But in fact, it looks as though the authors of these plots forgot about the Caucasus Mountains altogether because the planes are shown flying at a steady height of 1,000 meters all the way from Russia, and the Caucasus Mountains don't go below 1,700 meters at their lowest point.

<<5679.47;5682.82;en>>
So the planes were flying through rock.

<<5682.82;5691.02;en>>
We have a line drawn on the profile of the mountains at page 37 of the open exhibit.

<<5691.02;5695.06;en>>
So once again, quite clearly, the plots are false.

<<5695.06;5700.9;en>>
And for completeness, barely three weeks ago, Georgia produced lots more plots.

<<5700.9;5703.9;en>>
They occupy some three CD-ROMs.

<<5703.9;5714.62;en>>
Of course, like much of the material that my learned friend likes to rely on, this comes too late for cross-examination or proper examination at the evidence hearing.

<<5714.62;5723.06;en>>
But we've checked, and the new material does not cure this impossibility of altitude.

<<5723.06;5740.34;en>>
But I agree with my learned friend that an important allegation in this case is that Russia fired an Iskander missile at the central square in Gori on the 12th of August, 2008, killing, amongst others, the Dutch journalist Stan Storermans.

<<5740.34;5748.22;en>>
Early news reports, which Georgia doesn't focus on very much or at all, said that Mr. Storermans was tragically

<<5748.22;5750.26;en>>
killed in a mortar attack.

<<5750.26;5757.22;en>>
You've got some excerpts from those in the open exhibit at pages 39 and 40.

<<5757.22;5779.94;en>>
Given that the attack happened as Georgian forces had left Gori and as Russian forces were arriving, we can guess who fired the mortars, given Georgia's consistent response to Russia's advance, even as it proceeded through Georgian villages where they fired cluster missiles.

<<5779.94;5788.14;en>>
However, Georgia and its allies did their best to blame Russia.

<<5788.14;5793.74;en>>
You will see, if you look closely at the evidence, that Mark Garlasco of U.S. Military Intelligence

<<5793.74;5797.26;en>>
and Human Rights Watch appears in this story, too.

<<5797.26;5805.82;en>>
Through Human Rights Watch, he said on the 15th of August, 2008, that the square had been struck by an RBK cluster bomb.

<<5805.82;5808.59;en>>
That's page 41 of the open exhibit.

<<5808.59;5813.94;en>>
And Human Rights Watch was supposed to have seen the nose cone of such a bomb.

<<5813.94;5817.1;en>>
However, shortly after that, Mr. Garlasco changed his position,

<<5817.1;5828.38;en>>
without explanation, to say that Russia attacked with the Iskander, a hugely powerful weapon which would have destroyed the square had it been fired.

<<5828.39;5838.18;en>>
The only evidence was purported photographs of the scene and of pieces of the missile.

<<5838.18;5842.39;en>>
And much of that initial material has disappeared from the internet.

<<5842.39;5846.06;en>>
But some is preserved in a report on Mr. Storiman's death

<<5846.06;5850.78;en>>
by his Dutch TV channel in 2009.

<<5850.78;5862.3;en>>
At page 50 of the open exhibit, you've got a still from that section of what seems to be the first video.

<<5862.3;5873.34;en>>
Please scrutinise that frame, because you'll see that the supposed section of missile has been superimposed on a background of grass and buildings, supposedly in Gori.

<<5873.34;5875.86;en>>
The outline of the missile is very distinct.

<<5875.86;5878.78;en>>
The grass and vegetation does not cross it.

<<5878.78;5883.82;en>>
The shadows on the missile section are inconsistent with the shadows on the buildings.

<<5883.82;5896.22;en>>
And please also watch the actual video, because if you do, you will see the grass behind waving through an apparent gap in this solid missile piece.

<<5896.22;5901.22;en>>
So quite plainly, this video is fake.

<<5901.22;5909.55;en>>
Now, with its submission in November 2017, Georgia produced for the first time another video attributed to Reuters.

<<5909.55;5913.74;en>>
Perhaps a misprint for Reuters, but perhaps not.

<<5913.74;5918.14;en>>
See page 52 of the open exhibit.

<<5918.14;5922.9;en>>
Page 51 is the grass waving through the gap in the missile.

<<5922.9;5925.94;en>>
52 is the Reuters quality version.

<<5925.94;5931.1;en>>
And this remake corrects the defect of the floating missile piece.

<<5931.1;5933.42;en>>
But old movies are often the best.

<<5933.42;5937.98;en>>
And the old movie here raises the central question relevant today.

<<5937.98;5942.55;en>>
Why did Georgia find it necessary to fake the original video?

<<5942.55;5954.22;en>>
The only sensible explanation is that initially, Georgia did not have real missile pieces or props to put in place to support its Iskander claim.

<<5954.22;5958.78;en>>
Now, over time, Georgia's claim has been embellished in various ways.

<<5958.78;5967.9;en>>
Thus, at page 45 of the open exhibit, we've got the most striking example of a fake picture.

<<5967.9;5974.62;en>>
It shows the tail of an Iskander missile resting on a sofa inside a top floor apartment.

<<5974.62;5986.98;en>>
And it's supposed to have entered through the ceiling on this side of the room, crossed the room, and then landed gently on the sofa for the world's press to photograph.

<<5986.98;5990.82;en>>
But the picture is physically impossible.

<<5990.82;5998.78;en>>
Russia did go to great lengths to disclose what it could in terms of classified information.

<<5998.78;6003.42;en>>
The tail of a real Iskander missile weighs hundreds of kilograms.

<<6003.42;6005.74;en>>
You'll see the figure in the evidence.

<<6005.74;6010.39;en>>
It comes down vertically at many times the speed of sound.

<<6010.39;6019.14;en>>
If it had truly hit an apartment block, it would have smashed through the entire building and buried itself in the basement.

<<6019.14;6022.94;en>>
Mr. Storeman's Dutch television channel recognized this

<<6022.94;6027.18;en>>
when they did a documentary on his tragic death.

<<6027.18;6041.1;en>>
And at page 49 of the open exhibit, you see their graphical representation after speaking to a German missile scientist of the tailpiece smashing down through a building.

<<6041.1;6045.42;en>>
So how could such an impossible photograph come about?

<<6045.42;6049.1;en>>
Well, again, chronology and context may help to explain.

<<6049.1;6053.1;en>>
You see that at page 43 of the open exhibit.

<<6053.1;6061.55;en>>
After Russia pulled back from Gori, an American military mission coordinated by the US State Department moved in.

<<6061.55;6068.48;en>>
And it turns out that the sofa picture was taken on the 25th of August by a US Navy photographer.

<<6068.48;6071.44;en>>
You see that on page 46.

<<6071.44;6073.7;en>>
There's a misprint in one of the submissions.

<<6073.7;6081.39;en>>
His name is Lieutenant Jim Hoft, H-O-E-F-T.

<<6081.39;6087.66;en>>
Of course, Georgia soon moved away from its pictures and video, just as Milern and Friend has done today.

<<6087.66;6101.5;en>>
And it prefers to rely on an official report of a Dutch investigative mission which investigated the death of Mr. Storeman's from late August 2008.

<<6101.5;6107.76;en>>
The Dutch investigative mission, or DIM, said that Georgia cooperated with the investigation.

<<6107.76;6116.47;en>>
But remarkably, at the evidential hearing, it turned out that the DIM investigators were not given access to missile pieces.

<<6116.47;6123.7;en>>
Instead, the DIM were apparently prepared to work only with pictures and video.

<<6123.7;6131.26;en>>
So the Dutch report is worth nothing more than the pictures and the video that you have before you.

<<6131.26;6140.16;en>>
It's also interesting to note that the Dutch attributed the sofa picture to the HALO Trust, a British demining charity.

<<6140.16;6147.97;en>>
In fact, as we've seen, the copyright belongs very clearly to the US State Department, or possibly the US Navy.

<<6147.97;6149.55;en>>
I'm sorry for its use.

<<6149.55;6164.18;en>>
In the absence of any hard evidence, primary evidence identifying an Iskander, the Dutch relied on three things as purported proof.

<<6164.18;6176.18;en>>
First was little bullets supposedly taken from the wall in Gori, and a little bullet taken from the body of Mr. Storeman's.

<<6176.18;6178.7;en>>
But that is hopeless, too.

<<6178.7;6185.78;en>>
First, we only see videos showing small holes from an Iskander after the US State Department arrived.

<<6185.78;6191.92;en>>
Page 64 is a still from one such video dated 27th of August 2008.

<<6191.92;6197.02;en>>
This rash of little holes is not there in the early pictures.

<<6197.02;6207.97;en>>
It's also qualitatively different from what Georgia now relies on, which looks to be spattered damage of some different weapon in relation to two or three buildings.

<<6207.97;6215.48;en>>
The devastation from an Iskander would have been across a massive area and almost total.

<<6215.48;6218.58;en>>
Now, Mr. Ackermans of RTL now says

<<6218.59;6226.18;en>>
in a statement produced nine years after the event that the taxi in the square was sprayed with little bullets from an Iskander.

<<6226.18;6229.32;en>>
Of course, that comes too late for cross-examination.

<<6229.32;6235.55;en>>
But it's very striking that there are no little holes in the taxi in the early pictures and video.

<<6235.55;6239.42;en>>
See pages 60 to 63.

<<6239.42;6246.06;en>>
Indeed, one of the court's own witnesses noted that the statue of Stalin had not any scratch on it.

<<6246.06;6251.14;en>>
I do assure you that a real Iskander missile would not have shown such cultural sensitivity.

<<6251.14;6263.12;en>>
Second, the Dutch relied on supposed common characteristics between the wall bullets and the little bullet taken from the body of Mr. Storemans.

<<6263.12;6266.4;en>>
But that is hopeless in terms of primary evidence.

<<6266.4;6269.06;en>>
If it's right, it only shows that the shrapnel is the same.

<<6269.06;6271.66;en>>
It doesn't show that it comes from an Iskander.

<<6271.66;6286.62;en>>
And if Georgia and its allies had Iskander shrapnel, what confidence can we have that the single fragment got into Mr. Storemans' body from an explosion on the 12th?

<<6286.62;6294.06;en>>
Instead, Georgia asserted at the evidential hearing that Mr. Storemans' body was taken directly

<<6294.06;6296.14;en>>
to Holland for an autopsy.

<<6296.14;6301.7;en>>
That's instead of any proof of chain of custody of the body.

<<6301.7;6304.58;en>>
But that assertion was untrue.

<<6304.59;6322.66;en>>
The autopsy occurred on the 19th of August, a full week later, and it's transpired from the report that when the body was examined, it had already been embalmed, sutured, and stitched by unknown persons, which the pathologist gave as a rather odd reason for not taking photographs.

<<6322.66;6326.73;en>>
See page 65 of the open exhibit.

<<6326.73;6335.74;en>>
Now, three weeks ago, and this is very interesting, Georgia tried to cure the odd absence of pictures of Mr. Storemans' body by producing its own.

<<6335.74;6346.55;en>>
One might have thought that these would be comprehensive, but they miss out the entry wound for the particle that is supposed to have killed Mr. Storemans.

<<6346.55;6353.94;en>>
They do include a very disturbing picture of Mr. Storemans' head, which shows a round hole

<<6353.94;6364.26;en>>
with no exit wound, and the intended message to this court is that this was another Iskander bullet that remained in his skull.

<<6364.26;6377.18;en>>
However, the devil is always in the detail, and please look at the tomography report, which is attached to the autopsy report at annex 4 to Russia's submission of the 24th of November.

<<6377.18;6385.68;en>>
It says that the fragments in the skull that caused the hole had a density lower than bone.

<<6385.68;6388.1;en>>
That means they were not metal.

<<6388.1;6399.98;en>>
They were absolutely not what the Dutch said Iskander bullets were made of, sintered tungsten with a very high density of 19.3 grams per cubic centimeter.

<<6399.98;6404.18;en>>
So whatever made the hole had nothing to do with an Iskander.

<<6404.18;6406.1;en>>
I can't tell you what did.

<<6406.1;6409.42;en>>
Georgia is better placed.

<<6409.42;6419.94;en>>
Going back to the Dutch investigation report, the last thing that the Dutch relied on, and my learned friend relies on now, is numbers on missile parts.

<<6419.94;6421.14;en>>
Three points.

<<6421.14;6429.3;en>>
First, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, these numbers don't belong to any missile that's ever been in the Russian inventory.

<<6429.3;6436.7;en>>
Second, the missile comes down so fast that paint burns from friction, so the numbers would have burned off.

<<6436.7;6443.74;en>>
And third, the green numbered piece on which Reliance is placed appears to be hand-painted.

<<6443.74;6448.62;en>>
That's page 69 of the open exhibit.

<<6448.62;6456.55;en>>
So this ultra-modern, class-leading missile, a world leader, is hand-painted.

<<6456.55;6461.86;en>>
Unsurprisingly, that doesn't correspond to Russian military manufacture.

<<6461.86;6463.18;en>>
The short point is this.

<<6463.18;6468.98;en>>
Georgia's case came down to video and pictures that have been shown to be false.

<<6468.98;6474.12;en>>
And they also don't correspond with reality or physics.

<<6474.12;6480.47;en>>
The factors ignored by the Dutch investigators are at page 57 of the open exhibit.

<<6480.47;6483.58;en>>
But please just look at the pictures yourselves.

<<6483.58;6491.74;en>>
The best pictures show pieces of missile lying gently on a sofa or nestled on grass.

<<6491.74;6497.18;en>>
This is not hundreds of kilograms coming down vertically at massive speed.

<<6497.18;6508.14;en>>
The nose cone of the missile, which weighs also hundreds of kilograms, leaves a dimple on the tarmac in the square.

<<6508.14;6509.98;en>>
And the ballast piece is bent over.

<<6509.98;6513.9;en>>
So from some angles, it looks as though it's sitting.

<<6513.9;6515.74;en>>
It's embedded in the tarmac.

<<6515.74;6518.74;en>>
But actually, it's just sitting on it.

<<6518.74;6524.98;en>>
Now, we've had more pictures, Reuters quality I've referred to.

<<6524.98;6526.64;en>>
But there are mistakes even in that.

<<6526.64;6540.1;en>>
If you compare pages 52 and 53 of the exhibit, you see that at this quality, we've got two versions of one section of the missile, one with a silver seam.

<<6540.1;6544.62;en>>
Obviously, one of the artists thought that that was a little bit more convincing.

<<6544.62;6552.55;en>>
Unfortunately, so many people are employed doing this that evidently some don't know what the others are doing.

<<6552.55;6562.74;en>>
Now, the object of George's further photographic and video evidence is to try to show that the attack happened on the 12th of August.

<<6562.74;6566.06;en>>
But we've got a Russian forensic report.

<<6566.06;6574.0;en>>
And that makes plain what we all know, that in metadata, the most malleable and unreliable thing is the date.

<<6574.0;6580.82;en>>
We can all give a photograph any date by resetting the date on the camera or the phone or whatever.

<<6580.82;6588.02;en>>
But even so, if the Georgian data is true, some interesting revelations follow.

<<6588.02;6601.34;en>>
Three of the most important pictures showing parts of the missile supposedly in place after the attack show on their face an orange date of the 12th of August.

<<6601.34;6604.14;en>>
But the metadata says 15th of August.

<<6604.14;6610.9;en>>
That's annex 8, pictures 5, 11, and 12 to George's November submissions.

<<6610.9;6619.3;en>>
And note also page 17 of the Manukarian report, the Russian forensic report.

<<6619.3;6631.58;en>>
It shows that the metadata of one of the main square videos, entitled gory central square after bombing, was created on the 11th of August, the day before the alleged attacks.

<<6631.58;6637.1;en>>
So we simply can't trust the dates and McLernand-Friends chronology.

<<6637.1;6641.02;en>>
What we can trust is common sense and physics.

<<6641.02;6648.82;en>>
And with respect, there's no answer to Isaac Newton in McLernand-Friends case.

<<6648.82;6653.86;en>>
We've got some new evidence from the supposed owner of the flat where the missile landed on the sofa.

<<6653.86;6659.62;en>>
And it's supposed to have bounced off the wall and knocked over the television before landing on the sofa.

<<6659.62;6663.62;en>>
And that slowed it down, which is why it didn't demolish the entire building.

<<6663.62;6667.74;en>>
Well, that's perhaps a great advertisement for Georgian televisions and furniture.

<<6667.74;6672.47;en>>
But it's got nothing to do with any convincing evidence before this court.

<<6672.47;6681.06;en>>
And when McLernand-Friends makes accusations of presenting false evidence, Georgia has had these points for a long time.

<<6681.06;6685.34;en>>
It has come before you today with no answer to them.

<<6685.34;6694.62;en>>
And it has the temerity to suggest that false evidence has been put forward on the Russian side.

<<6694.62;6703.34;en>>
Now, one interesting development three weeks ago is an offer by Georgia to allow inspection of all of the missile pieces.

<<6703.34;6708.84;en>>
It's accompanied by a heavily redacted diplomatic note from America.

<<6708.84;6717.51;en>>
That says that the missile parts were received from Georgia in several shipments beginning in August 2008.

<<6717.51;6730.42;en>>
But 10 years after the event, it's impossible to know how many trips these parts have undertaken, in which direction, and it's impossible to know where they came from in the first place.

<<6730.42;6739.06;en>>
And the fundamental problem for Georgia is page 50 of the open exhibit, which we went through at the evidential hearing and to which there's no answer.

<<6739.06;6750.3;en>>
If these pieces did come from an Iskander and they were genuinely found where they claimed to have been found, why was it necessary to fake this video?

<<6750.3;6768.14;en>>
On provenance, we know nothing in terms of these new parts put forward, save that the Russian Ministry of Defense has confirmed that the test sites for Iskander missiles, which stretch over thousands of square kilometers, are not secure.

<<6768.14;6774.34;en>>
So perhaps the United States, having helped in so many ways, is helping again.

<<6774.34;6782.62;en>>
The truth is that Georgia knows that its Iskander case is hopeless, and it's admitted as much by its latest conduct.

<<6782.62;6794.47;en>>
Almost three weeks ago, at the end of April, barely three weeks ago, it tried to delay this hearing by shunting off the Iskander issue to the prosecutor's office of the International Criminal Court.

<<6794.47;6798.76;en>>
And Georgia asked for an adjournment that was rightly refused.

<<6798.76;6816.78;en>>
But it's striking that in the correspondence presented, the ICC prosecutor has asked for the actual missile parts and essential evidence like the chain of custody of the parts, precisely what Georgia has failed to begin to prove, in this case, before this court.

<<6816.78;6824.02;en>>
And for completeness, Georgia has produced seismographs three weeks ago, alleged to show an Iskander attack.

<<6824.02;6827.1;en>>
We haven't had time to examine those properly.

<<6827.1;6834.58;en>>
But given the artistry applied to radar plots, there's no reason for any confidence that these reflect reality.

<<6834.59;6841.59;en>>
With respect, it should not be necessary to examine this further material now, because it comes too late.

<<6841.59;6851.14;en>>
It's not Russia's fault, and it's not the court's fault, that Georgia has failed to prove its case with appropriate primary evidence at a proper time.

<<6851.14;6860.39;en>>
It shouldn't have relied on fake evidence in the first place, and it should have presented its evidence somewhat earlier during the past 10 years.

<<6860.39;6864.74;en>>
I'll refer very briefly to Georgia's other evidence at the evidential hearing.

<<6864.74;6868.86;en>>
In summary, some involved false witnesses.

<<6868.86;6877.9;en>>
Some involved witnesses who may very well have suffered in tragic ways, for example, because of an explosion.

<<6877.9;6885.62;en>>
But whilst one can be confident that there was suffering, there was not evidence about which side caused it.

<<6885.62;6903.74;en>>
And when it comes to explosions, and you've heard the evidence admitted by Human Rights Watch that Georgia fired cluster missiles on Georgian villages and blamed that on Russia, there can be no confidence in Georgia's current case that Russia was responsible.

<<6903.74;6911.02;en>>
The weakest part of Georgia's case was attempts to implicate Russian soldiers in alleged abuse.

<<6911.02;6913.2;en>>
And it was plainly coached.

<<6913.2;6923.62;en>>
For example, witness 19, a female witness, claimed to be a civilian detainee, and she alleged the repeated rape of another female detainee.

<<6923.62;6927.48;en>>
And she tried to implicate a Russian officer.

<<6927.48;6930.55;en>>
But the victim had made her own complaint.

<<6930.55;6939.52;en>>
And in it, she said that she was raped by Ossetians before being taken into protective custody, and she did not blame Russians.

<<6939.52;6950.06;en>>
Her statement, which Georgia evidently forgot about, was at annex 460 to Georgia's observations on the merits dated 5th of March, 2015.

<<6950.06;6953.58;en>>
Another example concerned POWs.

<<6953.58;6958.02;en>>
They told a terrible story about one of their number being executed.

<<6958.02;6962.05;en>>
And again, there were efforts to implicate Russian soldiers.

<<6962.05;6974.78;en>>
But the witnesses presented at the hearing could not agree on numerous details of the alleged hearing, including whether they were forced to bury the body or not.

<<6974.78;6977.47;en>>
Really fundamental points.

<<6977.47;6988.47;en>>
And moreover, the accounts given earlier to Amnesty International, which seemed to relate to this incident, there's only one like it, blamed Ossetians and not Russians.

<<6988.47;6995.9;en>>
And according to Amnesty, when they reached Russian custody, the POWs received proper medical treatment.

<<6995.9;6999.86;en>>
That's page 103 of the open exhibit.

<<6999.86;7005.2;en>>
Nothing in Georgia's latest material changes that. Annex 26 is falsely

<<7005.2;7008.82;en>>
described as supporting abuse of POWs.

<<7008.82;7010.55;en>>
Please look at that material.

<<7010.55;7022.82;en>>
The misdescription of it is another admission by conduct that Georgia doesn't have proper evidence, convincing evidence of Russian involvement in any abuse.

<<7022.82;7033.9;en>>
In relation to alleged organized destruction of Georgian villages after the conflict, Georgia tried to rely on NASA and the Collection 5 algorithm.

<<7033.9;7036.76;en>>
You have an expert report on that.

<<7036.76;7046.62;en>>
The important point is that in a test in Europe with a known fire at Sloka in Latvia, it produced three false positives and only one correct positive.

<<7046.62;7052.1;en>>
And two of the false positives had confidence levels at 90% and 100%.

<<7052.1;7062.55;en>>
And also, where it says there's a fire, it identifies an area of 1 kilometer by 1 kilometer as on fire with those false positives around.

<<7062.55;7067.44;en>>
So what's presented as sequential destruction of villages was not.

<<7067.44;7074.9;en>>
The evidence is quite clear that there were repeated criminal attacks.

<<7074.9;7089.22;en>>
And as to that, it's important, when one thinks about effective control, to consider what that needs to mean in a case like this to attach any responsibility to Russia.

<<7089.22;7094.74;en>>
You can't just adopt with respect a formulaic approach that there were lots of Russian soldiers.

<<7094.74;7099.58;en>>
They were fully occupied, facing rather more Georgian soldiers.

<<7099.58;7104.42;en>>
The highest number we've established on the Russian side is 4,901.

<<7104.42;7116.31;en>>
Georgia deployed 17,000 troops, 100 tanks, hundreds of artillery systems, and even after Georgia fell back after the initial conflict, they were trying to regroup.

<<7116.31;7125.58;en>>
America flew 2,000 crack troops back from the Middle East, and Georgia tried to mobilize its entire reserve of 45,000 men.

<<7125.58;7134.86;en>>
So the Russian troops, dealing with a conflict not of their choosing, at a time not of their choosing, could not control everything behind their lines.

<<7134.86;7137.9;en>>
They were rather busy looking forwards.

<<7137.9;7141.34;en>>
But they did try.

<<7141.34;7143.94;en>>
Russia tried to prevent these attacks.

<<7143.94;7150.98;en>>
You've got evidence of that, including from NGOs at pages 93 onwards of the open exhibit.

<<7150.98;7154.39;en>>
It's on the professionalism of Russian soldiers.

<<7154.39;7163.98;en>>
Witness 30 explained the roving patrols that were set up to try to respond to cases of attack and arson.

<<7163.98;7171.34;en>>
And at the evidential hearing, there was explanation for Witnesses 28 and 30 of the difficulties faced.

<<7171.34;7188.34;en>>
150 villages, 200, if you count, smaller settlements, each with many routes of approach over land that was mountainous, with lots of groves and vegetation and twisted lanes, as it was put.

<<7188.34;7194.47;en>>
Please note the evidence of Witness 28, a peacekeeper, who described the problems they faced.

<<7194.47;7197.18;en>>
He said any case of arson was investigated.

<<7197.18;7199.5;en>>
A patrol group was four or five people.

<<7199.5;7202.02;en>>
When we saw flames, we would go to the house.

<<7202.02;7205.9;en>>
But all we could do was just take note that the house had been set fire to.

<<7205.9;7207.78;en>>
We didn't see the arsonists.

<<7207.78;7212.47;en>>
The arson tended to happen in the evening or at night.

<<7212.47;7220.5;en>>
And even Georgian witnesses accepted that these criminal attacks were attacks on Ossetians, too.

<<7220.5;7225.39;en>>
See Witness 24 at page 265 of 423.

<<7225.39;7239.5;en>>
And you also have in the open exhibit, page 101, a recorded interview with an Ossetian family who protested to looters that they were Ossetian, and that did them no good.

<<7239.5;7244.26;en>>
They were robbed and the house pillaged as well.

<<7244.26;7256.66;en>>
Now, because of these difficulties on the facts, he can't prove effective control in any meaningful sense, which means the ability to stop these attacks.

<<7256.66;7270.5;en>>
So Melenifren tries to do it in a thoroughly legalistic way on the basis that Russia supported the governments of Ossetia and Abkhazia and is somehow strictly liable for all that happened there.

<<7270.5;7274.42;en>>
But that should be hopeless before this court.

<<7274.42;7280.74;en>>
Russia intervened to protect its peacekeepers and Russian citizens and to neutralize the threat against them.

<<7280.74;7284.9;en>>
It did not support the Ossetian and Abkhazian governments during the conflict.

<<7284.9;7294.59;en>>
Rather, they were incidental beneficiaries of Russia's entirely justified protection of its own peacekeepers and nationals.

<<7294.59;7306.31;en>>
Second, as regards continuing economic support, we're helped on this by some jurisprudence after the written submissions on this point were prepared.

<<7306.31;7317.1;en>>
In the Moser case in 2016, the grand chamber explained the rationale behind the Elasku line of cases, which you've seen is Melenifren's tabula in naufragium.

<<7319.82;7340.07;en>>
At paragraph 110 in Moser, the court held that the MRT is only able to continue to exist and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region because of Russian military, economic, and political support.

<<7340.07;7348.59;en>>
The same point is made in Apkov and Moldova, paragraph 23, a decision of May 2017.

<<7348.59;7364.26;en>>
So in order to find that an outside state has effective control on the Elasku line, it must have excluded efforts by another government to restore democracy and the rule of law.

<<7364.26;7372.86;en>>
Please look again at pages 8 to 12 of the open exhibit.

<<7372.86;7380.7;en>>
Georgia was not trying to restore democracy and the rule of law in South Ossetia.

<<7380.7;7390.39;en>>
Georgia was raining death and destruction on the civilian population of a sleeping city in total disregard of the convention.

<<7390.39;7394.62;en>>
And moreover, as Mr. Galperin has noted, it's failed

<<7394.62;7398.34;en>>
to renounce violence even now.

<<7398.34;7410.55;en>>
The court has, with respect, clear evidence of what would happen if support were withdrawn and if Russia did not assist with the policing of borders.

<<7410.55;7414.86;en>>
Georgia attacked with ruthless force civilians in 1992.

<<7414.86;7417.47;en>>
It did so again in 2008.

<<7417.47;7432.94;en>>
It follows that it would be quite wrong for this court to impose any kind of strict liability on Russia for supporting the governments of South Ossetia without regard to the likely humanitarian cost if that support were withdrawn.

<<7432.94;7442.06;en>>
And in any event, Mlenod-Frend uses Elasku to try to confuse and conflate the issue of attribution.

<<7442.06;7451.86;en>>
On the clear evidence before you, including NGO reports, the perpetrators of attacks on both Ossetians and Georgians were criminals.

<<7451.86;7455.66;en>>
Criminals are not state agents.

<<7455.66;7459.7;en>>
On clear evidence, Russian forces tried to stop them.

<<7459.7;7466.94;en>>
And it follows in attribution terms that Russia bears no responsibility for alleged criminal abuses by Ossetians.

<<7466.94;7485.24;en>>
Indeed, with respect, it would be utterly absurd to hold Russia responsible for criminality that Georgia brought about by destroying civil society in Tskhinvali and criminality which Russia tried to prevent.

<<7485.24;7489.23;en>>
That would be perverse logic indeed.

<<7489.23;7492.62;en>>
The court has asked about whether it should deal with IHL.

<<7492.62;7497.26;en>>
And our reasons for saying no are set in writing.

<<7497.26;7501.74;en>>
International humanitarian law is inconsistent with human rights law.

<<7501.74;7505.51;en>>
And I repeat Mr. Galperin's observation

<<7505.51;7510.15;en>>
that the rules of IHL are important for commanders in the field.

<<7510.15;7527.42;en>>
And the cost may be high if they cease to be universal, if they are melded into different complementary regimes by different human rights tribunals around the world, and if commanders don't know what to do clearly on the spot.

<<7527.42;7529.66;en>>
Why should you not deal with IHL?

<<7529.66;7532.9;en>>
Well, this case, with respect, is a prime example.

<<7532.9;7538.26;en>>
The Evidential Commission saw material released by Edward Snowden.

<<7538.26;7550.39;en>>
It included training slides to security services of America and Britain showing how to produce false news and fake evidence for the purposes of information operations.

<<7550.39;7554.62;en>>
And you've got those, some of them, at pages 77 to 85.

<<7554.62;7560.34;en>>
And you've got those, some of them, at pages 77 to 84 of the open exhibit.

<<7560.34;7573.66;en>>
The methods include fake pictures and video, putting them on the internet through social media accounts, and then spinning that into received fact into the mainstream media.

<<7573.66;7577.9;en>>
But that supposedly received fact can be false.

<<7577.9;7587.1;en>>
And please finally bear in mind evidence from the court's own expert at the evidential hearing who was cross-examined on that material.

<<7587.1;7594.58;en>>
Again, I can't name him, but Witness 35 was a very experienced man who was very well placed to know.

<<7594.58;7601.7;en>>
And he said this about the deployment of fake video and pictures instead of primary evidence.

<<7601.7;7607.22;en>>
It's a contemporary flaw, in my view, of what happens, yes.

<<7607.23;7610.59;en>>
Also used to great effect, I may say.

<<7613.31;7623.55;en>>
The resources deployed in that fakery are huge, hundreds of operatives and hundreds of millions of dollars.

<<7623.55;7633.58;en>>
And they're rather larger than the resources of this court, with an evidence hearing with 15 minutes per witness, to challenge.

<<7633.58;7644.58;en>>
This court can't hope to see through the fog of war or deliberate smoke screens, as they've been thrown up by the Georgian side.

<<7644.58;7654.39;en>>
And it has no power to delegate to NGOs, which can be compromised or misled, as we've seen in this case.

<<7654.39;7665.1;en>>
Nor can it delegate to Dutch investigative missions, however much assistance they may have received from former employees of American intelligence services.

<<7665.1;7671.62;en>>
And it's clear from the confidential transcript that Mr. Garlasgo worked closely with the Dutch mission.

<<7677.36;7682.59;en>>
There is no basis for the charges put against Russia.

<<7682.59;7687.86;en>>
There is no convincing evidence to support them.

<<7687.86;7694.15;en>>
And this case is not put forward to serve the convention.

<<7694.15;7706.62;en>>
It's put forward in quite a cynical way, which would undermine the convention if Melenad Frenz succeeded in taking the court beyond its jurisdiction.

<<7706.62;7712.39;en>>
I would finally urge that the court should not accede to that.

<<7712.39;7719.42;en>>
And it should avoid getting in the way of real working life on the ground.

<<7719.42;7719.42;en>>
That is my suggestion.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<7721.64;7724.44;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Swainston.

<<7724.44;7728.09;en>>
I thank both parties for their submissions.

<<7728.09;7737.28;en>>
And now I invite my colleagues, members of the Grand Chamber, who wish to do so, to put their questions to the parties.

<<7737.28;7739.68;en>>
Are there questions?

<<7740.88;7754.68;en>>
This does not seem to be the case, so the Court will now withdraw for 20 minutes, following which the parties will be able to submit brief observations in reply to each other's submissions.

<<7754.68;7757.48;en>>
And so the hearing is suspended.

La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<8496.87;8498.07;en>>
Please be seated.

<<8507.75;8509.39;en>>
The hearing is resumed.

<<8509.39;8511.39;en>>
And I call Mr. Emmerson, please, to the floor.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<8512.49;8515.61;en>>
Mr. President, the way I propose to structure this reply

<<8515.61;8525.73;en>>
is to deal with a number of points quite shortly and in relevant order, having looked at the overall position.

<<8525.73;8538.17;en>>
Can I just say, overall, now you have seen for yourselves the quality of the Russian response.

<<8538.17;8554.69;en>>
You have seen for yourselves the process of tortuous twisting, the paranoid ramblings about CIA stealing weapons or making up planted scenes.

<<8554.69;8571.29;en>>
You have seen for yourself all the absurdity, which is a way to hide behind the fact that Russia has failed to address the issues, has failed to acknowledge its own military strategy, or provide any explanation for it.

<<8571.29;8580.21;en>>
Instead, it's all about whether or not somebody's mother or the local village mayor was the man or the woman.

<<8580.21;8582.85;en>>
I mean, it's that sort of level.

<<8582.85;8584.73;en>>
This is blatant.

<<8584.73;8585.33;en>>
It's obvious.

<<8585.33;8587.97;en>>
It's quite characteristic.

<<8587.97;8594.33;en>>
Essentially, the aim here is to generate as much dust as possible.

<<8594.33;8611.93;en>>
And after that, I hope that that will obscure the court's ability to see the truth that the rest of the world is known as fact for 10 years, and thereby camouflage the reality from scrutiny, and then complain about the fog of war.

<<8611.93;8615.69;en>>
That's the strategy.

<<8615.69;8617.37;en>>
Let me just take an example.

<<8617.37;8622.89;en>>
So we have from Mr. Swainston a remarkable performance

<<8622.89;8629.17;en>>
of expert evidence from him about the physics of an Iskander missile.

<<8629.17;8632.61;en>>
Now, no expert evidence whatsoever.

<<8632.61;8638.53;en>>
They've had years and years and years to produce that via an evidential form.

<<8638.53;8643.25;en>>
Instead, Mr. Swainston gives evidence to you

<<8643.25;8647.21;en>>
about what he thinks Isaac Newton would have said.

<<8647.21;8651.41;en>>
Now, if there really was an answer to these allegations, you would have heard it.

<<8651.41;8655.69;en>>
This is advocacy posing as evidence.

<<8655.69;8666.65;en>>
And I'm sure it doesn't take me to point out not just the silliness of it, but the fact that it doesn't properly respect the intelligence of this court the whole way it's been handled.

<<8666.65;8668.81;en>>
I mean, it comes down to this.

<<8668.81;8673.09;en>>
The Iskander is characteristic and typical of the issues in the case.

<<8673.09;8685.85;en>>
And as far as Russia's concerned, either it's plywood, or if it's not plywood, it was nicked by the CIA, stolen by the CIA from an insecure store, and then broken apart and planted by the Russians.

<<8685.85;8692.57;en>>
Some of the Americans working with the Georgians, bits of it were somehow inserted into the flesh of Mr. Storobin.

<<8692.57;8695.41;en>>
I mean, it's really at that level.

<<8695.41;8704.59;en>>
It's hard, I think, to believe that a council of your member of state would embarrass this institution with those kinds of submissions.

<<8704.59;8706.69;en>>
But that's the way it is.

<<8706.69;8717.29;en>>
It's obfuscation and confabulation in an attempt to try to prevent you from doing your duty.

<<8717.29;8719.97;en>>
Let me deal with some of the specifics.

<<8719.97;8726.45;en>>
First of all, another aspect of the obfuscation, both from the minister and from Mr. Swainston,

<<8726.45;8731.69;en>>
is to start saying, but the Georgians attacked Skindvali.

<<8731.69;8735.77;en>>
Or the Georgians did this, or attacked civilians.

<<8735.77;8741.69;en>>
Either back in 1992 or in 2008.

<<8741.69;8745.57;en>>
So this was an issue that came up at the evidential hearing.

<<8745.57;8753.01;en>>
Because you will appreciate that it goes without saying, this is not a just ad bellum case.

<<8753.01;8756.73;en>>
This is not a case about the legality of war.

<<8756.73;8758.77;en>>
This is a just in bello case.

<<8758.77;8763.65;en>>
This is a case about how you wage war once it's begun.

<<8763.65;8769.33;en>>
And there is no determination of who was right to start or who was wrong to start, or any of that kind of thing.

<<8769.33;8782.57;en>>
And there has been no evidence about how the Skindvali incident occurred, or the chronology of attacks on either side.

<<8782.57;8787.53;en>>
What we know is that it's outside the scope of this case.

<<8787.53;8790.29;en>>
And that's why there is no evidence about it.

<<8790.29;8802.53;en>>
And it was excluded, all references to it were excluded by the presidents, or by the presidents of the fact-finding delegation during the oral hearing.

<<8802.53;8803.61;en>>
So that's one point.

<<8803.61;8806.63;en>>
The other point is, so Mr. Swainston

<<8806.63;8809.59;en>>
says this is a monstrous crime.

<<8809.59;8817.65;en>>
Not only is it outside the scope, because this is concerned with the manner of waging conflict, but there's been no counterclaim.

<<8817.65;8827.25;en>>
It was open to the Russian side to put it within scope if they thought there had been violations of the convention for which they could show Georgian responsibility.

<<8827.25;8829.61;en>>
But they chose not to do that.

<<8829.61;8838.93;en>>
And they cannot now make unsubstantiated submissions and invite you to draw conclusions about something that's A, outside scope, and B, has been deliberately excluded from the evidence.

<<8838.93;8840.37;en>>
It's a completely wrong approach.

<<8840.37;8842.95;en>>
But again, don't play the ball.

<<8842.95;8844.33;en>>
Play the man.

<<8844.33;8850.47;en>>
Keep to distract the court as much as possible for issues that are not relevant to the question of Russian state responsibility.

<<8850.47;8856.93;en>>
And hopefully, we might avoid the inevitable.

<<8856.93;8862.17;en>>
The same is true of the repeated allegations about Georgian cluster munitions.

<<8862.17;8864.73;en>>
Mr. Swainston was giving evidence to you.

<<8864.73;8871.89;en>>
There is no evidence at all that the Georgian side was responsible for bombing its own citizens.

<<8871.89;8873.89;en>>
He's made that up.

<<8873.89;8883.69;en>>
And he hopes that by twisting a footnote from a Human Rights Watch report, which is unverified anyway, it's just a factual footnote.

<<8883.69;8893.29;en>>
And then he says, and of course, probably those witnesses who gave Human Rights Watch an inaccurate account in the fog of war, they must have been put up by the Georgian government.

<<8893.29;8895.89;en>>
Therefore, it's all a framed case.

<<8895.89;8898.09;en>>
That's what he said to you.

<<8898.09;8899.73;en>>
No evidence for any of this at all.

<<8899.73;8902.93;en>>
It's just pure winging it.

<<8902.93;8909.01;en>>
And it's disappointing.

<<8909.01;8911.05;en>>
Substantive issues.

<<8911.05;8920.33;en>>
Reference was made to Bankovic in relation to the area of control.

<<8920.33;8922.61;en>>
I want to just make two quick points.

<<8922.61;8924.43;en>>
I think they're self-evident.

<<8924.43;8935.65;en>>
Obviously, in this case, unlike in Bankovic, we were concerned with two Council of Europe member states and an entire conflict which occurs within the Espace Juridique of the convention.

<<8935.65;8950.29;en>>
But more importantly, here, control is exercised by a combined military operation, which is both taking place in the air and taking place simultaneously on the ground.

<<8950.29;8954.93;en>>
The air cover weakens the enemy and allows the ground troops to move forward.

<<8954.93;8959.25;en>>
The ground troops move forward and take possession of areas under their control.

<<8959.25;8976.73;en>>
And it's in that point, with the Russians on the ground and circling the area, that their jets then circle backwards and drop their loads across Erevti and the other villages.

<<8976.73;8982.81;en>>
So you can't separate out the control on the air and the control on the ground.

<<8982.81;8985.07;en>>
They're part of the same military strategy.

<<8985.07;8995.33;en>>
And as we said before, Russia had absolute control in the air, and it had de facto absolute control on the ground as well.

<<8995.33;9009.69;en>>
Either, and certainly both, are sufficient to establish the Al-Skyni second head of extraterritorial applicability under Article 1.

<<9009.69;9040.93;en>>
Next, I wanted to touch upon the IHL-IHRL argument, the notion that it's not appropriate for this court to be examining international humanitarian law, even though the International Court of Justice and every other relevant tribunal has held that human rights treaties remain in force but must be interpreted and shaped through the prism of humanitarian law in times of armed conflict.

<<9040.93;9046.17;en>>
But it's not a difficult overmapping exercise in this case at all.

<<9046.17;9048.77;en>>
That is a false.

<<9048.77;9051.37;en>>
It's what we call in England Aunt Sally.

<<9051.37;9053.73;en>>
It's been put up to knock it down.

<<9053.73;9063.97;en>>
It's an unsound basis for the submission that there is something complicated.

<<9063.97;9068.93;en>>
It's had to be so complicated that even lawyers can't understand it.

<<9068.93;9074.21;en>>
And you can't heaven-forfend expect military commanders to understand it.

<<9074.21;9082.57;en>>
Well, first of all, military commanders are expected to understand the requirements of humanitarian law and to give effect to them.

<<9082.57;9096.13;en>>
It's an absolute basic requirement of state responsibility that education and conformability with international humanitarian law is a duty resting on commanders.

<<9096.13;9118.11;en>>
And there's nothing very complicated about knowing that you mustn't shoot an unarmed civilian, or you mustn't set fire to the house of somebody that you've just detained, or you mustn't drop bombs on a church or a town square, or you mustn't pull the teeth of a prisoner of war out with pliers.

<<9118.11;9120.85;en>>
I don't think it's very complicated.

<<9120.85;9123.63;en>>
I don't think this court would find it very complicated.

<<9123.63;9125.57;en>>
It's a simple exercise.

<<9125.57;9138.73;en>>
And if one goes through each violation, there really is absolutely nowhere where there is any significant divergence between the Convention's standards and the standards of humanitarian law.

<<9138.73;9141.09;en>>
And you wouldn't expect there to be.

<<9141.09;9148.01;en>>
That would be the case if Russia were saying, yes, we did bomb that village.

<<9148.01;9152.01;en>>
And we bombed it because there was a military target right in the middle.

<<9152.01;9155.93;en>>
And we know that the civilians were going to get killed.

<<9155.93;9167.13;en>>
But we took a view that that was such a high-value military target that there was a proportionality, an acceptable level of civilian casualties as collateral damage.

<<9167.13;9170.53;en>>
And then it would be a proportionality analysis.

<<9170.53;9180.93;en>>
But we're not in that decision because their strategy has been to deny and obfuscate and throw as much confusion as they hope that they can.

<<9180.93;9182.13;en>>
So that's the first.

<<9182.13;9184.05;en>>
Those are the sort of short scattergun points.

<<9184.05;9186.61;en>>
I want to make three final points, if I may.

<<9186.61;9203.53;en>>
First of all, the nonsense that Russia was somehow neutral and that the South Ossetians, let's take them for example, were the innocent beneficiaries of an attempt to safeguard Russian civilians.

<<9203.53;9208.97;en>>
As you know, we say, and the evidence proves that that is a lie.

<<9208.97;9222.85;en>>
That Russia has been progressively occupying and exercising control over the administrations in the two regions over a period of decades that it had established its own laws, its own currency.

<<9222.85;9226.45;en>>
It was taking over over time.

<<9226.45;9238.61;en>>
But if there's any doubt about this, if there's any doubt about it, let me read you a statement by Edward Kokoyte, who was the separatist leader of South Ossetia.

<<9238.61;9244.65;en>>
And he's speaking in June 2006, two years before the war.

<<9244.65;9253.17;en>>
He says this, South Ossetia is already a de facto subject of Russia.

<<9253.17;9260.85;en>>
95% of citizens of the Republic of South Ossetia are citizens of the Russian Federation.

<<9260.85;9266.93;en>>
On the territory of the Republic of South Ossetia are Russian laws.

<<9266.93;9273.25;en>>
On the territory of the Republic of South Ossetia, the monetary unit is the Russian ruble.

<<9273.25;9281.53;en>>
Criminal procedural codes of the Russian Federation are in effect on the territory of South Ossetia.

<<9281.53;9287.41;en>>
De facto, he said, South Ossetia is a subject of Russia.

<<9287.41;9292.85;en>>
What is left for us is to fix this in legal terms.

<<9292.85;9301.97;en>>
That was the leader of the South Ossetians in 2006.

<<9301.97;9329.13;en>>
It's an absolute distraction strategy to suggest to you that Russia was doing anything other than giving effect to a progressive plan, long held and put into effect, in order to do, as Mr. Kokoyte put it, ensure that we fix the legal position

<<9329.13;9334.21;en>>
by effectively annexing South Ossetia.

<<9334.21;9342.17;en>>
We didn't, neither side made any issue about exhaustion of domestic remedies, and the court hasn't asked a question.

<<9342.17;9346.57;en>>
But may I simply say two words, if I can?

<<9346.57;9362.13;en>>
First of all, our principal submission is that on the facts of this case, there could have been no requirement to exhaust any domestic remedies purportedly available in the Russian legal system, where an administrative practice is officially tolerated.

<<9362.13;9370.85;en>>
And of course, in an interstate case, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies that are purely theoretical and illusory.

<<9370.85;9376.05;en>>
The pattern of violations here, we say, was more than just officially tolerated.

<<9376.05;9378.37;en>>
It was itself state policy.

<<9378.37;9381.77;en>>
It was an ethnic cleansing strategy.

<<9381.77;9388.61;en>>
So we say that proposition is axiomatic and should be an end to any talk of non-exhaustion.

<<9388.61;9398.01;en>>
But we would just draw the court's attention to just two specific aspects, which would demonstrate the pointlessness of having recourse to Russian remedies.

<<9398.01;9418.89;en>>
First, the total passivity of the Russian authorities in the face of these violations, and the evident bias of the Russian investigating authorities in refusing to investigate crimes that were committed by Russian military personnel and their delegates in the de facto militias.

<<9418.89;9422.05;en>>
There simply isn't any investigation at all.

<<9422.05;9435.17;en>>
Where is the evidence that these crimes, undoubtedly committed on a wide scale, were investigated ex proprio motu, or that there have been reasonable and credible numbers of prosecutions?

<<9435.17;9437.01;en>>
If there had been, you would know about it.

<<9437.01;9438.09;en>>
There haven't been.

<<9438.09;9448.61;en>>
That's because the Russian approach is to close its mind to the possibility of accountability for these systematic human rights violations.

<<9448.61;9462.05;en>>
The investigative committee of the Russian prosecutor's office, which was referred to, initiated investigations only into allegations made against Georgian service personnel.

<<9462.05;9483.61;en>>
And the conduct of this office, which is dealt with in detail in our pleadings, demonstrates beyond doubt that it acted then and continues to act as a political tool of the Kremlin and the Russian authorities, rather than, in any sense, an independent and impartial investigative mechanism.

<<9483.61;9495.21;en>>
The second aspect that I just want to touch on is Russia's continued unwavering military, political, and economic support for the de facto authorities to the present day.

<<9495.21;9496.29;en>>
What does this show?

<<9496.29;9498.37;en>>
How is it relevant to exhaustion?

<<9498.37;9524.21;en>>
Well, it shows that in failing to prevent or to punish these war crimes, Russia itself has adopted a stance of official tolerance, not just to the crimes committed or connived in by its own officials, but also those committed or connived in by the militias and marauding hordes that were let loose by Russia on Georgian civilians.

<<9524.21;9531.41;en>>
So we ask you to find that that is the answer to the non-exhaustion issue.

<<9531.41;9537.63;en>>
The point has been most recently underlined by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.

<<9537.63;9550.73;en>>
In a submission to the ICC in October of 2015, the prosecutor addressed pretty much the same violations as those which are alleged in the present proceedings.

<<9550.73;9565.97;en>>
And her conclusion, and I quote, was that, as far as Russia is concerned, no concrete and progressive steps have been taken in Russia to ascertain the criminal responsibility of those involved in the alleged crimes.

<<9565.97;9581.69;en>>
So that is the office of the prosecutor concluding three years ago, so seven years after the events, that Russia has done nothing to investigate the crimes committed either by its own officials or by the South Ossetians.

<<9581.69;9596.63;en>>
And clearly, it goes without saying, I should imagine, that any remedies theoretically available in South Ossetia are of no value whatsoever, because it's not possible for the Georgian victims to even cross the boundary into South Ossetia.

<<9596.63;9600.49;en>>
They are excluded entirely.

<<9600.49;9606.61;en>>
Mr. President, may I just say this in wrapping up?

<<9606.61;9619.13;en>>
This litigation represents a significant challenge for the court and a test of its unimpeachable reputation for independence from political interference.

<<9619.13;9634.93;en>>
It's an open secret that Russia has been lobbying in public and in private for a favorable outcome, mumbling dark threats that it will de-ratify the convention and starve the court of funding if the case goes against it.

<<9634.93;9647.37;en>>
It seems the Kremlin hopes somehow to pressurize the court into a ruling that flies in the face of the evidence, or at least to bolt together some face-saving judgment of Solomon.

<<9647.37;9662.25;en>>
And if that is indeed their political calculation, then they are reckoning without this court's well-deserved reputation for fearless and objective adjudication, regardless of the political consequences.

<<9662.25;9666.17;en>>
There is no middle ground in adjudicating this case.

<<9666.17;9669.65;en>>
The evidence is all one way.

<<9669.65;9696.01;en>>
This case calls upon the court to demonstrate that it is capable of dealing fully and faithfully, not just with cases involving the fine-tuning of domestic administrative law in Western Europe, but also with cases involving gross human rights violations committed on a mass scale in the eastern reaches of the continent.

<<9696.01;9699.69;en>>
That is this court's mandate, and it's its clear duty.

<<9699.69;9705.93;en>>
And it is the standard against which the credibility of the court's judgment will be evaluated.

<<9705.93;9710.33;en>>
The standard of proof has more than adequately been met.

<<9710.33;9724.89;en>>
There is plainly a coexistence of sufficiently clear facts and sufficiently strong inferences, establishing both the existence of an administrative practice and the commission of widespread violations.

<<9724.89;9731.29;en>>
Mr President, Georgia is confident that the court will reflect this in its judgment.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<9733.29;9736.57;en>>
Thank you very much Mr. Emmerson.

<<9736.57;9740.53;en>>
Now I give you the floor to the Russian government and Senator Mr. Swainston.

<<9740.53;9740.53;en>>
Please, you have the floor.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<9743.34;9746.58;en>>
Mr. President, members of the court,

<<9746.58;9758.94;en>>
unfortunately, you've just had an example of what we have been faced with, assertion and allegation, but often without evidence.

<<9758.94;9767.94;en>>
And unfortunately, it's necessary to look very carefully at the evidence to which Milone and Friend refers.

<<9767.94;9773.22;en>>
He made much of Mr. Putin's reference to a plan,

<<9773.22;9775.46;en>>
but please look at that interview.

<<9775.46;9779.5;en>>
It's entirely clear that the plan was defensive.

<<9782.22;9791.22;en>>
The South Ossetians had to hold the position until Russia was able to intervene.

<<9791.22;9805.42;en>>
There is nothing in the plan about any intention to occupy or any intention to drive out Georgians or anything of the sort.

<<9808.1;9815.54;en>>
Milone and Friend also relies upon support, economic support, to Russian pensioners and so on and nationals there.

<<9815.54;9817.74;en>>
That's hardly surprising.

<<9817.74;9822.98;en>>
These people are in part of the former Soviet Union.

<<9822.98;9827.1;en>>
There is a North Ossetia, which is within Russia.

<<9827.1;9828.62;en>>
It's not surprising.

<<9832.26;9844.5;en>>
It is striking that at no time in any of his submissions has Milone and Friend identified any advantage to Russia from this so-called invasion.

<<9848.14;9853.62;en>>
He talks about support, and indeed, there is an economic burden.

<<9853.62;9870.34;en>>
It's not an advantage to Russia, and Russia, you saw, withdrew its forces very quickly after the military objective of neutralizing the Georgian threat was eliminated.

<<9870.34;9877.54;en>>
Now, Milone and Friend doesn't want to talk about the attack on Skinval.

<<9877.54;9884.14;en>>
And he says it's irrelevant, but it's very relevant.

<<9884.14;9903.58;en>>
We must all examine our hearts and consider how we would feel if our families were bombarded as they slept at night, if civilians were attacked on such an appalling scale with totally indiscriminate weapons.

<<9903.58;9908.18;en>>
And there is no doubt about that.

<<9908.18;9915.42;en>>
The NGOs are certainly not misleading when they talk about the extent of that attack.

<<9915.42;9925.06;en>>
Human Rights Report up in flames, pages 41 to 52, pages 53 to 56, pages 57 to 63.

<<9925.06;9931.02;en>>
Amnesty International, civilians in the line of fire, pages 24 to 28.

<<9931.02;9941.14;en>>
The report of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, pages 34 to 41.

<<9941.14;9961.66;en>>
Of course it's relevant, because what Georgia did in that treacherous way on the 7th to 8th of August during the night ignited the ethnic tension that led to lawlessness and criminality and revenge attacks.

<<9961.66;10003.3;en>>
It created precisely the situation that could not be controlled, not by the Assetian government, where Georgia had done its best to wipe out all mechanisms of civil society, and certainly not by the Russians, who were resisting a Georgian attack and positioned until they withdrew to resist a counterattack, which was always in the offing, because it was clear that Georgia was relying on its allies to bring back troops, to provide further support, to rearm, et cetera.

<<10003.3;10029.62;en>>
So there hasn't been benefit to Russia from this, except the humanitarian one of protecting peacekeepers, protecting its nationals, and by supporting the policing of borders, protecting the people of South Ossetia from what would happen to them if that support were withdrawn.

<<10029.62;10036.58;en>>
Now, another example of where one has to look carefully when Milerno-Friend refers to evidence.

<<10036.58;10045.74;en>>
He said that there was a report proving that Gori was hit with an Iskander missile that belonged to Russia.

<<10045.74;10048.66;en>>
Well, that puzzled me somewhat.

<<10048.66;10053.46;en>>
I could think of the Dutch report, but I thought, with respect, I'd dealt with that.

<<10053.46;10066.94;en>>
Turns out that he's referring to a document that makes clear there are two versions of the Iskander missile, the Iskander-M, which is used by Russian forces, and the Iskander-E, which is the export version with a more limited range.

<<10066.94;10069.5;en>>
That's all that it says.

<<10069.5;10073.62;en>>
It doesn't say that there was an attack on Gori.

<<10073.62;10080.26;en>>
It doesn't provide any answer to Isaac Newton and physics.

<<10080.26;10083.3;en>>
And the physics is not my evidence.

<<10083.3;10085.66;en>>
I'm not sure Milerno-Friend was in the room.

<<10085.66;10087.34;en>>
If he was, perhaps he drowsed.

<<10087.34;10088.78;en>>
Homer nodded.

<<10088.78;10095.5;en>>
Because it's entirely clear that there was expert evidence.

<<10095.5;10105.88;en>>
There was a man who knew more about the Iskander missile than most, and he gave details of the weight of the pieces.

<<10105.88;10109.46;en>>
I've said hundreds of kilograms, but you see the precise figures in his evidence.

<<10109.46;10116.54;en>>
And he also explained that they came down at hundreds of meters per second.

<<10116.54;10124.7;en>>
The references are page eight of the confidential exhibit that we prepared, but please be careful because the page reference is there to the uncorrected transcript.

<<10124.7;10127.86;en>>
So they can be out by one or two pages.

<<10127.86;10130.9;en>>
But the points are clear.

<<10130.9;10137.22;en>>
At page 80 of 423, he gave evidence of the speed.

<<10137.22;10144.86;en>>
And what's striking is that the Dutch experts didn't consider that at all.

<<10144.86;10154.94;en>>
It transpired at the hearing that they didn't think that it was their job to consider why a particular missile's piece came to rest on a sofa in a particular top floor flat.

<<10154.94;10161.2;en>>
And no, it wasn't necessary for them to consider the quality of the tarmac.

<<10161.2;10167.22;en>>
There was expert evidence, and my learned friend has got no answer to it.

<<10167.22;10175.3;en>>
My learned friend then said that we had no evidence, and we made up this story of cluster attacks.

<<10175.3;10182.4;en>>
Well, you've seen Human Rights Report in the open exhibit.

<<10182.4;10190.02;en>>
At page 30, they explain that they were misled based upon the accounts of nearly a dozen witnesses interviewed separately.

<<10190.02;10191.62;en>>
He says no evidence.

<<10191.62;10202.54;en>>
Well, at page 31, they refer to the sources through which researchers gathered evidence of M85s in or near a band of nine villages.

<<10202.54;10212.94;en>>
M85s are the Georgian cluster munitions, and I made reference earlier to them being found next to the bodies of people in Shindizi.

<<10216.26;10221.62;en>>
My learned friend chooses not to answer evidence.

<<10221.62;10227.02;en>>
He either mischaracterizes it, or he pretends that it's not there.

<<10227.02;10236.38;en>>
I note that he's given no answer to what caused the hole in Mr. Storeyman's skull, presented

<<10236.38;10245.78;en>>
in a picture from Georgia just three weeks ago, or why the particles left inside the head are clearly not Iskander bullets.

<<10245.78;10250.3;en>>
That was nothing to do with an Iskander, and my learned friend has no answer.

<<10253.38;10269.58;en>>
Now, it is important in this case that the court considers its role very carefully.

<<10269.58;10278.94;en>>
I am respectfully grateful to the court for the evidential hearing that we had.

<<10278.94;10295.06;en>>
But the court needs to consider whether it is feasible for it to determine these questions of international humanitarian law on a massive scale of conflict in the context that we have seen.

<<10298.22;10306.06;en>>
Because with respect, it is difficult to have a satisfactory evidential hearing in this context.

<<10306.06;10308.98;en>>
Not all witnesses are there.

<<10308.98;10312.14;en>>
Not all parties are there.

<<10312.14;10333.62;en>>
My learned friend suggested that while Russia stands behind the government of Ossetia, and it's got effective control over all of South Ossetia as a result, well, if one were applying that logic, I suppose the United States would be regarded as having effective control over many places, including Georgia, at the relevant time.

<<10333.62;10336.82;en>>
But we don't have evidence from any of those people.

<<10336.82;10341.82;en>>
We wanted, but didn't have, evidence from Human Rights Watch.

<<10341.82;10345.66;en>>
We wanted to ask questions of Mr. Garlasco.

<<10345.66;10358.38;en>>
We wanted to see what the extent of his influence was in some of the adverse findings within the Human Rights Watch report against Russians.

<<10358.38;10382.22;en>>
We wanted to check whether the people put up as witnesses at the evidential hearing were the same as the dozen witnesses who misled Human Rights Watch, as to which there is their admission and as to which there's the solid evidence of M85 cluster munitions made in Israel and bought by Georgia, which killed people.

<<10382.22;10391.5;en>>
People, whom a learned friend says, must have been killed by Russians in bombing raids.

<<10391.5;10396.46;en>>
Now, that is an enormous evidential burden, if the court is going to get into that.

<<10396.46;10406.22;en>>
And with respect, I'd suggest that we have shown enough to show that you can't trust just pictures and video in this context.

<<10406.22;10409.46;en>>
There's more in the written submissions.

<<10409.46;10415.26;en>>
Mr. Hoff took other pictures, and we found some,

<<10415.26;10422.5;en>>
before he took a picture of the street scene, where there's devastation from an alleged bombing raid.

<<10422.5;10424.42;en>>
And the main picture is very evocative.

<<10424.42;10431.74;en>>
There's a teddy bear there, designed to suggest that a child has probably died in this bombing raid.

<<10431.74;10435.74;en>>
But if you look at the picture taken earlier, the teddy bear isn't there.

<<10435.74;10443.58;en>>
That seems to be some kind of artistic addition, as part of an information operation.

<<10443.58;10450.9;en>>
Now, when the court is confronted with that, how is it feasible to get to the bottom of it?

<<10450.9;10458.3;en>>
We have shown some things, and we've been fortunate to do so with 15 minutes of cross-examination per witness.

<<10458.3;10461.18;en>>
But some of these questions are complex.

<<10461.18;10468.46;en>>
And it's difficult to imagine how one can deal with them in 15 minutes.

<<10468.46;10471.3;en>>
Eredvi, as a situation, was complex.

<<10471.3;10476.78;en>>
One's got conflict between different satellite evidence.

<<10476.78;10491.94;en>>
One's got, in fact, within that, corroboration of the witness evidence given by Russia, that Eredvi was also bombarded by Georgian forces, as Russian forces advanced on the night of 10th to the 11th.

<<10491.94;10505.1;en>>
And that's why you get all of the artillery craters and the smashing of houses that you see on the later UNICEF picture of the 19th.

<<10505.1;10507.74;en>>
But this is the kind of detail that you've got to get into.

<<10507.74;10511.22;en>>
And to do it in 15 minutes is impossible, to do it properly.

<<10511.22;10515.74;en>>
We've done enough to show that there are massive holes.

<<10515.74;10527.62;en>>
But one can imagine how those inclined to mislead the court, or to use it for propaganda purposes, could do a better job, perhaps, next time.

<<10527.62;10532.54;en>>
And that may have consequences.

<<10532.54;10544.62;en>>
It may mean that there's an incentive on states to penetrate NGOs and affect the reports that they produce and the work that they do.

<<10544.62;10553.14;en>>
And that detracts from the essential work of NGOs, which must be absolutely neutral.

<<10553.14;10557.46;en>>
And there are other consequences, too.

<<10557.46;10563.42;en>>
I talked about universality before in relation to international humanitarian law.

<<10563.42;10570.98;en>>
It's vital that the same rules apply across the planet and that they are clearly understood by commanders.

<<10570.98;10574.1;en>>
And if they are not, then civilians will suffer.

<<10574.1;10577.62;en>>
And even soldiers can suffer unnecessarily.

<<10577.62;10608.98;en>>
I recall from the UK an example where, at an inquest, the widow of a British soldier complained that it seemed to be British Army policy in Afghanistan that snipers could not shoot people they saw laying roadside bombs because of proportionality in terms of response to the threat.

<<10608.98;10611.9;en>>
They were not posing an immediate threat.

<<10611.9;10618.14;en>>
Shooting at them might put civilians in danger, this kind of point.

<<10618.14;10631.14;en>>
Of course, if the bomb layer is not shot when he's seen, he's going to go around the corner and lay another bomb and more soldiers or civilians die.

<<10631.14;10645.1;en>>
Now, in a situation like that, when a sniper is asking his commander what he should do, can I shoot this man, the answer from his commander should not be, oh, just wait a little while.

<<10645.1;10649.54;en>>
I've got to do some context-dependent interplay.

<<10649.54;10651.5;en>>
What does that mean?

<<10651.5;10658.1;en>>
He's got to look at the different rules for reconciliation of humanitarian law and convention law.

<<10658.1;10661.34;en>>
And perhaps he's got to read a few cases of this court.

<<10661.34;10664.94;en>>
It's no answer to say that the rules will eventually be settled by case law.

<<10664.94;10668.66;en>>
Lots of people will have died by then.

<<10668.66;10680.72;en>>
And even if this court comes up with its version of how to amalgamate and reconcile the rules, it may be different in another human rights tribunal.

<<10680.72;10687.66;en>>
And the universality of IHL, the laws of war, will be lost.

<<10687.66;10689.04;en>>
And I do urge upon you this.

<<10689.04;10708.5;en>>
Please go back to our merits submissions and our analysis of the Geneva Conventions and the way that we note that there was specific attention to whether there ought to be a court to adjudicate on matters of IHL in the way that this court adjudicates on the Convention.

<<10708.5;10714.34;en>>
And that was rejected because of concern for universality.

<<10714.34;10721.62;en>>
The clarity and universality of international humanitarian law rules must be paramount.

<<10721.62;10729.94;en>>
And there will be a great humanitarian cost if that clarity and universality is lost.

<<10729.94;10734.46;en>>
I do need to deal very shortly with one other point.

<<10734.46;10747.6;en>>
My learned friend, again without condescending to any particulars, suggested that there was no point in looking at domestic remedies in Russia.

<<10747.6;10754.74;en>>
Please look at our open exhibit at the back.

<<10754.74;10771.58;en>>
You will see that at pages 1 to 4 onward, there have been perfectly sensible questions asked by the Russian investigative committee of their Georgian counterparts.

<<10771.58;10780.9;en>>
They ask, well, the first point is made that no complaints were received in 2008.

<<10780.9;10787.06;en>>
But then an investigation into allegations involving Georgians was launched.

<<10787.06;10791.74;en>>
And requests were made for evidence in support.

<<10791.74;10798.54;en>>
And if you go beyond the exhibit to the actual correspondence, you see perfectly sensible questions.

<<10798.54;10800.34;en>>
Who was the victim?

<<10800.34;10802.94;en>>
Who was there and witnessed what?

<<10802.94;10804.66;en>>
What property was affected?

<<10804.66;10807.94;en>>
Is there evidence that the victim owned the property and so on?

<<10807.94;10813.42;en>>
Please provide evidence from any investigations that you have undertaken.

<<10813.42;10820.3;en>>
Now, the victims are in Georgia or in the buffer zone.

<<10820.3;10825.34;en>>
How can Russia investigate without such assistance?

<<10825.34;10830.58;en>>
It can't. Should such assistance be given?

<<10830.58;10832.26;en>>
Obviously, yes.

<<10832.26;10839.9;en>>
And I repeat that that was the view of the International Fact-Finding Mission, as quoted by Mr. Galperin.

<<10839.9;10844.14;en>>
Georgia has ignored that injunction.

<<10844.14;10847.18;en>>
And one has to ask why.

<<10847.18;10855.62;en>>
I respectfully suggest, from what you've seen today, it is because of the fact that Georgia is not willing to be investigated.

<<10855.62;10866.14;en>>
And if you ask why that should be today, it's because Georgia does not want proper evidential inquiry with more than 15 minutes per witness.

<<10866.14;10869.34;en>>
It doesn't want proper forensic analysis.

<<10869.34;10881.38;en>>
It's trying to survive in this application with propaganda, which it knows that this court cannot properly test with its current resources.

<<10881.38;10888.22;en>>
It demonstrates that this is a political application.

<<10888.22;10895.94;en>>
And as I said earlier, it's designed to take this court outside its proper jurisdictional ambit.

<<10895.94;10898.78;en>>
And that would not assist human rights.

<<10898.78;10901.02;en>>
It would undermine them.

<<10901.02;10901.02;en>>
Those are my submissions.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<10904.16;10907.6;en>>
Thank you very much Mr. Swainston.

<<10907.6;10912.24;en>>
And we have now come to the end of the hearing.

<<10912.24;10915.12;en>>
I thank the parties for their submissions.

<<10915.12;10917.97;en>>
The court will now deliberate on the merits.

<<10917.97;10920.55;en>>
The judgment will be delivered later.

<<10920.55;10923.92;en>>
The parties will be informed of the date of delivery.

<<10923.92;10925.16;en>>
I declare the hearing closed.

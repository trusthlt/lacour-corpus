La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<138.5;140.58;en>>
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.

<<140.58;147.94;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of Murray against the Netherlands.

<<147.94;157.14;en>>
The application was lodged with the court under Article 34 of the Convention on the 22nd of February, 2010, by a Dutch national, Mr. James

<<157.14;158.94;en>>
Clifton Murray.

<<158.94;165.66;en>>
It was allocated to the third section of the court, pursuant to Rule 52, Paragraph 1 of the Rules of Court.

<<165.66;186.02;en>>
On the 10th of December, 2013, a chamber of that section declared the application partly admissible and delivered a judgment in which it held that neither the life sentence imposed on the applicant nor the conditions of his detention were in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.

<<186.02;201.9;en>>
On the 5th of March, 2014, the applicant requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention, and the panel of the Grand Chamber accepted that request on the 14th of April, 2014.

<<201.9;207.66;en>>
Meanwhile, on the 26th of November, 2014, the applicant passed away.

<<207.66;218.54;en>>
By a letter of the 6th of December, 2014, his representative informed the court that the applicant's son, Mr. Johnny Francis van Heyningen,

<<218.54;229.42;en>>
as well as the applicant's sister, Miss Altagracia Murray, intended to pursue the application before the court on behalf of the applicant.

<<229.42;234.26;en>>
The government are represented by their agent, Mr. Roeland

<<234.26;240.54;en>>
Böcker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, assisted by Dr. Martin Kuijer of the Ministry of Security

<<240.54;244.34;en>>
and Justice, and by Mr. Anton van der Schans,

<<244.34;249.54;en>>
Advocate General of the Curaçao Public Prosecutor's Office Advisors.

<<249.54;253.58;en>>
The applicant is represented by Mrs. Claudia

<<253.58;258.94;en>>
Reijntjes-Wendenburg, counsel assisted by Professor Jan Maarten Reijntjes Advisor.

<<258.94;265.0;en>>
I welcome the representatives of the parties in the name of the court.

<<265.0;278.02;en>>
I would also like to welcome a delegation of Dutch judges and prosecutors, as well as a delegation of Turkish judges and prosecutors who are visiting the court.

<<278.02;291.94;en>>
I would explain that, in addition to interpretation in the two official languages of the court, English and French, interpretation into Turkish has been authorized for the benefit of the delegation of Turkish judges and prosecutors attending this hearing.

<<291.94;301.8;en>>
This interpretation is not arranged by the court, and no transcription of the oral translation will be included in the official record of the proceedings.

<<301.8;312.46;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and the representative of the applicant, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<312.46;315.26;en>>
Mrs. Reijntjes-Wendenburg, for the applicant,

<<315.26;320.26;en>>
will speak first, and then Mr. Böcker for the government.

<<320.26;320.26;en>>
I call Mrs. Reijntjes-Wendenburg.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<325.2;327.2;en>>
Thank you.

<<327.2;330.84;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<330.84;332.76;en>>
good morning.

<<332.76;338.34;en>>
As you already know, the applicant, James Murray, died a few weeks ago.

<<338.34;342.58;en>>
His sister and her son wish to pursue the proceedings.

<<342.58;354.16;en>>
Before I continue with additional observations on the merits of the case, I will set forth why the case should proceed and not be struck down.

<<354.16;360.16;en>>
Why is it so important that a judgment will be given on the merits in the present case?

<<360.16;362.5;en>>
The answer is twofold.

<<362.5;366.5;en>>
Both Mr. Murray's son and sister have a legitimate interest

<<366.5;371.4;en>>
to receive a judgment from your court with regard to Mr. Murray's complaints,

<<371.4;379.24;en>>
in particular on the question whether the government would have had the obligation to assure Mr. Murray a treatment

<<379.24;394.4;en>>
that would be adapted to his condition and suitable to help him in regaining his liberty by eliminating his dangers to others, or in other words, to create de facto a prospect to be released.

<<394.4;403.68;en>>
Answering that question is also of very great importance in the general interest when it comes to respect of human rights.

<<403.68;408.34;en>>
First, I will set forth the legitimate interest of Mr. Murray's relatives.

<<408.34;413.72;en>>
Subsequently, I will pursue that question of general interest.

<<413.72;416.42;en>>
Mr. Murray's son was born three years

<<416.42;419.42;en>>
before his father was convicted for murder.

<<419.42;426.3;en>>
He has been missing a father not only during his youth, but for more than 30 years.

<<426.3;430.76;en>>
In 1999, Mr. Murray's son moved to the Netherlands

<<430.76;434.96;en>>
for a better job and better educational opportunities.

<<434.96;444.78;en>>
A nonstop flight from Amsterdam to the Dutch Caribbean Islands can take about nine hours and cost on an average 700 euros.

<<444.78;449.02;en>>
Mr. Murray's son told me that he nevertheless visited his son

<<449.02;451.28;en>>
in prison six times.

<<451.28;454.12;en>>
After Mr. Murray had been pardoned,

<<454.12;459.92;en>>
his son almost immediately traveled to Aruba to spend some time with him.

<<459.92;462.5;en>>
During the imprisonment of Mr. Murray,

<<462.5;469.3;en>>
father and son were forced to keep the family ties intact by scare visits and by phone.

<<469.3;473.04;en>>
In view of Mr. Murray's son, the government had both

<<473.04;495.8;en>>
the positive obligation to periodically assess whether his father must still be considered too dangerous to be set free, and if so, to provide him with the opportunity to get adequate treatment to help him to regain his liberty, to reunite with his family, and to restore the family ties.

<<495.8;500.4;en>>
This also counts for Mr. Murray's sister, who lives in Aruba.

<<500.4;513.58;en>>
Although she needed to take care of their sick mother 24-7 for several years, she nevertheless visited him in prison nearly every week.

<<513.58;517.12;en>>
She blamed the government for not providing Mr. Murray

<<517.12;523.12;en>>
with any opportunity to regain his liberty and to reunite with his family.

<<523.12;526.22;en>>
Moreover, Mr. Murray's family was deep ashamed

<<526.22;529.6;en>>
of being him, a whole-life prisoner.

<<529.6;536.54;en>>
After each request for a pardon, the local press again tore him to shreds.

<<536.54;550.28;en>>
I would like to emphasize that it is nevertheless his sister who took care of him after he was pardoned, and he, because of his illness, was not able to take care of himself anymore.

<<550.28;554.86;en>>
She also, from her small pension, paid for his nursing.

<<554.86;562.86;en>>
Since her financial means were insufficient, she even had to lend a considerable amount of money.

<<562.86;565.8;en>>
For Mr. Murray's relatives, it is important

<<565.8;569.94;en>>
that it will be determined whether or not Mr. Murray,

<<569.94;575.24;en>>
on justified grounds, remained in prison for 35 years.

<<575.24;587.96;en>>
One must remember that a person retains his or her convention rights during imprisonment so that any restrictions on those rights must be justified in each individual case.

<<587.96;591.56;en>>
The question of justification affects Mr. Murray's son

<<591.56;596.2;en>>
and sister's fundamental right to family life.

<<596.2;603.84;en>>
There is also a general interest, since, in our view, the case of Mr. Murray raises both a serious issue

<<603.84;610.34;en>>
of general importance and a serious question affecting the interpretation of the convention.

<<610.34;626.26;en>>
As we already stated in our request of 5 March 2014 for referral of the case to the Grand Chamber, the points of law mentioned therein are important and of such a general nature that they deserve to be clarified.

<<626.26;652.68;en>>
In the case of Winter, your court decided that where domestic law does not provide for the possibility of a periodic review, a whole life sentence will not measure to the standards of Article 3 of the convention and that a whole life prisoner is entitled to know at the outset of his sentence what he must do to be considered for release and under which conditions.

<<652.68;657.28;en>>
This decision has been elucidated in the Magyar case.

<<657.28;678.14;en>>
When the review takes the form of an executive decision, the law has to provide for specific guidance as to what kind of criteria or conditions are to be taken into account in the gathering and organization of personal particulars of the prisoner and in the assessment of his request.

<<678.14;684.78;en>>
The case of James Murray illustrates that it does not solve all problems.

<<684.78;691.12;en>>
How exactly should a prisoner know what he must do to be released?

<<691.12;709.64;en>>
Would criteria given by law be sufficient or does the government have a positive obligation to draw up a specific plan for his personal rehabilitation and if so, if necessary, to help him in rehabilitating himself?

<<709.64;717.98;en>>
We think it is important that Europe will be given more guidance on these and maybe other aspects.

<<717.98;724.78;en>>
Obviously, this was also the position of the panel that referred the case to this chamber.

<<724.78;741.54;en>>
It raises a serious question affecting the interpretation and application of the Convention and its protocols and a serious issue of general importance, the criteria provided by Article 43, Paragraph 2 of the Convention.

<<741.54;758.86;en>>
Article 37, Paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that the court shall continue the examination of the application if respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the protocols he so requires.

<<758.86;763.5;en>>
Such a situation appears here.

<<763.5;772.64;en>>
According to a recent study of your court, in nine of the Council of Europe's member states, life imprisonment did not exist.

<<772.64;787.88;en>>
In the majority of the member states where life imprisonment did exist, there also existed a dedicated mechanism for reviewing the sentence after the prisoner had served a certain minimum period fixed by law.

<<787.88;804.86;en>>
And five of the Council of Europe's member states, one of them being the Kingdom of the Netherlands, only allowed whole life prisoners to apply for communication of life sentence by mean of ministerial, presidential, and royal pardon.

<<804.86;827.26;en>>
We are aware of your court's case law that the choice of a specific criminal justice system, including sentence review and release arrangement, is in principle outside the scope of your court's supervision, provided that the system does not contravene the principles set forth in the Convention.

<<827.26;836.06;en>>
Each system, however, must meet certain minimum requirements to guarantee the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention.

<<836.06;850.42;en>>
Until 2011, nowhere in the Kingdom of the Netherlands existed a dedicated mechanism for reviewing the sentence after a whole life prisoner had served a certain minimum period.

<<850.42;870.06;en>>
In the autonomous region of Curaçao, where James Murray was sentenced, until 2011 a pardon could only be obtained by the governor, but no criteria were provided and for refusal of a pardon, no reasons had to be given.

<<870.06;886.02;en>>
Since 2011, the court may, after 20 years of the sentence having been served, order a professional release if the further execution of the sentence does not serve a legitimate interest anymore.

<<886.02;901.92;en>>
More specific criteria, however, are not provided and there is no way in which a whole life prisoner can know what he should do to be considered for release and under which conditions.

<<901.92;914.78;en>>
Moreover, the system does not provide in any programs, interventions or treatments of whole life prisoners during their detention with the view of achieving release.

<<914.78;925.32;en>>
During their detention, neither information on specific needs is gathered, nor a psychological or a psychiatric examination takes place.

<<925.32;939.6;en>>
No plans for rehabilitation are made and the penal policy under which whole life sentences are pursued is not even intended to facilitate the reintegration into free society.

<<939.6;955.92;en>>
In brief, whole life prisoners do not have any concrete and realistically attainable chance ever to be released, provided one does not become incurably ill like James Murray.

<<955.92;978.9;en>>
More in general, the question raises whether it will be sufficient only to provide a whole life prisoner with information, especially when he is in need of psychiatric treatment without being aware what exactly is wrong with him or maybe without being aware that he is needing such treatment at all.

<<978.9;989.74;en>>
We think that all governments have a positive obligation to try to rehabilitate prisoners who for a long time are being deprived of their liberty.

<<989.74;1013.2;en>>
And our position is that not providing whole life prisoners with a more than theoretical possibility of rehabilitation deprives them of any effective prospect of release and makes whole life sentence grossly disproportionate and as such incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention.

<<1013.2;1019.58;en>>
In conclusion, in the present case, the individual right to family life of Mr. Murray's son

<<1019.58;1034.62;en>>
and sister is involved, as well as the general interest, since the case both raises an issue of general importance and a serious question affecting the interpretation of the Convention that needs to be clarified.

<<1034.62;1043.54;en>>
For these reasons, the circumstances in the present case are different from that in the case of Ligier against France.

<<1043.54;1056.54;en>>
Therefore, we request you not to strike the case off the list, but to continue the examination of the application since respect for human rights requires so.

<<1056.54;1063.58;en>>
Now I will continue with additional observations on the merits of the memorial.

<<1063.58;1066.16;en>>
What is it all about?

<<1066.16;1076.54;en>>
By now, it will be clear that even a whole life prisoner should have a more than theoretical prospect of release.

<<1076.54;1088.54;en>>
For that reason, domestic law should provide for the possibility of periodic review whether further execution of the sentence is still serving a legitimate interest.

<<1088.54;1099.22;en>>
Any whole life prisoner is entitled to know at the outset of his sentence what he must do to be considered for release and under which conditions.

<<1099.22;1116.0;en>>
Obviously, the absence of a system of periodic review and or not providing the required knowledge constitutes an infringement of Article 3 of the Convention, which may be invoked in court immediately.

<<1116.0;1131.22;en>>
In the case of James Murray, the Third Chamber quite rightly affirmed that in the autonomous region of Curaçao, where he was sentenced until 2011, no system of periodic review existed.

<<1131.22;1139.36;en>>
Before, a release could only be obtained by way of a pardon based on a provision in the Constitution.

<<1139.36;1149.44;en>>
Criteria on when a pardon would be granted, if those existed at all, were and are still not known to the public.

<<1149.44;1156.54;en>>
Even the procedure to be followed is not regulated by law, but only by custom.

<<1156.54;1170.0;en>>
It seems that the governor asked for advice of both the public prosecution service and the court, but it is not clear whether or not this is a standard procedure.

<<1170.0;1181.4;en>>
Neither it is clear, and in any case it is not known to the public, whether or not these authorities collect any information before giving their advice.

<<1181.4;1190.04;en>>
And if they do so, what kind of information and what kind of criteria are used when giving their advice?

<<1190.04;1207.0;en>>
There are no regulations providing that these authorities or the governor himself have to assess in the case a prisoner requests a pardon, whether or not his continued imprisonment is justified on legitimate, panological grounds.

<<1207.0;1224.24;en>>
Also, there is no guideline available providing criteria or conditions which must be taken into account in the gathering and organization of personal particulars concerning the prisoner and in the assessment of a request for pardon.

<<1224.24;1239.66;en>>
Moreover, the governor is completely free to ignore the advice of the judicial authorities, and he is not bound to give any reasons when he decides to refuse the request for pardon.

<<1239.66;1262.32;en>>
The government recognized and the third chamber acknowledged, as well as the joint court of justice did after reviewing the sentence of James Murray in 2012, that such a system cannot be regarded as providing the necessary periodic review.

<<1262.32;1273.06;en>>
Subsequently, this has been acknowledged again by the constitutional court of the autonomous region of St. Martin, also a part of the kingdom of the Netherlands,

<<1273.06;1281.2;en>>
where the same rules still exist as having been applicable on Curaçao until 2011.

<<1281.2;1298.42;en>>
Moreover, the government itself has recognized that this possibility of obtaining a pardon since 1954 just once resulted in actually pardoning a whole life prisoner, probably also someone who was terminally ill.

<<1298.42;1327.36;en>>
The case of James Murray, who has lodged a number of requests for pardon, not only shows that some of these requests were not even answered, and other requests were refused without giving a proper reasoning, but also that the assessment of these requests was not based on proper considerations, namely whether or not there still were panological grounds to continue the detention.

<<1327.36;1346.4;en>>
For about 30 years, until the joint court's review in 2012, not once a psychological or a psychiatric examination took place to establish the prisoner's actual mental condition with a view to determine whether he remained dangerous.

<<1346.4;1359.22;en>>
Neither the Aruban prison authorities until 2012 have ever been asked how James Murray was behaving during his detention.

<<1359.22;1368.92;en>>
The governor never asked the Aruban prison authorities to report when assessing his requests for pardon.

<<1368.92;1388.44;en>>
The conclusion should have been that the imposition of a sentence of whole life imprisonment on James Murray in itself and the execution of the sentence did not measure up to the standards of Article 3 of the Convention, and that the complaints of James Murray insofar were justified.

<<1388.44;1399.06;en>>
The fact that he did not make much earlier any complaints to your court was only owing to his utter unawareness of his rights.

<<1399.06;1401.1;en>>
But there is more.

<<1401.1;1421.62;en>>
Even if there had been a periodic review provided by law before 2011, and even if the criteria used when deciding on the request for pardon would have been clear, it is highly doubtful whether James Murray really had had a fair chance of being released.

<<1421.62;1424.98;en>>
He did not know what he should do to be released.

<<1424.98;1433.0;en>>
But if he had known, would he have been able to meet these criteria without any professional help?

<<1433.0;1440.56;en>>
The Joint Court of Justice that sentenced him found that he was dangerous owing to his mental condition.

<<1440.56;1454.92;en>>
It is certain that James Murray would remain dangerous without professional treatment, which at that time, according to the Joint Court, was unavailable on Curaçao.

<<1454.92;1461.36;en>>
It, however, remained unclear what kind of treatment was required.

<<1461.36;1478.84;en>>
The expert who examined him before he was sentenced only said that a long institutional treatment would be necessary and that his personality structure should be strengthened to prevent recidivism.

<<1478.84;1485.58;en>>
What could Murray in such a situation have done to improve his mental condition?

<<1485.58;1489.22;en>>
Was he even aware that something was wrong?

<<1489.22;1505.96;en>>
Had it not been up to the government first to assess what kind of professional assistance he actually needed, and then to provide him with this assistance, as so far as reasonably can be expected?

<<1505.96;1529.22;en>>
Does it not follow from your court's case law, in the case of Matthew, that Murray, if necessary, should have been sent to the Netherlands for assessment and treatment, if assessment and effective treatment only were not available on Curaçao?

<<1529.22;1540.8;en>>
In fact, the authorities always took the position that Murray could not be brought to the Netherlands because of his language capabilities being insufficient.

<<1540.8;1547.44;en>>
It is clear that this position was never reassessed after he was sentenced.

<<1547.44;1553.28;en>>
Murray indeed spoke Dutch not fluently, like many inhabitants of Curaçao.

<<1553.28;1558.78;en>>
He, however, understood Dutch, although with some difficulties.

<<1558.78;1561.96;en>>
He could even write simple letters in that language.

<<1561.96;1567.46;en>>
The same counts for many Antillian citizens who were given in the Netherlands.

<<1567.46;1575.2;en>>
So it is highly improbable that Dutch professionals would not be able to cope with this problem.

<<1575.2;1583.44;en>>
As said before, the Joint Court of Justice thought that on Curaçao no adequate treatment would be available.

<<1583.44;1591.28;en>>
This nevertheless leaves the possibility that, after all, treatment has been given on Curaçao.

<<1591.28;1598.22;en>>
The Joint Court, however, concluded in 2012 that it was not.

<<1598.22;1603.52;en>>
It found that James Murray did not receive any treatment at all.

<<1603.52;1613.2;en>>
Moreover, the reports of the CPT makes it rather improbable that efficient treatment had been possible.

<<1613.2;1629.48;en>>
In order to meet a long-existing need for professional behavioral assistance for prisoners, in 1990, a special unit was opened in the Curaçao prison, the Forensic Observation and Counseling Unit.

<<1629.48;1633.82;en>>
The prison has been visited by the CPT in 1992.

<<1633.82;1643.26;en>>
The CPT found that the prison had a total capacity of 198, but at that time was holding nearly 500 inmates.

<<1643.26;1656.98;en>>
The medical staff comprised two general practices, a dental surgeon, a psychiatrist, who only was available for consultation on occasional basis, and a physiotherapist.

<<1656.98;1666.62;en>>
The CPT especially noticed the lack of a psychologist and the inadequacy of outpatient psychiatric care.

<<1666.62;1674.4;en>>
The staff of the FOBA had to cope with these problems by providing differentiated activity programs.

<<1674.4;1682.88;en>>
It is said to have prepared individualized treatment plans to be implemented by the surveillance staff.

<<1682.88;1692.14;en>>
And up-to-date observation records would be maintained for each patient, comprising a weekly psychiatric assessment sheet.

<<1692.14;1716.5;en>>
But can a psychiatrist and a psychologist, who both carry out the main activities of a general psychiatric clinic on Curaçao, and who have neither any penitentiary nor any forensic specialization, be expected to provide sufficient treatment to whole-life prisoners with complex mental problems?

<<1716.5;1724.58;en>>
Did they possess sufficient skills and knowledge even to draw up a plan for the rehabilitation of James Murray?

<<1724.58;1728.88;en>>
Also, this plan has disappeared without a trace.

<<1728.88;1736.72;en>>
The government cannot provide us with any plan or assessment for treatment that would be given to James Murray.

<<1736.72;1744.2;en>>
Obviously, no trace of such a plan or assessment is to be found in the observation records.

<<1744.2;1749.7;en>>
Not one psychiatric assessment sheet had been produced.

<<1749.7;1756.18;en>>
James Murray himself always denied that he received any professional treatment.

<<1756.18;1771.06;en>>
If he did not speak the truth, the government would have been able to provide us in this procedure with plans and assessments and to give an indication on the contents of the given treatment.

<<1771.06;1778.8;en>>
The government did not succeed in providing more than a letter of a Dr. Montoya de Orocoella,

<<1778.8;1792.88;en>>
dated 6 September 1991, in which this doctor mentions the existence of therapeutic contacts with James Murray without clarifying nor specifying their content.

<<1792.88;1798.56;en>>
The government, C.45 of its Memorial on the Merits,

<<1798.56;1807.32;en>>
asked prison authorities on Curacao and on Aruba to produce details on these contacts.

<<1807.32;1822.64;en>>
But the only information these authorities could give was that the medical file of James Murray does not contain anything on such contacts, nor on any treatment given to him.

<<1822.64;1834.92;en>>
We refer to the letters of 24 July 2014 and 1 September 2014 from the psychologists employed by the Aruban prison.

<<1834.92;1847.54;en>>
They only confirm that the Joint Court found in 2012 that James Murray never received any professional treatment to improve his mental conditions.

<<1847.54;1857.12;en>>
At this point, I would like to say something about the general penitentiary climate on Curacao and in the Netherlands.

<<1857.12;1869.02;en>>
After the CPT disqualified in 1994 the situation in the Curacao prison as inhuman and degrading, on Curacao and on Aruba the situation has improved.

<<1869.02;1884.84;en>>
But in 2013 the CPT still had to qualify the general penitentiary culture as being an incapacity culture, hardly providing for any activities from and for inmates.

<<1884.84;1893.02;en>>
The complete lack of treatment in the case of James Murray fits perfectly within this qualification.

<<1893.02;1900.12;en>>
It has not been an accident, but it is a result of governmental policy.

<<1900.12;1912.2;en>>
With regard to whole life prisoners, the penal policy in the Caribbean part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands does not differ from that in the realm in Europe.

<<1912.2;1920.28;en>>
Since 2005, the Dutch government stresses that life imprisonment means imprisonment for life.

<<1920.28;1932.22;en>>
Exemplary is a letter to Parliament from the Dutch Secretary for Justice and Security, Mr. Teven, dated on 16 April 2012, and I quote,

<<1932.22;1935.72;en>>
life imprisonment is imprisonment for life.

<<1935.72;1944.82;en>>
Return into society is excluded unless the exceptional case that a whole life prisoner is granted a pardon.

<<1944.82;1954.84;en>>
For this reason, whole life prisoners do not qualify for activities aiming at reintegration, unquote.

<<1954.84;1972.02;en>>
This is all happening in spite of a clear tendency towards much more emphasis on rehabilitation, which is notably demonstrated by the Council of Europe's legal instrument and your court's case law, whereby the progression principle is developed.

<<1972.02;1992.08;en>>
In the course of serving a sentence, a prisoner should move progressively through the prison system, whereby moving from the early days of a sentence, when the emphasis may be on punishment and retribution, to the later stage when the emphasis should be on preparation for release.

<<1992.08;2012.36;en>>
In the case of Dixon against the United Kingdom, your court underlined the evaluation in European penal policy towards the increasing importance of the rehabilitative aim of imprisonment, particularly towards the end of a long prison sentence.

<<2012.36;2016.7;en>>
Here we come to the essence of this case.

<<2016.7;2031.58;en>>
Even if a prisoner is told what he must do to be eligible for release and under which conditions, he must also be given a real opportunity to satisfy these conditions.

<<2031.58;2055.4;en>>
Our position is that the government should assess of its own accord what will be needed for the rehabilitation of any whole life prisoner to make clear to him what he must do to become eligible for release and, as far as necessary, to provide him with professional assistance to attain this objective.

<<2055.4;2079.46;en>>
In the case of James Murray, after assessment of his mental condition, should have been decided what kind of treatment, therapy, training, support, or activities would have been suitable to improve his mental condition, to strengthen the structure of his personality, and to decrease the risk of recidivism.

<<2079.46;2093.04;en>>
A lack of professional expertise on Curaçao to accomplish this should have resulted in the transfer of James Murray to the Netherlands, where such particular expertise would have been available.

<<2093.04;2103.12;en>>
In conclusion, James Murray was not given any real chance at all to regain his freedom someday.

<<2103.12;2109.96;en>>
What happened was exactly the kingdom's penal policies and intended purpose.

<<2109.96;2112.9;en>>
Or to quote Mr. Taven, and I quote,

<<2112.9;2117.86;en>>
life imprisonment is imprisonment for life, unquote.

<<2117.86;2125.58;en>>
When James Murray had not become terminally ill, he still had been in prison until his death.

<<2125.58;2131.12;en>>
I will end by quoting a line from a CPT report on whole life sentences.

<<2131.12;2136.48;en>>
I quote, nobody should be forced to die in prison, unquote.

<<2136.48;2136.48;en>>
Thank you for your attention.

<<2138.95;2142.63;en>>
Thank you very much Mrs. Reijntjes-Wendenburg. I call Mr. Böcker.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<2148.75;2151.31;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the Grand Chamber,

<<2151.31;2153.21;en>>
good morning.

<<2153.21;2162.67;en>>
Following the death of James Murray on the 26th of November in 2014, the government was informed that Mr. Murray's son,

<<2162.67;2166.75;en>>
Johnny Francis von Hainingen, and Mr. Murray's sister,

<<2166.75;2172.57;en>>
Alta Grazia Murray, wished to pursue the application.

<<2172.57;2182.21;en>>
In its letter of the 10th of December 2014, the Grand Chamber invited the parties to address at today's oral hearing the issue of whether Mr. von Hainingen and

<<2182.21;2186.01;en>>
Ms. Murray have a legitimate interest in pursuing

<<2186.01;2188.17;en>>
the application.

<<2188.17;2198.07;en>>
The timing of this hearing did not allow for a solution of this question beforehand, which is, though inevitable, also unfortunate.

<<2198.07;2208.51;en>>
Openly discussing family relations is a delicate and perhaps painful matter, even more so directly after a person's demise.

<<2208.51;2215.57;en>>
Nevertheless, the issue has to be addressed, since it is decisive for the relevance of anything else.

<<2215.57;2218.87;en>>
So I will do just that.

<<2218.87;2225.11;en>>
Should the Grand Chamber conclude that the alleged relationship with Mr. Murray actually existed?

<<2225.11;2233.53;en>>
And should it find the existence of a close-blood relationship in itself sufficient to allow Mr. von Hainingen and Ms. Murray to

<<2233.53;2235.77;en>>
pursue the application?

<<2235.77;2241.87;en>>
The government has little to add, and will, of course, accept that finding.

<<2241.87;2256.67;en>>
Should, however, the Grand Chamber require the existence of additional personal interests, which the Court's case law would seem to suggest, I draw your attention to the following facts and circumstances.

<<2256.67;2260.63;en>>
In all available reports drawn up about Mr. Murray in the

<<2260.63;2269.01;en>>
course of 35 years, his three children are mentioned sporadically and in very brief terms.

<<2269.01;2275.87;en>>
In his report of October 1979, the psychiatrist Dr. Schoonmaker

<<2275.87;2279.47;en>>
mentions the fact that Mr. Murray had three children with

<<2279.47;2293.57;en>>
three women, but that already during the respective pregnancy periods, and certainly after the children's birth, his attention for both mothers and children sharply decreased.

<<2293.57;2297.73;en>>
According to the report of the psychiatrist Dr. Matros of

<<2297.73;2302.67;en>>
August 2012, Mr. Murray had doubts whether one of the

<<2302.67;2306.37;en>>
children was actually his.

<<2306.37;2314.97;en>>
Insofar as the government was aware on the basis of the files that we have, Mr. van Heineggen never visited Mr. Murray during

<<2314.97;2316.13;en>>
his detention.

<<2316.13;2323.51;en>>
We are now informed that he did, in fact, visit his father six times.

<<2323.51;2328.11;en>>
I cannot give any decisive opinion about that particular issue.

<<2328.11;2332.21;en>>
There is no recollection whatsoever of this in our files.

<<2332.21;2345.57;en>>
What we do have is a recent check by the Aruba Correctional Institute over the past five years where no record was found of any visit by Mr. van Heineggen in that period.

<<2345.57;2349.67;en>>
Finally, I note that Mr. Murray's repeated requests to be

<<2349.67;2356.51;en>>
transferred to Aruba were explicitly motivated by his wish to be closer to his mother.

<<2356.51;2360.83;en>>
There was never any mention of his children.

<<2360.83;2363.47;en>>
The government is aware that this is different from Mr.

<<2363.47;2372.11;en>>
Murray's sister, Altagracia, who did keep in contact with her brother during the second part of his detention in Aruba.

<<2372.11;2391.91;en>>
In this regard, I merely raise the question of whether in a situation where an applicant's closest blood relatives, namely his children, have never had any contact with their father or show no interest in pursuing the application, it falls to another relative to come forward.

<<2391.91;2411.67;en>>
In case the Grand Chamber feels that respect for human rights demands the continuation of the examination, I wish to draw attention to the introduction in 2011, it has been mentioned by the Applicant's Council, of the periodic review of life sentences in the criminal code of Curacao.

<<2411.67;2420.53;en>>
This legislative amendment potentially provides important beneficial consequences for the situation of life prisoners in Curacao.

<<2420.53;2428.31;en>>
I also point at improved institutional facilities for mental health, both in Curacao and Aruba.

<<2428.31;2440.91;en>>
And finally, the introduction of the possibility of confinement to a custodial clinic, also in 2011, in both countries.

<<2440.91;2445.61;en>>
A final note in my introduction, Mr. President,

<<2445.61;2465.11;en>>
should the Grand Chamber decide to pursue the case, I hope that the government will be given a separate chance to express itself on financial issues, which may raise new questions that have not been dealt with so far in the preceding months.

<<2465.11;2467.91;en>>
Mr. President, without prejudice to our point of view on the

<<2467.91;2475.41;en>>
pursuit of the application, I will from now on refer to Mr. van Heineken and Ms. Murray as the applicants and turn to

<<2475.41;2477.57;en>>
the merits of the case.

<<2477.57;2482.37;en>>
Two issues under Article 3 of the Convention are under discussion today.

<<2482.37;2489.51;en>>
Firstly, the question of whether the life sentence imposed on the late Mr. Murray was in conformity with Article 3.

<<2489.51;2499.03;en>>
Secondly, the same question in relation to the applicants' general conditions of detention, both in Aruba and in Curacao.

<<2499.03;2508.61;en>>
A chamber of the Third Section of the Court, in its unanimous judgment of 10 December 2013, declared both allegations unfounded.

<<2508.61;2514.83;en>>
The government considers this judgment a sound basis for its position before the Grand Chamber.

<<2514.83;2520.83;en>>
I will first discuss the question of whether the late Mr. Murray's life sentence was in conformity with Article 3 of

<<2520.83;2522.41;en>>
the Convention.

<<2522.41;2528.37;en>>
In the same context, I will address the question of psychological and psychiatric assistance available to Mr.

<<2528.37;2532.21;en>>
Murray in his respective places of detention.

<<2532.21;2544.41;en>>
I will also, to the best of my ability, answer the additional questions the Grand Chamber raised in its letters of 7 July and 4 December 2014.

<<2544.41;2561.57;en>>
According in particular to the Grand Chamber's judgment in the case of Vinter and others versus the United Kingdom, what is essential for a life sentence to be in conformity with the Convention is the existence of both a possibility of review and a prospect of release.

<<2561.57;2569.41;en>>
I note that this Grand Chamber judgment was duly taken into account by the Chamber in the present case.

<<2569.41;2574.37;en>>
Central to the government's position are the following facts and circumstances.

<<2574.37;2579.53;en>>
Firstly, Mr. Murray was released at the age of 60 after a request

<<2579.53;2594.07;en>>
for pardon based on his deteriorating health was granted on 31 March 2014, 34 years after he was sentenced to life for the murder of 6-year-old Darlie Lai.

<<2594.07;2602.83;en>>
Before that, on 6 September 2013, he was placed in a nursing home on Curacao.

<<2602.83;2606.43;en>>
Mr. Murray's formal status as a prisoner during the intervening

<<2606.43;2613.87;en>>
period primarily meant that the authorities remained financially responsible for his medical care.

<<2613.87;2630.53;en>>
Our first point is, therefore, that as of 6 December 2013, but ultimately as of 31 March 2014, Mr. Murray could no longer claim to be the victim of a violation.

<<2630.53;2645.27;en>>
This chain of events also demonstrates that the pardon system in Curacao, which I will discuss later on, is not the paper tiger the applicants claim and takes a prisoner's personal circumstances seriously into consideration.

<<2645.27;2655.47;en>>
The fact that these circumstances were deplorable in the present case does not in itself diminish the validity of that conclusion.

<<2655.47;2669.23;en>>
Secondly, in anticipation of the introduction in Curacao of an obligatory period of review of life sentences after 20 years, psychiatric examination of Mr. Murray pertaining to such review

<<2669.23;2673.63;en>>
was initiated in September 2011.

<<2673.63;2683.27;en>>
A year later, the Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Curacao, and St. Martin, and of Bonaire, St. Eustatius, and Saba,

<<2683.27;2689.77;en>>
having regard to the reports drawn up, decided that Mr. Murray's sentence still served

<<2689.77;2692.23;en>>
a reasonable purpose.

<<2692.23;2721.23;en>>
The Joint Court specifically took into account the risk of recidivism and the position of the victim's next of kin, while at the same time acknowledging that the interest of society in retribution was no longer valid 33 years after the murder, and this must have been a response to major demonstrations in Curacao against a possible release of Mr. Murray.

<<2721.23;2725.07;en>>
Thirdly, ever since Mr. Murray was convicted,

<<2725.07;2728.73;en>>
he had the possibility of seeking a pardon.

<<2728.73;2741.07;en>>
I note that the Court held in its case law that the form which the required review should take, executive or judicial, is a matter within the margin of appreciation of the State.

<<2741.07;2770.73;en>>
Since the Grand Chamber in its letter of the 4th of December specifically referred to paragraph 57 of the Court's judgment in the case of Laszlo Magyar versus Hungary, I should observe that the Pardons Act, unlike the Hungarian Code of Criminal Procedure, explicitly describes the threshold for a successful pardon request, notably the expiration of the aims pursued through the application of criminal law.

<<2770.73;2782.69;en>>
The authorities will therefore need to examine whether a pardon request demonstrates that that threshold has been reached.

<<2782.69;2790.37;en>>
The nature and intensity of their information gathering will be guided by that same criterion.

<<2790.37;2806.53;en>>
In reply to the Grand Chamber's more specific questions, I reiterate that the power to seek a pardon in Curacao lies with the Governor, who seeks advice from the Joint Court of Justice, which in turn seeks advice from the Public Prosecution Service.

<<2806.53;2813.19;en>>
All of those may seek information from all relevant authorities, institutions, and persons.

<<2813.19;2817.33;en>>
These are obliged to provide such information.

<<2817.33;2822.17;en>>
The Joint Court is obliged by law to motivate its advice.

<<2822.17;2834.29;en>>
The Governor is obliged by law to motivate a decision rejecting the request different from what the Applicants' Council suggested just now.

<<2834.29;2846.23;en>>
While the Governor is the authority taking the decision, the Minister of Justice bears political responsibility, which is expressed by his or her counter signature.

<<2846.23;2852.53;en>>
In reply to the Grand Chamber's question to what extent reports on Mr. Murray were sought and submitted in relation to his

<<2852.53;2868.37;en>>
repeated request for pardon, I submit that all available reports by psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers, for whatever reason they were drawn up, were attached to our memorial of the 1st of September of last year.

<<2868.37;2880.99;en>>
In one of these, a report from the social worker attached to the Aruba Correctional Institute of August 2013 was drawn up specifically in the context of Mr. Murray's pardon request.

<<2880.99;2895.03;en>>
All other reports, a total of 10, were drawn up in different contexts, notably the applicant's conviction, his request to be transferred to Aruba, and the review of his sentence.

<<2895.03;2916.27;en>>
I stress, however, that the need for obtaining information in the framework of a pardon request depends on the circumstances of the case, including on the arguments set forth in the pardon request and on the question of what information is available from other sources.

<<2916.27;2935.27;en>>
Fourthly, in response to the allegation that the pardon system de facto did not provide any relief, I note that since 2009, 99 pardons have been granted in the former Netherlands Antilles and Curaçao.

<<2935.27;2941.33;en>>
Focusing on life prisoners, I can offer the following specifications.

<<2941.33;2951.67;en>>
Since 1980, a life sentence in the Netherlands Antilles has been imposed on nine persons, including Mr. Murray.

<<2951.67;2955.93;en>>
Seven of those, once again including Mr. Murray,

<<2955.93;2959.13;en>>
have sought a pardon.

<<2959.13;2962.43;en>>
One of those seven was extradited to France.

<<2962.43;2972.73;en>>
A second one committed suicide pending his request while the public prosecution service was intending to submit a positive recommendation to the joint court.

<<2972.73;2980.29;en>>
In two instances, a pardon request was granted, including Mr. Murray's.

<<2980.29;2990.79;en>>
Currently, three persons are serving a life sentence in Curaçao on the basis of convictions in the years 1999 and 2000.

<<2990.79;3003.49;en>>
I note that the court held in its decision in the case of Einhorn versus France that the fact that the possibility of a pardon is limited does not justify the conclusion that the sentence is irreducible.

<<3003.49;3019.33;en>>
In its judgment in the case of Yorgov II versus Bulgaria, the court held that the fact that there had been no decision to grant clemency to any prisoner sentenced to life did not suffice to prove that that penalty is irreducible de facto.

<<3019.33;3029.87;en>>
On this last question of the de facto reducibility of a life sentence, the applicants argue, whatever the facts and arguments I have just summed up, that given Mr. Murray's

<<3029.87;3042.53;en>>
individual situation, he had no prospect of release, notably because he was not offered adequate treatment for personality disorder or transferred to a custodial institution in the Netherlands.

<<3042.53;3046.89;en>>
In this regard, I should observe the following.

<<3046.89;3050.03;en>>
Mr. Murray was sentenced to life in Curaçao, or formally

<<3050.03;3054.77;en>>
speaking, in the former Netherlands Antilles.

<<3054.77;3059.57;en>>
The Joint Court of Justice, when convicting Mr. Murray in 1980,

<<3059.57;3071.19;en>>
held that while confinement to a custodial clinic or ter verschikkingstelling would have been appropriate, that option was not available in Curaçao.

<<3071.19;3092.17;en>>
In order to properly understand this situation, let me stress that the Netherlands Antilles had a population of 300,000 at the time, scattered over six islands, Leeward and Windward Islands being some 1,000 kilometers distant from each other and having either Papiamento or English as their respective daily language.

<<3092.17;3099.27;en>>
The country was simply too small to afford its own custodial hospital.

<<3099.27;3116.57;en>>
Furthermore, as the Joint Court observed, transfer to the Netherlands to execute a sentence of confinement to a custodial clinic had in the past proved impracticable and was in the present case considered impossible by the psychiatrist due to Mr. Murray's limited intelligence

<<3116.57;3121.87;en>>
and his insufficient ability to express himself verbally.

<<3121.87;3129.19;en>>
In his letter of the 4th of December, the Grand Chamber inquired about the meaning of these last words.

<<3129.19;3143.63;en>>
Though I should be cautious in pretending to provide an authoritative interpretation of the words of a psychiatrist and of an independent court, especially 35 years afterwards, it is a fact that Mr. Murray's Dutch was very

<<3143.63;3148.43;en>>
poor, as was just confirmed by the applicant's counsel.

<<3148.43;3153.23;en>>
He did speak Papiamento and English in as much as I have been informed.

<<3153.23;3163.43;en>>
Papiamento is a very small language, at the time spoken by some 200,000 persons on the islands of Curacao, Aruba, and Bonaire.

<<3163.43;3170.07;en>>
Communication in that language in daily life in the European part of the kingdom is virtually impossible.

<<3170.07;3175.03;en>>
This is a fortiori the case in the context of psychiatric treatment.

<<3175.03;3183.93;en>>
It is conceivable that this same context would make treatment in English, particularly as it is spoken in the Caribbean, equally difficult.

<<3183.93;3195.51;en>>
What matters, however, is not so much the accessibility of treatment in a custodial institute per se, but rather the effectiveness of such treatment.

<<3195.51;3201.81;en>>
In-depth communication and the creation of a situation of mutual trust are essential.

<<3201.81;3207.57;en>>
And apart from anything else, I note that the joint court did not so much refer to languages.

<<3207.57;3212.63;en>>
It referred to Mr. Murray's inability to express himself

<<3212.63;3218.91;en>>
verbally, so it apparently was conceived as a wider problem than just languages.

<<3218.91;3233.63;en>>
It is therefore understandable that both the psychiatrist and the judges, also taking unfortunate precedence into account, concluded that this language situation, in combination with Mr. Murray's limited intelligence, made a

<<3233.63;3239.33;en>>
successful treatment in the European part of the kingdom illusory.

<<3239.33;3247.17;en>>
I should stress at this point that the administration of justice is the autonomous responsibility of the separate parts of the kingdom.

<<3247.17;3251.97;en>>
Judgments are executed by and within the country in which they are passed.

<<3251.97;3266.61;en>>
The fact that judgments, according to the kingdom statute, may be executed in other countries within the kingdom merely means that judgments are mutually recognized and may be executed without exequatu procedure.

<<3266.61;3273.53;en>>
It does not mean that the place of execution is an open question to be decided on a case-by-case basis.

<<3273.53;3282.77;en>>
It is common policy within the kingdom to request a minimum period of residence directly preceding the judgment in order to allow a transfer.

<<3282.77;3291.41;en>>
The European part of the kingdom, for instance, maintains a residence period of five years as a prerequisite for incoming transfers.

<<3291.41;3294.73;en>>
Mr. Murray's transfer to Aruba should be seen in the light of

<<3294.73;3304.97;en>>
the fact that Curaçao and Aruba were still one country within the kingdom when judgment was passed and during the first six years of Mr. Murray's detention, when he had already lodged his

<<3304.97;3307.81;en>>
first requests for transfer.

<<3307.81;3322.61;en>>
The applicants put a lot of emphasis on the joint court's acknowledgment of the desirability of confinement to a custodial clinic, but ignore the same court's conclusion that transfer to the Netherlands was considered impossible.

<<3322.61;3333.57;en>>
The applicants take for granted, without any substantiation, that confinement to a custodial clinic in a different part of the world would have proven more beneficial to Mr. Murray's

<<3333.57;3338.87;en>>
rehabilitation than placement in a prison in his country of residence.

<<3338.87;3349.01;en>>
This assumption not only conflicts with the joint court's judgment, but more importantly, is also in flagrant contradiction with Mr. Murray's repeated requests to be

<<3349.01;3354.81;en>>
transferred to Aruba, a wish that was ultimately fulfilled in 1999.

<<3354.81;3359.27;en>>
He never requested a transfer to the Netherlands.

<<3359.27;3369.61;en>>
In his letter to the parties of the 7th of July, 2014, the Grand Chamber requested to be informed about the psychological or psychiatric treatment that was offered to Mr. Murray while

<<3369.61;3371.73;en>>
in custody.

<<3371.73;3383.67;en>>
The Grand Chamber thereby drew attention to the finding of the joint court of justice in its decision upon review of September 2012 that no treatment had taken place.

<<3383.67;3396.47;en>>
In answering that question, let me reiterate the joint court's conclusion in its judgment of 1980 that custodial treatment on Curaçao was not possible.

<<3396.47;3406.31;en>>
The joint court's finding of 2012 that no treatment had taken place merely echoes that conclusion, and the government has no grounds to argue differently.

<<3406.31;3410.03;en>>
That said, Mr. President, I note that the applicants do not call

<<3410.03;3419.83;en>>
into question the joint court's 1980 judgment itself or the sentence it imposed, but rather a lack of mental health treatment offered to Mr. Murray.

<<3419.83;3430.91;en>>
Since, however, such treatment was specifically not part of the judgment, the authorities can hardly be blamed for not executing a measure that wasn't imposed by the independent judge.

<<3430.91;3438.31;en>>
The foregoing does not mean that there have been no contacts with mental health workers in the course of Mr. Murray's detention

<<3438.31;3441.07;en>>
and that no help was available to him.

<<3441.07;3448.47;en>>
As I said before, the file contains 11 reports of psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers.

<<3448.47;3460.71;en>>
Among these reports is a letter of the 6th of September 1991 to the Procurator General of Curaçao, drawn up in Spanish and translated in Dutch, of the psychiatrist Dr. Miriam Montoya

<<3460.71;3465.83;en>>
Orejuela concerning Mr. Murray's wish to be transferred to Aruba.

<<3465.83;3469.11;en>>
It was referred to by the applicants' council just now.

<<3469.11;3476.11;en>>
I single out this particular letter since it confirms that Mr. Murray had been placed under psychiatric observation on his

<<3476.11;3487.51;en>>
arrival in what was then called the Corralspecht prison in Curaçao, and that good contact of a therapeutic nature had been established with a view to his rehabilitation.

<<3487.51;3491.39;en>>
Dr. Montoya observes that a transfer to Aruba will further

<<3491.39;3495.59;en>>
contribute to Mr. Murray's rehabilitation, an observation

<<3495.59;3509.59;en>>
that was explicitly shared by the Public Prosecution Service and by the Joint Court, witnessed that court's letter to the Governor of October 1997, which is in the Grand Chamber's possession.

<<3509.59;3522.55;en>>
In other words, towards the end of the 1990s, all those involved were concerned with the objective of rehabilitation and agreed with Mr. Murray that a transfer to Aruba, notwithstanding the

<<3522.55;3530.39;en>>
limited availability of mental health care there, would serve best to reach that aim.

<<3530.39;3540.35;en>>
Already following the Grand Chamber's letter of July, the authorities on Curaçao have attempted on numerous occasions to trace Dr. Montoya in order to seek further amplification of

<<3540.35;3547.07;en>>
her letter, if at all feasible after a quarter of a century, but to no avail, unfortunately.

<<3547.07;3552.77;en>>
In the absence of such amplification, the government relies on the contents of Dr. Montoya's letter, which in

<<3552.77;3557.71;en>>
itself it considers sufficiently clear for present purposes.

<<3557.71;3564.35;en>>
I note in passing, since the Grand Chamber in its letter of the 4th of December inquired about Mr. Murray's stay at the

<<3564.35;3573.71;en>>
Forensic Observation and Counseling Unit in Curaçao, that he was not placed in that unit during the years before his transfer to Aruba.

<<3573.71;3576.63;en>>
Insofar as Mr. Murray's stay in the Aruba Correctional

<<3576.63;3586.23;en>>
Institute is concerned, the government observes, in conformity with the conclusions of both the joint court and the Institute's psychologist, Dr. Maduro, in a

<<3586.23;3593.43;en>>
letter of the 1st of September, which is in the Grand Chamber's possession, that no treatment took place there either.

<<3593.43;3601.01;en>>
I am not informed of any other psychiatric contacts in Aruba until 2011, when the review of Mr. Murray's sentence was

<<3601.01;3602.43;en>>
carried out.

<<3602.43;3606.03;en>>
I repeat, however, that Mr. Murray himself for many years

<<3606.03;3615.51;en>>
requested to be transferred to Aruba, his country of origin, even though he was well aware that availability of psychiatric help was limited there.

<<3615.51;3631.33;en>>
This fact, again, shows that the concept of rehabilitation cannot simply be narrowed down to psychiatric help or treatment alone, and may depend on several factors, including proximity of the family.

<<3631.33;3642.03;en>>
Furthermore, I should stress that a lack of mental health assistance, on which the applicants now put so much emphasis, never appeared to be Mr. Murray's main concern,

<<3642.03;3650.91;en>>
neither in his contacts with the Institute's social workers, nor in the numerous letters he addressed to various authorities.

<<3650.91;3657.59;en>>
In that sense, we cannot find any indication in the files that Mr. Murray was not placed under a regime befitting his

<<3657.59;3659.63;en>>
mental condition.

<<3659.63;3662.35;en>>
Mr. President, the final thing I should say on the issue of

<<3662.35;3664.71;en>>
Mr. Murray's life sentence is this.

<<3664.71;3678.59;en>>
It is true that the Grand Chamber in the Vinter case held that the question of an irreducible sentences compatibility with Article 3 must be analyzed from the perspective of the moment when a prisoner begins serving that sentence.

<<3678.59;3701.31;en>>
While I realize very well that the government is appearing here today to provide answers, not to raise questions, the question inevitably arises whether it is reasonable to hold the state accountable under the convention for a situation which started 35 years ago and became the subject of an application only five years ago.

<<3701.31;3705.23;en>>
In other words, 30 years after it commenced.

<<3705.23;3717.87;en>>
And even more pertinent, is it reasonable to measure the state's behavior since 1980 according to a standard that was introduced by the court for the first time in 2013?

<<3717.87;3724.75;en>>
These questions are all the more relevant since a review of Mr. Murray's situation was initiated only four months

<<3724.75;3728.27;en>>
after the application was received by the government.

<<3728.27;3731.63;en>>
And the law was amended a couple of months later.

<<3731.63;3751.15;en>>
In this regard, the lonely dissenting opinion of Judge Villiger to the Finta judgment sheds an interesting light, where he writes that only an examination at the point in time when the court comes to examine the case would enable the court to do justice to the length of prison time which a detainee has already served.

<<3751.15;3755.59;en>>
There is no doubt that 34 years in prison is a long time.

<<3755.59;3764.35;en>>
It is, however, not as long as the time spent in detention by the applicant in the case of Legere versus France, namely 41 years.

<<3764.35;3768.79;en>>
The court did not find a violation in that case.

<<3768.79;3771.31;en>>
Mr. President, what is left for me to do now, and I will do

<<3771.31;3776.95;en>>
it extremely briefly, is to address the remaining complaints about Mr. Murray's conditions of detention,

<<3776.95;3781.31;en>>
notably the physical circumstances in the Aruba Correctional Institute.

<<3781.31;3792.15;en>>
I note from paragraph 27 of the applicant's memorial of the 10th of August, 2014, that they are not pursuing their complaint in relation to the condition of the prison buildings.

<<3792.15;3802.59;en>>
As a matter of fact, I have very little to add in this respect to our memorial, and indeed to the finding of the chamber in its judgment of December 2013.

<<3802.59;3814.47;en>>
Should, however, the Grand Chamber decide to examine this part of the original application ex officio, I would draw particular attention to the fact that the domestic proceedings lodged by Mr. Murray and 151 other

<<3814.47;3831.11;en>>
inmates of the Aruba Correctional Institute were terminated by a judgment of the Joint Court of Justice of April, 2011, in which the Joint Court meticulously considered the norms developed by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the relevant case law of the court.

<<3831.11;3835.91;en>>
The Joint Court granted several of the complaints while rejecting others.

<<3835.91;3838.67;en>>
Even if Mr. Murray could have claimed individually to have

<<3838.67;3856.43;en>>
been treated in violation of Article III of the Convention as a result of the physical circumstances under which he was detained, an assumption which the government does not support, the Joint Court's 2011 judgment must be considered to have provided sufficient relief for that complaint.

<<3856.43;3859.67;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the Grand Chamber,

<<3859.67;3873.31;en>>
in view of all the arguments I have put forward, the government of the Netherlands is of the view, the government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, rather, is of the view that there has been no violation whatsoever of Article III of the Convention.

<<3873.31;3873.31;en>>
I thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<3875.79;3879.35;en>>
Thank you Mr. Böcker. I turn now to the judge if there are questions.

<<3879.35;3882.55;en>>
Judge Silvis, please.

[[Judge;Johannes Silvis]]

<<3886.51;3888.59;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<3888.59;3894.73;en>>
I have two questions, and one question concerns a clarification.

<<3894.73;3897.69;en>>
But my first question concerns the government.

<<3897.69;3906.31;en>>
My question to the government is about the scope of the possible retroactive effect of the court's judgments.

<<3906.31;3921.33;en>>
After the Vinter judgment, it's clear that life sentences, if proportionate to the facts, can only be in conformity with Article 3 of the Convention if the life sentence is de facto and de jure reducible.

<<3921.33;3932.97;en>>
There is a longstanding position on the part of the court concerning cases in which the applicants have already lodged a complaint with the court at the time of the reversal of case law.

<<3932.97;3940.81;en>>
As they are in exactly the same position as the successful applicant, they should be treated in the same way.

<<3940.81;3950.43;en>>
So one of the differences between the Vinter position and Murray is that at the moment, the court may have to deal with the merits of this case.

<<3950.43;3958.35;en>>
There has been a significant change in the law of Curaçao by the introduction of the review system.

<<3958.35;3970.37;en>>
Now, the government states that the pardon system is already in conformity with the Vinter criteria, if I understand you well.

<<3970.37;3992.23;en>>
But perhaps you may explain why, when introducing the review system, the arguments for introducing this system were to bring the legislation in conformity with current standards of human rights.

<<3992.23;3998.91;en>>
Was it necessary to introduce this new system if the old system already met the criteria?

<<3998.91;4002.35;en>>
Perhaps you would like to elaborate on this.

<<4002.35;4005.23;en>>
Now, my question to the applicants.

<<4005.23;4017.63;en>>
One very small but perhaps important point is the representative of the government stated that there is a pardons act.

<<4017.63;4034.19;en>>
And the representative of the government also stated that that was not in line with the position presented by the applicant, because the applicant referred to the Constitution in which there is a basis for a pardon request.

<<4034.19;4043.75;en>>
Perhaps you could explain whether there is a difference on this legal point between the government and the representative of the applicant.

<<4043.75;4047.63;en>>
The point of clarification is this.

<<4047.63;4065.87;en>>
Listening to your intervention, you refer to an observation of the CPT, the Committee on the Prevention of Torture, observing in 2013 an incapacity culture in the prison institutions in the Antilles.

<<4065.87;4072.55;en>>
However, in 2013, the CPT has not visited the Antilles.

<<4072.55;4093.71;en>>
There is, however, and I think you are referring to this observation report, there is an observation report of two experts assigned by the Dutch government which relates indeed to the CPT observations from 2007 reported in 2008.

<<4093.71;4101.79;en>>
And according to these experts, there are shortcomings, especially in relation to the promotion of sensible activities for the inmates.

<<4101.79;4115.59;en>>
And in this context, they note that the guards are trained to keep control and order, but they are not equipped in the process of re-socialization.

<<4115.59;4128.93;en>>
Is that the observation you have in mind when expressing that there is an incapacity culture in the prisons of the Antilles, more specifically in the Correctional Institute in Aruba?

<<4128.93;4130.83;en>>
Perhaps you may clarify this issue.

<<4130.83;4130.83;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4132.8;4135.44;en>>
Thank you Judge Sylvies, Judge Kjølbro.

[[Judge;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro]]

<<4137.67;4139.15;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4139.15;4147.99;en>>
Both parties have in their pleadings before the Grand Chamber addressed the importance of the principle of rehabilitation as recognized in this court's case law.

<<4147.99;4157.03;en>>
It has been mentioned that the convicted person should know what he must do to rehabilitate himself in order to have the prospect of release.

<<4157.03;4165.01;en>>
It has also been mentioned that the convicted person should be allowed to rehabilitate himself in order to have the prospect of release.

<<4165.01;4172.61;en>>
In other words, it has been argued that the state should not hinder the convicted person from rehabilitating himself.

<<4172.61;4181.11;en>>
This may, in my view, be seen as a negative obligation on the state following from Article III, not to hinder but to allow.

<<4181.11;4188.67;en>>
At the same time, it has been argued today that the state has to provide the convicted person with necessary treatment.

<<4188.67;4202.27;en>>
This may, in my view, be seen as a positive obligation on the state to rehabilitate the convicted person, to rehabilitate or to assume responsibility for the rehabilitation of the convicted person.

<<4202.27;4210.87;en>>
My question to the parties concerned these two aspects of the principle of rehabilitation, the positive and the negative aspect.

<<4210.87;4221.27;en>>
In the view of the parties, taking into account the court's case law, is it necessary to make a distinction between these two aspects of the principle of rehabilitation?

<<4221.27;4231.23;en>>
In other words, are they on an equal footing should the rights of the applicant and the obligation of the state be treated on an equal footing?

<<4231.23;4231.23;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4231.94;4234.98;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque.

[[Judge;Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque]]

<<4238.56;4250.48;en>>
I have two questions for the government, but of course the applicant may also elaborate on these questions.

<<4250.48;4271.4;en>>
The applicant has said that no plan for the rehabilitation of James Murray has ever been prepared by the prison authorities who took care of him.

<<4271.4;4284.84;en>>
The applicant has also said that it is the policy of the Kingdom of Netherlands that all life prisoners do not qualify for activities aiming at rehabilitation.

<<4284.84;4291.18;en>>
And the applicant has even quoted the Dutch Secretary for Justice and Security.

<<4291.18;4293.36;en>>
My two questions are the following.

<<4293.36;4310.4;en>>
First, can you confirm that it is the policy of the Kingdom of Netherlands that all life prisoners do not qualify for activities aiming at reintegration, as Mr. Teeven has said?

<<4310.4;4326.16;en>>
Second, can you confirm that no plan for the rehabilitation of James Murray was ever prepared during the time he spent in prison, over 30 years?

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4329.29;4330.07;en>>
Judge Vučinić

[[Judge;Nebojša Vučinić]]

<<4332.52;4333.64;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4333.64;4337.28;en>>
One very, very short question for government.

<<4337.28;4356.62;en>>
Which were the main reasons, I would say compelling reasons, made the transfer of applicant unfeasible in the realm of Europe to custodial clinic for adequate psychological or psychiatric treatment?

<<4356.62;4356.62;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4358.71;4359.95;en>>
Thank you.

<<4359.95;4362.59;en>>
I have three questions.

<<4362.59;4377.51;en>>
And I would like to refer to the government's memorial concerning the two first questions, and in particular to paragraphs 42 and 45.

<<4377.51;4388.43;en>>
My first question concerns what is stated in paragraph 42 of the government's memorial.

<<4388.43;4406.29;en>>
I read the following, and I quote, with respect to the two prisoners in the ICN serving life sentences, one of whom was the applicant, the CPT has advised the Aruban authorities to draw up a policy for such prisoners.

<<4406.29;4417.79;en>>
And then I read that, I quote, the government would note that in practice, the applicant was able to engage in a relevant daily program.

<<4417.79;4425.31;en>>
He is a talented upholsterer and worked eight hours a day in the ICN's upholstery department.

<<4425.31;4428.19;en>>
My question is the following.

<<4428.19;4436.07;en>>
Was the applicant able to engage in a relevant daily program in the penitentiary in Curaçao?

<<4436.07;4440.11;en>>
And if so, what would such a program have been?

<<4440.11;4447.59;en>>
Could both parties give a concrete description of a day in prison in Curaçao?

<<4447.59;4454.35;en>>
My second question concerns paragraph 45 of the government's memorial.

<<4454.35;4471.11;en>>
I read the following, and I quote again, the government has requested and obtained permission from the applicant's representative to be given information about what kind of psychiatric help was given to the applicant while he was detained in the SDKK.

<<4471.11;4479.15;en>>
However, up until the date of this memorial, the government has not received that information from the ICN medical staff.

<<4479.15;4485.79;en>>
My question would be, do we have more detailed information today?

<<4485.79;4492.27;en>>
The last question is a procedural issue concerning the proceedings before the grand chamber.

<<4492.27;4496.55;en>>
If I understood the government's representative, Mr. Böcker,

<<4496.55;4503.91;en>>
well, this morning he asked to give the government the chance to develop financial issues.

<<4503.91;4505.63;en>>
Now, my question is the following.

<<4505.63;4511.07;en>>
You have elaborated on Article 41 of the convention in your memorial.

<<4511.07;4512.23;en>>
My question is the following.

<<4512.23;4523.47;en>>
Does the government ask the court, in the event, I insist, in the event a violation were to be found, to reserve Article 41?

<<4523.47;4527.35;en>>
Did I interpret your statement correctly?

<<4527.35;4532.63;en>>
Or do you intend to elaborate immediately on this issue?

<<4532.63;4547.67;en>>
And in this event, I would allow, as usual, two more weeks to file an additional comment concerning Article 41, which would be also submitted to the applicant's lawyers for comment, as we do it usually.

<<4547.67;4549.83;en>>
So thank you very much for the time being.

<<4549.83;4554.71;en>>
We will resume the hearing at 10.40.

<<4558.55;4559.99;en>>
Sorry, 10.50.

<<4559.99;4560.51;en>>
10.50.

<<4560.51;4562.39;en>>
So 20 minutes break.

<<4960.71;4961.55;en>>
Please be seated.

<<4961.55;4962.55;en>>
The hearing is resumed.

<<4962.55;4969.55;en>>
I call Professor Reijntjes.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<4972.47;4974.91;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4974.91;4984.55;en>>
First, I will go into the questions of the court, and afterwards I have a few points in reply to the submissions of the government.

<<4984.55;4991.47;en>>
First, the questions of the honorable judge from the Netherlands on pardons.

<<4991.47;4997.95;en>>
There is, on Curaçao, no pardons act later on Aruba.

<<4997.95;5001.27;en>>
There's only one article in the Constitution.

<<5001.27;5009.11;en>>
Before 2010, it only stated that the governor could grant a pardon, nothing more.

<<5009.11;5021.43;en>>
And since 2011, it was added that the governor has to ask the court for its advice on a pardon.

<<5021.43;5026.47;en>>
Further regulation does not exist.

<<5026.47;5052.15;en>>
And on the CPT report, we quoted, we thought from a CPT report, but indeed it could be that we unconsciously quoted from the report of the government experts of 2013 made in preparation of the planned visit of the CPT in, I think, 2014.

<<5052.15;5065.75;en>>
The honorable judge from Denmark asked whether it would be necessary to distinguish between a negative obligation not to hinder and a positive obligation to assist.

<<5065.75;5073.31;en>>
We think accepting a positive obligation to assist implies a negative obligation not to hinder.

<<5073.31;5077.43;en>>
It applies to do instead of hindering.

<<5077.43;5089.91;en>>
Mr. President, you asked us to try to describe a day in prison.

<<5089.91;5093.55;en>>
I think I can be short on this.

<<5093.55;5099.07;en>>
The Curaçao prison is under the population also known as Miracelu.

<<5099.07;5102.11;en>>
That means, look at the sun.

<<5102.11;5119.15;en>>
A day in prison on Curaçao, and I don't think it will be different on Aruba, consists in sitting, waiting till the end of your prison term has come, and in the while, looking at the sun.

<<5122.43;5128.43;en>>
In reply to the submissions of the government, the following, on pardons.

<<5128.43;5144.59;en>>
The government describes that since 1954, nine whole life sentences were given until 2012, I expect, because afterwards there came some more.

<<5144.59;5149.59;en>>
One pardon has been given to a prisoner when dying.

<<5149.59;5151.71;en>>
One committed suicide.

<<5151.71;5154.55;en>>
And that's an interesting case.

<<5154.55;5161.47;en>>
The man who committed suicide has also been 34 years in prison.

<<5161.47;5165.59;en>>
He came from Saba, the island of Saba.

<<5165.59;5167.79;en>>
He made many requests for a pardon.

<<5167.79;5174.39;en>>
They were all refused or not answered at all, like in the case of Mr. Murray.

<<5174.39;5183.51;en>>
He became desperate and committed suicide before he had received an answer to his last request for a pardon.

<<5183.51;5193.27;en>>
Now the government comes and tells us that they intended to grant him a pardon upon his last request.

<<5193.27;5198.83;en>>
I don't think I have to comment any more on this case.

<<5198.83;5201.07;en>>
More important, would Mr. Murray have

<<5201.07;5205.67;en>>
been able to undergo treatment in the Netherlands?

<<5205.67;5208.23;en>>
Honestly, we don't know.

<<5208.23;5215.67;en>>
But we know that no assessment has made after his conviction on his capabilities in this respect.

<<5215.67;5225.47;en>>
He spoke Dutch and English, like many people in the Netherlands and especially in Dutch prisons who receive treatment.

<<5225.47;5227.35;en>>
He was a simple man.

<<5227.35;5243.55;en>>
But at least on Aruba and on Curaçao, he was thought, but especially on Aruba, he was thought capable for many years to instruct younger persons, younger prisoners in upholstery.

<<5243.55;5246.27;en>>
Could he have been transferred according to law?

<<5246.27;5248.39;en>>
The answer is yes.

<<5248.39;5254.91;en>>
There's always been a possibility for special cases like this.

<<5254.91;5266.19;en>>
The regulations after, I think, the newest is from last year, made it explicitly possible for special cases to transfer to the Netherlands.

<<5269.11;5279.67;en>>
And then the government suggested that James Murray himself ended his supposed therapeutic contacts on Curaçao when accepting to be transferred to Aruba.

<<5279.67;5289.51;en>>
The government stated that he requested this transfer despite being aware that the Aruba prison was not equated with a forensic counseling unit.

<<5289.51;5296.51;en>>
It commented that the lack of psychiatric help does not appear to have been a cause for concern to the applicants.

<<5296.51;5306.71;en>>
But how could that be the case, even if he really received any treatment, when he was not aware that he needed further treatment, and if so, what kind of treatment?

<<5306.71;5311.53;en>>
Could he be expected to have any idea with which treatment would be adequate for him?

<<5311.53;5315.87;en>>
Could he be expected to complain about the lack of such treatments?

<<5315.87;5340.91;en>>
Moreover, when a sentence on imposition is an irreducible under domestic law, it will be capricious to expect a prisoner to work towards his own rehabilitation without knowing whether, at an unspecified future date, a mechanism might be introduced which would allow him, on the basis of that rehabilitation, to be considered for release.

<<5340.91;5352.11;en>>
Members of the court, what we discussed today was the sad life of James Murray, sad in the first place because of an incomprehensible crime that he committed in his young days.

<<5352.11;5367.35;en>>
He received a life sentence not because he deserves to be detained for the rest of his life, but because the court thought that at the moment of his trial, he was too dangerous to fix the point of time at which he could regain his freedom.

<<5367.35;5373.91;en>>
Obviously, the court had in mind that he would be pardoned when his dangerousness had ended.

<<5373.91;5381.87;en>>
After more than 30 years of imprisonment, James Murray again appeared in court, this time for assessment of his dangerousness.

<<5381.87;5387.55;en>>
But the court concluded that it still would be too hazardous to liberate him.

<<5387.55;5396.27;en>>
Small wonder, for never, never anything has been done to improve his condition.

<<5396.27;5404.39;en>>
The decision of your courts that all life sentences should be reconsidered after some time has been an important step forward.

<<5404.39;5413.15;en>>
This will only be effective if, from the outset of their sentence, it is made clear to the prisoners what they must do to be considered for release.

<<5413.15;5415.31;en>>
But that is not enough.

<<5415.31;5426.15;en>>
The principle should be established that the authorities have to provide to the prisoners within reasonable limits the help they need to rehabilitate themselves.

<<5426.15;5434.75;en>>
James Murray never understood what he should do to regain his freedom and never received the help he needed.

<<5434.75;5440.99;en>>
We urge your court to take the necessary measures to prevent this happening ever again.

<<5440.99;5440.99;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5442.67;5446.53;en>>
Thank you, Professor Reijntjes.

<<5446.53;5446.53;en>>
Mr. Böcker.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<5447.76;5448.72;en>>
Please.

<<5448.72;5451.64;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<5451.64;5457.28;en>>
I will answer most of the questions of the judges.

<<5457.28;5465.68;en>>
The question by Judge Vucic will be answered by my colleague, Dr. Kier, who may also speak

<<5465.68;5469.8;en>>
for a few words in conclusion.

<<5469.8;5484.92;en>>
First, the question of Judge Silvis, of whether the review was actually necessary if the state is of the view that the preceding situation was already in conformity with the convention.

<<5484.92;5499.32;en>>
My answer to that is, first of all, I have here the new penal code of Curaçao, which is a comprehensive code, of course, fully renewed, reviewed a couple of years ago.

<<5499.32;5508.92;en>>
And the introduction of the review of life sentences was only a small part of this comprehensive review.

<<5508.92;5521.44;en>>
That being said, the government remains of the view that the preceding period was in conformity with the convention, but that doesn't mean that no improvements in that area are possible.

<<5521.44;5523.84;en>>
Standards are, of course, improving.

<<5523.84;5525.28;en>>
Standards are increasing.

<<5525.28;5531.08;en>>
We have seen that in recent years in the court's case law.

<<5531.08;5541.36;en>>
And in order to make the standards even better, this part of the penal code was introduced as well.

<<5541.36;5552.6;en>>
The question by Judge Kilbrough on the difference between rehabilitation as a negative or positive obligation.

<<5552.6;5569.52;en>>
Well, on the negative element, first of all, I merely say that if the court wishes to see this as a negative obligation, the government at least has not done anything to stand in the way of Mr. Marais' rehabilitation.

<<5569.52;5576.68;en>>
That said, we are of the view that rehabilitation entails a positive obligation.

<<5576.68;5585.4;en>>
And in that sense, I repeat what I have said before, that by cooperating to Mr. Marais' transfer to Aruba

<<5585.4;5607.56;en>>
in order to be closer to his family, by at least making available mental health care to a certain extent, and also activities in prisons, the government has fulfilled its positive obligations in this regard.

<<5607.56;5623.76;en>>
The question of Judge Pinto Dalbo-Kerke about whether there has been a plan for rehabilitation, my answer can be short, no, there has not been a plan for rehabilitation.

<<5623.76;5630.4;en>>
There have been activities offered, to which I will come back in answering the question of you, Mr. President, later on,

<<5630.4;5637.2;en>>
but not by means of a rehabilitation plan.

<<5637.2;5661.72;en>>
Then the second question of Judge Pinto, whether rehabilitation is based on a kingdom policy, I must stress here once again that the administration of justice is an autonomous responsibility of the four countries of which the Kingdom of the Netherlands is currently composed.

<<5661.72;5668.04;en>>
The name of Vice Minister Teven has been mentioned here at the initiative of the Applicants' Council.

<<5668.04;5673.6;en>>
This is totally not appropriate in this context.

<<5673.6;5682.48;en>>
This Vice Minister has no responsibility for rehabilitation in Curaçao or in Aruba.

<<5682.48;5691.28;en>>
So I will not even go into that issue any further, nor into his letter of 16 April 2012, which was mentioned.

<<5691.28;5695.32;en>>
That letter is irrelevant in the context of the present case.

<<5695.32;5697.28;en>>
I must stress that.

<<5697.28;5703.68;en>>
Finally, Mr. President, you inquired about the days in prison.

<<5703.68;5711.04;en>>
Now, we have heard in strong words what a day in prison looks like.

<<5711.04;5718.16;en>>
You will forgive me, of course, that I cannot give you a clear picture of exactly how Mr. Moret or anybody else

<<5718.16;5721.8;en>>
spent their days during many years in prison.

<<5721.8;5729.84;en>>
What I can tell you is that in Curaçao, as in Aruba, activities are offered.

<<5729.84;5732.56;en>>
When I speak about activities, I'm talking about work.

<<5732.56;5734.6;en>>
I am talking about work in the kitchen.

<<5734.6;5740.0;en>>
There are, for some prisoners, there is a possibility of working outdoors in a farm.

<<5740.0;5742.88;en>>
There are church services.

<<5742.88;5744.6;en>>
There is a shop.

<<5744.6;5754.6;en>>
There is an outdoor sport facility, even though I realize that the word outdoor may be a little bit ill-conceived here, but you know what I mean.

<<5754.6;5760.12;en>>
There is no roof and there are sport facilities available.

<<5760.12;5766.4;en>>
Whether the prisoner chooses to avail of these activities is, of course, another question.

<<5766.4;5771.96;en>>
Clearly, in Aruba, Mr. Moret did have a regular job

<<5771.96;5777.6;en>>
as an upholsterer, eight hours a day, and he also trained others.

<<5777.6;5785.0;en>>
He did occasionally attend religious services as well.

<<5785.0;5787.6;en>>
And then your other question, Mr. President,

<<5787.6;5793.68;en>>
about paragraph 45 of our memorial, the information from the medical file.

<<5793.68;5800.0;en>>
I think I have addressed that in my pleadings.

<<5800.0;5806.08;en>>
We have done what we could to retrieve any information that was lacking.

<<5806.08;5812.16;en>>
Believe me, I more than you probably would want to have more information here.

<<5812.16;5814.44;en>>
Unfortunately, that is not the case.

<<5814.44;5818.04;en>>
What we have, we have provided to you.

<<5818.04;5821.44;en>>
And then finally, on financial issues, Mr. President,

<<5821.44;5834.72;en>>
it's far from me to complicate the procedure by asking you to refer the issue under Article 41 of the Convention, and I would not even request two weeks.

<<5834.72;5838.04;en>>
I had prepared a few very small words.

<<5838.04;5846.48;en>>
The only reason I didn't express them is because it's always such an anticlimax to talk about money after having spoken about the really serious matters.

<<5846.48;5849.0;en>>
But I can read them out to you.

<<5849.0;5862.6;en>>
The fact that the applicants have not themselves undergone, and when I say applicants, of course, I'm talking about the family members, have not themselves undergone the treatment complained of means that there are no grounds for awarding any just satisfaction to them.

<<5862.6;5871.88;en>>
Furthermore, since the applicants, and again I refer to the family members, by definition may only have incurred costs and expenses after the death of Mr. Murray,

<<5871.88;5890.52;en>>
the government is only prepared to reimburse such costs and expenses, of course, in case the court would conclude that a violation has occurred, insofar as they were made after the 26th of November 2014, and the usual requirements of specification and reasonableness remain applicable, of course.

<<5890.52;5892.92;en>>
So that is what I wanted to say on financial issues.

<<5892.92;5897.44;en>>
If you allow me, I would now pass the floor to my colleague Dr. Kier for a final word.

<<5897.44;5897.44;en>>
Thank you.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<5901.46;5902.06;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<5902.06;5906.18;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the Grand Chamber,

<<5906.18;5915.72;en>>
Judge Vucinic inquired about the impossibilities of a transfer to the European part of the kingdom.

<<5915.72;5917.78;en>>
Now, perhaps two preliminary remarks.

<<5917.78;5921.76;en>>
Of course, first of all, this is at the wish of those concerned.

<<5921.76;5935.92;en>>
If that wish is not expressed, we do not we're not in habit of using the very limited possibilities that we have under the kingdom statutes to transfer prisoners across the ocean.

<<5935.92;5956.02;en>>
And the second one is that there needs to be a clear indication that treatment in the European kingdom would be considered successful, which is not necessarily the case because it also depends on the ability to maintain social contacts.

<<5956.02;5962.02;en>>
Rehabilitation is to a large extent also dependent upon that.

<<5962.02;5967.42;en>>
It has been stressed before, but let me just reiterate it at the outset again.

<<5967.42;5978.92;en>>
The administration of justice is the autonomous responsibility of each constituent party of the kingdom.

<<5978.92;5987.18;en>>
Where a sentence is executed is not a matter of pick and choose where it is most convenient.

<<5987.18;5996.22;en>>
The practice is, the rule is, a sentence is executed within the country concerned.

<<5996.22;6001.72;en>>
That is how our constitutional arrangements of my country work.

<<6001.72;6011.42;en>>
However, it is correct that the possibility exists under Article 40 of the kingdom statute to execute sentences in other countries within the kingdom.

<<6011.42;6017.12;en>>
And here I think it is useful to distinguish two distinct situations.

<<6017.12;6022.58;en>>
Nowadays, and my colleague Mr. Becker referred to it, Article

<<6022.58;6030.34;en>>
180 of the penal code provides the possibility of confinement to a custodial clinic.

<<6030.34;6044.94;en>>
But I can tell you, which is a matter of fact for your information, nobody has been transferred to the European part of the kingdom so far, nor do we have practical arrangements in this context.

<<6044.94;6049.84;en>>
It's different with regard to youth offenders, just for the sake of completeness.

<<6049.84;6069.74;en>>
The Pijmaatregel, and I trust Judge Silvers will be able to translate that in chambers, but youth offenders in need of treatment have been transferred, but this is done specifically on the basis of extensive arrangements between the countries concerned.

<<6069.74;6077.88;en>>
And then the second situation is at the time that we are talking about today, when Mr. Murray was detained.

<<6077.88;6080.76;en>>
Article 180 did not exist.

<<6080.76;6095.84;en>>
Convicted persons would on occasion be transferred, of course, this happens occasionally, but never for reasons of providing custodial treatment or rehabilitation treatment, et cetera.

<<6095.84;6105.74;en>>
Custodial treatment also simply because this is not ordered by the judge concerned, and persons may not be placed in a clinic without a judicial order to that effect.

<<6105.74;6111.68;en>>
And therefore, I think that also is worth emphasizing.

<<6111.68;6115.84;en>>
Mr. President, if you allow me just one minute to conclude.

<<6115.84;6117.86;en>>
Our government's position is the following.

<<6117.86;6131.2;en>>
The government entertains some serious doubts as to the question whether this case should be examined on its merits by the Grand Chamber of the Court, and primarily because we argue that the late Mr. Murray can no longer be

<<6131.2;6143.0;en>>
qualified a victim of an alleged violation of the Convention, having been pardoned, demonstrating that the system works not only de jure, but also de facto.

<<6143.0;6146.02;en>>
And I remind the Court of the applicable figures.

<<6146.02;6151.48;en>>
The past six years, 99 pardons, focusing on live prisoners.

<<6151.48;6154.72;en>>
Seven live prisoners have sought a pardon.

<<6154.72;6157.1;en>>
In two instances, this request was granted.

<<6157.1;6167.04;en>>
And just to be sure, this is not the instance in which the person concerned committed suicide awaiting his pardon request.

<<6167.04;6169.1;en>>
Just want to make that sure.

<<6169.1;6176.48;en>>
In addition, in 2011, the periodic review of life sentences was introduced in the Criminal Code of Curacao.

<<6176.48;6203.24;en>>
Although this periodic review did not exist in 1980, and I also refer to the question by Judge Silvis concerning the retroactive effect of court judgments, the government's position is that it would be entirely unreasonable to measure the state's behavior since 1980 according to a standard that was introduced by the court many, many years later on.

<<6203.24;6206.88;en>>
As for Mr. Murray, I think what is also worthwhile

<<6206.88;6219.16;en>>
considering is that the earlier pardon requests were denied because the domestic authorities held that the continuation of the execution of the sentence still served penological reasons.

<<6219.16;6225.44;en>>
And that view was shared by the joint court in its 2012 judgment, for example.

<<6225.44;6234.12;en>>
And then as for the lack of treatment, whether that is custodial treatment or rehabilitation activities, my conclusion is the following.

<<6234.12;6239.84;en>>
First of all, it's untrue that absolutely no counseling or rehabilitation activities were provided to the applicant.

<<6239.84;6245.76;en>>
The applicant did not always wish to use them.

<<6245.76;6254.0;en>>
He often said to social workers that he had no intention of talking to them.

<<6254.0;6261.64;en>>
I don't think that can be blamed or a government can be made responsible for that.

<<6261.64;6270.44;en>>
As for custodial treatment more specifically, the domestic court imposing the sentence did not order treatment in a custodial clinic.

<<6270.44;6278.08;en>>
You cannot place people in a custodial clinic without there being a judicial basis for that.

<<6278.08;6281.08;en>>
The late Mr. Murray did not express any wish during his

<<6281.08;6282.96;en>>
detention to this effect.

<<6282.96;6286.84;en>>
He did not want to be transferred to the European part of the kingdom.

<<6286.84;6288.84;en>>
He wanted to be transferred to Aruba.

<<6288.84;6291.48;en>>
That wish was granted.

<<6291.48;6300.56;en>>
It has not been demonstrated why confinement to a custodial clinic in a different part of the world would have been more beneficial to Mr. Murray's rehabilitation than placement

<<6300.56;6303.84;en>>
in a prison in his country of residence.

<<6303.84;6307.28;en>>
And that, in effect, is our conclusion.

<<6307.28;6315.16;en>>
What matters, surely, is not so much the accessibility of treatment per se, but its effectiveness.

<<6315.16;6320.92;en>>
And if that effectiveness is not shown, we believe that that is the key issue in this case.

<<6320.92;6323.6;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court, I thank

<<6323.6;6323.6;en>>
you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<6325.12;6328.8;en>>
Thank you. I have a further point for the applicants.

<<6328.8;6334.72;en>>
Mr. Böcker, you have clarified what I called earlier the financial point,

<<6334.72;6356.08;en>>
the additional point you raised, and you have developed that orally, so I take for granted that you will not produce a further document on that, which means that the applicants, since this is a new argument, should have now the possibility, very briefly, just to answer this specific point.

<<6356.08;6372.32;en>>
In the alternative, if you do not want to reply now, orally, I will grant you leave to file a very small observation concerning this specific point within two weeks, and of course this will also be transmitted to the government.

<<6372.32;6381.64;en>>
But I need to give you the opportunity to respond to that additional argument, which has been developed for the first time now in the second round.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<6382.79;6388.71;en>>
Mr President, we will be happy to leave this question to the wisdom of your court.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<6392.2;6396.7;en>>
Thank you very much and we have now come to the end of the hearing.

<<6397.7;6402.7;en>>
I thank the parties for their interventions and answers to the court's questions.

<<6404.2;6406.2;en>>
The court will now deliberate on the merits.

<<6407.2;6412.7;en>>
The judgment will be delivered later and the parties will be informed of the date of delivery.

<<6412.7;6415.7;en>>
I declare the hearing closed.

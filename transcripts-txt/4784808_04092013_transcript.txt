La Cour!

<<67.58;69.58;en>>
Please be seated.

<<69.58;80.54;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the admissibility and merits in the case of Center for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu against Romania.

<<80.54;95.44;en>>
The case was lodged on the 2nd of October 2008 with the court under Article 34 of the Convention by a Romanian NGO, the Center for Legal Resources, on behalf of the late Mr. Valentin Câmpeanu,

<<95.44;99.78;en>>
who was a national of Romania. The application was allocated to the third

<<99.78;109.18;en>>
section of the court, which on the 19th of March 2013 decided to relinquish jurisdiction in favor of the Grand Chamber.

<<109.18;131.5;en>>
On the 14th of October 2011, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights exercised his right to submit written observations and on the 13th of April 2013 he expressed the wish to take part in the hearing by virtue of Rule 44, paragraph 2, of the rules of the court.

<<131.5;155.28;en>>
The President of the Grand Chamber granted leave to the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, the Euro Regional Center for Public Initiatives, the Human Rights Watch, and the Mental Disability Advocacy Center to submit written comments as third parties by virtue of Rule 44, paragraph 3, of the rules of court.

<<155.28;165.26;en>>
The government are represented by their agent, Ms. Catrinel Brumar from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, assisted by Mr.

<<165.26;171.92;en>>
Gabriel Caian, counsel and by Mr. Dragoș Dumitrache, co-agent.

<<171.92;176.96;en>>
The applicant is represented by Mr. Georgiana Iorgulescu,

<<176.96;180.58;en>>
executive director, and by Mr. Georgiana Pascu,

<<180.58;191.08;en>>
program manager of the Center of Legal Resources, who are assisted by Mr. Constantin Cojocariu, lawyers of inter-rights.

<<191.08;197.6;en>>
The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Nils Muižnieks,

<<197.6;200.46;en>>
is assisted by Ms. Isil Gachet,

<<200.46;205.58;en>>
director of the Commissioner's Office, and by Ms. Anne Weber,

<<205.58;207.56;en>>
advisor.

<<207.56;213.52;en>>
I welcome the representatives in the name of the court.

<<213.52;230.56;en>>
I would explain that in addition to interpreting in the two official languages of the court, English and French, interpreting into Russian has been authorized for the benefit of the group of Russian attorneys who are on a study visit to the court.

<<230.56;243.66;en>>
That interpreting is not arranged by the court, and no transcription of the oral translation will be included in the official record of the proceedings.

<<243.66;256.54;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government, the representatives of the applicant, and the Commissioner for Human Rights, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<256.54;261.82;en>>
Mr. Brumar and Mr. Caian for the government will speak first.

<<261.82;268.38;en>>
Then Mr. Cojocariu and Ms. Iorgulescu will speak for the applicant.

<<268.38;273.1;en>>
And finally, the floor will be given to Mr. Muižnieks,

<<273.1;276.26;en>>
the Commissioner for Human Rights.

<<276.26;276.26;en>>
I call Ms. Brumar.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<281.53;283.47;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<283.47;287.21;en>>
Mr. President, honorable judges, what if the representatives

<<287.21;290.33;en>>
of the respondent states will begin with a confession?

<<290.33;296.21;en>>
The government could not but join the applicant in expressing their regret for the death of Mr. Kampan.

<<296.21;306.59;en>>
We are well aware that discussing circumstances leading to a human tragedy is a difficult task, as the emotional reactions surrounding this hearing plainly show it.

<<306.59;312.23;en>>
However, we trust that the court will carefully assess the legal arguments which my colleague, Mr. Kayan,

<<312.23;316.27;en>>
and I will develop before the grand chamber.

<<316.27;325.01;en>>
First, I will address the preliminary but crucial aspect, which is the legal standing of the non-governmental entity which brought the case before the court.

<<325.01;340.87;en>>
Subsequently, my colleague will address the special elements and the public interest issues invoked by the applicant in order to establish its claim to the recognition of locus standi, and briefly refer to certain aspects related to the merits.

<<340.87;351.51;en>>
The present case is generated by an application the non-governmental organization, Center for Legal Resources, lodged with the court on behalf of the late Mr. Valentin Kampan.

<<351.51;357.35;en>>
The application was filed following actions taken by the organization at domestic level.

<<357.35;364.11;en>>
Its demarches were initiated after having been informed that Mr. Kampan, whom its representative had briefly

<<364.11;367.75;en>>
seen during his hospitalization, had died.

<<367.75;373.91;en>>
The applicant association never established any contact other than this brief visual one with Mr. Kampan,

<<373.91;378.39;en>>
and had never had this particular situation on their agenda.

<<378.39;383.43;en>>
Obviously, this concisely resumed factual element raised the following question.

<<383.43;394.57;en>>
Does the non-governmental organization, Center for Legal Resources, have locus standi before the court for the purpose of acting on behalf of Mr. Kampan or not?

<<394.57;404.43;en>>
Clearly, the main concern raised by the case, which eventually led to the relinquishment of the jurisdiction in favor of the grand chamber, is this very question.

<<404.43;407.41;en>>
Mr. President, honorable judges, we strongly

<<407.41;420.67;en>>
argue that the applicant is neither a representative of a victim nor a victim, and that its initiative, although expressive of its goals, namely the protection of human rights, falls outside the purpose and the scope of the convention.

<<420.67;428.11;en>>
The government are well aware of the dynamic and evolving interpretation of the convention in the light of the present day conditions.

<<428.11;441.39;en>>
Moreover, the government could not ignore the finding of the court in cases like Loizidu or Bankovic and others, stating that the convention must be interpreted and applied to make its safeguards practical and effective.

<<441.39;464.71;en>>
We are also well aware of the fact that the idea of the convention being a living instrument was applied not only to its substantive provisions, but more relevantly to its interpretation of former Article 25, the current Article 34, given the special character of the convention as a constitutional instrument of European public order for the protection of individual human beings.

<<464.71;477.95;en>>
However, the government underlined that all these developments of the case law are and must be construed only in the context of the interpretation of the convention, which is the process of determining the meaning of a given text.

<<477.95;486.99;en>>
None of this guidance given by the court could, in the government's opinion, be considered to support an indirect conventional amendment.

<<486.99;497.35;en>>
In the light of these preliminary remarks, the interpretation we submit to the court is the one that prevents the neglect of both the wording and the spirit of Article 34.

<<497.35;510.35;en>>
Moreover, we firmly uphold that this interpretation is not a restrictive and technical approach that would deny the very essence of the rights under assessment or the broader interest for the human rights protection.

<<510.35;521.35;en>>
Nor do the government intend to escape scrutiny of their compliance with the obligation under the convention as the applicant and the third parties contend.

<<521.35;550.19;en>>
Given the applicant's written observation where it pleads for the recognition of a possibility for every non-governmental organization to petition the court in order to raise awareness on the potential violation of fundamental rights of third parties, the government consider that, in essence, the applicant pleads for the recognition of an actio popularis for the benefit of the non-governmental organization and, as a consequence, for the forsake of the victim concept.

<<550.19;575.51;en>>
Even if such a change in the approach of the victim concept were to be pursued by way of interpretation, it is to be emphasized that such a shift in the court's jurisprudence should not be the mere result of a reexamination of Article 34 in an isolated demarche, but one that is derived from the acknowledgment of the state parties' common understanding of the current content of the concept.

<<575.51;590.23;en>>
As the court has constantly held, an actio popularis was only accepted for the states in order to supervise each other under Article 33 and implies the waiver of the victim condition imposed by Article 34.

<<590.23;607.71;en>>
To leave aside the condition of claiming to be a victim for the third party means to put on equal footing the states and the non-governmental entities, which obviously benefit from a different treatment in terms of the right to individual recourse according to the intention and desire of the contracting parties.

<<607.71;623.15;en>>
It is our government conclusion at this general and preliminary level that the interpretation of the convention, although evolving and extensive, could not be divorced from the contracting parties' intention and understandings of the conventional goals.

<<623.15;636.03;en>>
It is useful to recall that during all three high-level conferences on the future of the European Court, the participating states reaffirmed their attachment to the right of individual application before the European Court.

<<636.03;666.47;en>>
The recurring use of the words attachment or reaffirmation of their commitment to the above-mentioned right clearly indicates that the 47 contracting parties still share 60 years after the entering into force of the convention the same understanding on the exercise of the individual petition only by an individual, non-governmental entity, or group of individuals that claim to be a victim, be it a direct victim, an indirect, or a potential one.

<<666.47;672.75;en>>
In assessing the victim status of the applicant, we find consistent support in the court's case law.

<<672.75;700.83;en>>
Thus, in the case of Goray Zlizariga and others, when taking into account the particular circumstances of the case, especially the fact that the applicant association was set up for the specific purpose of defending its members' interests before the courts, and that those members were directly concerned by the dam project, the court considered that the applicant association, together with its members, could claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34.

<<700.83;719.23;en>>
On the other hand, in the case of Fédération Chrétienne de Témoin de Gévaudan de France, the applicant, a national association representing Jehovah's Witnesses and complaining about a parliamentary report on sects, was considered not to be a victim, as it could not claim to have been directly affected by the measure in question.

<<719.23;733.07;en>>
In the Conca decision, the court allowed the preliminary objection of the respondent state in respect to the legal standing of a human rights organization, which complained on its own right, but also on behalf of the Conca family's members.

<<733.07;738.87;en>>
Persons of Roma ethnicity in a particular vulnerable situation who had been expelled from the territory.

<<738.87;756.35;en>>
This court reiterated that each applicant should be able to indicate that the alleged violation concerns him or her directly, and concluded that the organization could not pretend to be affected by the measures purportedly touching the individual's rights.

<<756.35;765.63;en>>
We know that the court has denied standing as applicants to non-governmental bodies set up with no other aim than to vindicate the rights of alleged victims.

<<765.63;771.59;en>>
And even to non-governmental organizations whose very purpose was to defend human rights.

<<771.59;791.51;en>>
Thus, in the case of Adarossi, the court, although noting the important role played by the applicant associations in providing assistance to care for people in a vegetative state, considered that the impugned acts, namely the decision of the Milan Court of Justice, could not actually have any impact on their activities.

<<791.51;812.71;en>>
Turning to the legal standing in terms of the conventional standards as developed by the court in its case law, we recall that the indirect victim is described as an individual who is not directly affected by a particular measure or omission, but who may nevertheless be affected by the violation of the conventional rights of another person.

<<812.71;821.79;en>>
Still in this hypothesis, the court also assesses the valid personal interest that the applicant could put forward in order to legitimize her position.

<<821.79;838.59;en>>
According to the court, an indirect victim situation may often occur in respect of close family members, but it could also include other third parties as long as there is a sufficiently proven legal or factual link between the person and the indirect victim.

<<838.59;855.07;en>>
This hypothesis still requires that the indirect victim provides sufficient evidence of a valid personal interest, more precisely, the existence of a link and the ability of the alleged violation to reflect its effect on his or her situation.

<<855.07;868.99;en>>
At this point of our oral submission, we have to stress that the applicant association invokes in its complaint and all the subsequent observations solely the violation of fundamental rights of the late Mr. Campan.

<<868.99;875.39;en>>
No allegation refers to its own rights that would have been affected or disrespected.

<<875.39;885.19;en>>
In the light of the case law cited above, the government conclude that the applicant organization cannot pretend to be considered a direct victim.

<<885.19;892.43;en>>
At the same time, no indication on the existing link between the applicant and Mr. Campano

<<892.43;894.91;en>>
emerges from those observations.

<<894.91;900.39;en>>
The applicant itself acknowledges that its representation only briefly saw Mr. Campano

<<900.39;906.55;en>>
and that its initial attempt to establish contact with him took place only after his death.

<<906.55;914.95;en>>
As there is no submission that a personal link was involved, we will concentrate on whether a potential legal or factual link exists.

<<914.95;937.47;en>>
According to the Becker and Skudager decisions, for a person to invoke the status of indirect victim, it is necessary to prove that by virtue of a presumably valid act, he or she was entrusted with the care or the protection of the interests of the direct victim who is unable to complain himself or herself.

<<937.47;943.39;en>>
A contrario, the applicant association has never been entrusted with the care of Mr. Campano

<<943.39;944.75;en>>
in any way.

<<944.75;957.83;en>>
In these circumstances, we consider that the applicant is not a victim, neither in its direct nor its indirect capacity, and respectfully ask the court not to depart from its constant findings on this matter.

<<957.83;966.71;en>>
Turning to the representative status of the applicant, we would like to reiterate that, beside the absence of a traditional empowerment emanating from Mr. Campano

<<966.71;975.91;en>>
before his death, no other circumstances were invoked in the present case to show at least the prima facie written evidence concerning representation.

<<975.91;991.99;en>>
As large and non-formalistic as the notion of representation is conceived at the European level, it is undeniable that some form of authorization, at least conferred by law or recognized by domestic authorities, should exist and be presented.

<<991.99;1010.19;en>>
Although acknowledging that the representation before the European court has a less formalistic implication than under the domestic law, the commission underlined that the representative should submit evidence showing that he is empowered to appear before the convention organs on the applicant's behalf.

<<1010.19;1023.15;en>>
If this condition is not met, the commission can only consider the application insofar as the representative himself claims to be a victim, either in his direct or indirect capacity.

<<1023.15;1038.19;en>>
The applicant association attempts to draw consequences on the recognition of legal standing from its involvement in criminal proceedings initiated before the investigative domestic authorities, as well as before the domestic courts.

<<1038.19;1054.47;en>>
Article 278, index 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides for the right to challenge in court the prosecutor's decisions, was the legal provision allowing the Romanian High Court to rule that the applicant is entitled to bring proceedings before it.

<<1054.47;1066.75;en>>
The High Court indicated that the wording, any other person, was intended to include moral persons, such as the applicant, which aim at raising awareness to the standards of protection of human rights.

<<1066.75;1079.11;en>>
Thus, the legitimate interest of the Center for Legal Resources was inferred from its statute and its involvement in the investigative stage of the proceedings by denouncing the alleged shortcomings.

<<1079.11;1088.91;en>>
It is obvious that the domestic law, as interpreted by the Romanian High Court, amounts to the acknowledgement of an actio popularis.

<<1088.91;1105.15;en>>
Notwithstanding the legitimatio ad causa given by the domestic law to the non-governmental entities in such cases, the government argue, in turn, that the very wording of the European Convention does not allow such a broad interpretation.

<<1105.15;1111.59;en>>
The government must also stress an essential aspect the applicant seems to interpret erroneously.

<<1111.59;1118.51;en>>
The national authorities never recognized that the applicant acted on behalf of the late Mr. Campano

<<1118.51;1122.19;en>>
or that the applicant is Mr. Campano's representative.

<<1122.19;1128.71;en>>
The applicant's position in the domestic proceedings was that of a person the interests of whom had been harmed.

<<1128.71;1140.11;en>>
The interpretation promoted by the High Court underlines that the general interest for the respect of the principle of legality is not in itself sufficient to justify a person's time.

<<1140.11;1151.43;en>>
In turn, the interest for the respect for human rights contained in the statute of a legal person and promoted through concrete actions before the domestic authorities could justify it.

<<1151.43;1159.03;en>>
Thus, the appeals lodged by the applicant were not examined as emanating from the representative of the victim.

<<1159.03;1176.55;en>>
This aspect is inferred from the very fact that the High Court did not see at any moment the appeals as being introduced by the injured party personally or through representation, but as pertaining to a person as any other person, the interests of whom had been harmed.

<<1176.55;1198.63;en>>
As to the influence of the domestic legislation on the court's evaluation of local standing, the commission pointed out the autonomous character of the concept of victim as it must be interpreted independently of concepts of domestic law concerning such matters as interest or capacity to take legal proceedings.

<<1198.63;1201.67;en>>
Mr. President, honorable judges, we strongly

<<1201.67;1213.75;en>>
consider that the interpretation of the convention must be prudent in order to avoid bringing about elements that were not intended to be included when the convention was drafted.

<<1213.75;1225.55;en>>
In this way, in the government's opinion, a line is thought to be drawn between judicial interpretation, which is permissible, and judicial lawmaking, which is not.

<<1225.55;1231.39;en>>
Having reached this stage of our oral submission, please allow me, Mr. President, to pass the floor

<<1231.39;1233.63;en>>
to my colleague, Mr. Kayan.

<<1233.63;1233.63;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<1239.6;1240.84;en>>
Thank you, Ms. Brumar.

<<1240.84;1241.84;en>>
I call Mr. Caian.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<1244.82;1249.82;en>>
Mr. President, Honorable Court, the Applicant Association invoked the existence

<<1249.82;1263.82;en>>
of special elements and the public interest in order to establish its claim on the recognition of locus standi. Three issues are emphasized by the applicant as special elements

<<1263.82;1270.82;en>>
that could and, in its opinion, should justify the granting of locus standi.

<<1270.82;1277.82;en>>
The situation of Mr. Campano, the role of NGOs in the protection of human rights,

<<1277.82;1282.82;en>>
and the interest of human rights exception from admissibility rules.

<<1282.82;1305.82;en>>
These elements, together with the interaction between the domestic and the conventional approach on legal standing, are considered sufficient elements to allow the construction of a new concept, which is the representation post mortem of the direct victim by a third party in the absence of any link between the victim and the representative.

<<1305.82;1311.82;en>>
The government do not dispute the fact that Mr. Campano was a vulnerable person,

<<1311.82;1315.82;en>>
that he was an orphan, and he had no legal guardian appointed.

<<1315.82;1338.82;en>>
Nevertheless, we consider that the issue of the personal vulnerable situation coming to the attention of a third party alone is not sufficient to transform the said third party into a representative in the absence of any link to the direct victim, be it representation or entrustment with the care of that person.

<<1338.82;1350.82;en>>
The applicant argues that the nonrecognition of representative status would allow the government to prevail itself of Mr. Campano's unfortunate situation in order

<<1350.82;1353.82;en>>
to avoid the court's scrutiny.

<<1353.82;1377.82;en>>
Following this argument would amount to disregarding that the scrutiny provided for by Article 19 of the Convention is defined by the competence rules contained in Terralia in Article 34, and that in the economy of the Convention, it is Article 34 that determines l'effet utile of Article 19.

<<1377.82;1406.82;en>>
As far as the general role of the nongovernmental organizations is concerned, while commending their participation in public affairs as essential for a democratic society and praising the work and commitment of the Applicant Association to the Protection of Human Rights, the government considered that their role alone could not determine such a fundamental shift in the understanding of the individual applicant concept.

<<1406.82;1418.82;en>>
Matter of fact, the Romanian legal framework allows the NGOs to participate and even to initiate human rights proceedings.

<<1418.82;1428.82;en>>
Specifically, the Romanian anti-discrimination legislation expressly allows the NGOs to engage in judicial proceedings on behalf of claimants.

<<1428.82;1443.82;en>>
As to the criminal proceedings pursuant to Article 221 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a criminal proceeding can be initiated following either a complaint or a denounce by any person or ex officio.

<<1443.82;1450.82;en>>
Thus, any person can denounce an alleged crime, including nongovernmental entities.

<<1450.82;1464.82;en>>
Furthermore, Article 278, Index I of the same Code, acknowledges legal standing to the victim and any other person the interests of whom have been harmed.

<<1464.82;1477.82;en>>
When dealing with the interests of human rights exception, the Court found that sometimes persons close to the victim have a legitimate interest in seeing to it that the justice is done even after the applicant's death.

<<1477.82;1493.82;en>>
Moreover, the conventional system's purpose is not only to provide individual relief, but also to determine issues on public policy grounds in the common interest, transcending the person and her or his interests.

<<1493.82;1509.82;en>>
Furthermore, the Court stated that there are general interests which entitle it to continue the examination of an application even if the conditions required by Article 37 for striking the case out have been fulfilled.

<<1509.82;1518.82;en>>
And we know that even in those cases, there were two fundamental aspects that entitled the Court to such a course of action.

<<1518.82;1533.82;en>>
First, it was the fact that convention's protection mechanism was put in motion by the victim of the violation, and then that the respect for human rights permitted the Court to continue the examination of the case.

<<1533.82;1547.82;en>>
It is only throughout the proceedings that the Court is allowed a more flexible way in applying the criterion concerning the maintenance on its docket of an application by an individual.

<<1547.82;1554.82;en>>
The initial part we dare to affirm is non-negotiable for a flexible interpretation.

<<1554.82;1574.32;en>>
It is correct that the applicant assumed in the domestic legal order the position of a denouncer of violations and its actions seen in overall context and bringing to the attention of the national authorities a general situation encountered in a public institution.

<<1574.32;1590.82;en>>
However, as opposed to the cases mentioned by the applicant, such as the case of Karnar versus Austria, where the Court applied the interest for human rights exception, in the present case the proceedings were initiated only after the victim's demise.

<<1590.82;1603.32;en>>
On the substance of the interest of human rights exception, the applicant invokes explicitly two reasons that would require the examination of the case despite the absence of any standing on its part.

<<1603.32;1619.82;en>>
The general question of Romanian legislation in the field of treatment of persons with mental disabilities, including their involuntary hospitalization and their legal capacity, as well as the practice of implementation of the existing legislation.

<<1619.82;1628.82;en>>
The applicant considers this to be relevant for the Romanian system as well as for other national systems in the region.

<<1628.82;1644.32;en>>
Implicitly, the applicant acknowledges that the fundamental issue to be decided refers, in fact, to the recognition of standing before the Court for non-governmental entities beyond the clear requirements of Article 34.

<<1644.32;1656.82;en>>
It purportedly includes situations where these organizations consider that a complaint should be raised before the Court on behalf of vulnerable persons with no legal representative and no relative.

<<1656.82;1673.32;en>>
The government first notes that the Court defines the important issue of general interest as an issue that could contribute to elucidate, safeguard, and develop efforts of protection under the Convention. In the case of CB v. Romania, for example,

<<1673.32;1683.82;en>>
the Court considered of general interest the fact that its analysis concerns for the first time a piece of Romanian legislation.

<<1683.82;1707.82;en>>
A topical general interest affecting more than one State was also identified in Karnal case, where the Court considered that the subject matter of the application involved a recognition of general interest not only for Austria but also for other States' parties to the Convention.

<<1707.82;1726.82;en>>
In contrast to these hypotheses, we argue that the general interest raised by this case was already identified and analyzed by the Court in various judgments delivered against Romania or against other countries.

<<1726.82;1742.82;en>>
Thus, as far as the case law relating to Romania is concerned, we recall that the various issues identified by the applicant have already been addressed by the Court and largely cover the relevant period described by the applicant.

<<1742.82;1751.82;en>>
The execution of these judgments is presently under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers. As the applicant pointed out, currently it can get involved in the

<<1751.82;1762.32;en>>
execution phase and submit communications to the Committee of Ministers on the stage and scope of these executions.

<<1762.32;1775.32;en>>
We also recall that the Court has already considered situations concerning the plight of vulnerable people placed in large-scale institutions in other countries in the region.

<<1775.32;1779.32;en>>
Stanev v. Bulgaria is just an example.

<<1779.32;1802.82;en>>
Acknowledged by all participating States to the Interlaken and Brighten conferences, as an effect of the authoritative character of the interpretation the Court gives to the Convention, such considerations are taken into account by all parties where the same problem of principle exists within their own legal system.

<<1802.82;1820.82;en>>
Therefore, the evaluation already made by the Court in its previous judgments contributes to the acknowledgement of general interest issues without the need for additional analyses and efforts. Furthermore, we contend that in the current case, one could not

<<1820.82;1834.82;en>>
identify a topical general interest given precisely the involvement of other international mechanisms for the protection of human rights, especially the rights of disabled people.

<<1834.82;1841.82;en>>
Thus, the circumstances that surrounded Mr. Campiano's death were documented, reported

<<1841.82;1846.82;en>>
and examined by the European Committee for Prevention of Torture.

<<1846.82;1870.82;en>>
Based on the report issued in 2006 after its 2004 visit, the national authorities took various steps to make sure that a similar violation would not occur in the future in the Poiana Mare Hospital. As a matter of fact, as early as 2005, the Romanian authorities

<<1870.82;1877.82;en>>
addressed the specific recommendations of the CPT. They informed the Committee on the

<<1877.82;1895.82;en>>
subsequent developments, and all information is either publicly available on the CPT's website or already presented to the Court in the initial written submissions of the Government in this case. On a more general note, the Government would

<<1895.82;1911.82;en>>
also like to refer to the 2013 UN Universal Periodic Review, which acknowledged positive developments concerning the situation of disabled persons in Romania. Still, further improvements

<<1911.82;1934.82;en>>
are necessary, and some of the recommendations encourage Romania to facilitate the greater integration and participation in society of people with disabilities, and in particular implement strategies that will achieve a substantial reduction in the number of people with disabilities currently in institutional care. For these reasons, we strongly contend that

<<1934.82;1948.82;en>>
the respective interest is not topical anymore, so as to determine a shift of the Court's approach. The Applicant Association suggests in its ongoing media campaign that the general

<<1948.82;1961.82;en>>
interest is specifically related to the very issue of legal standing, to the NGO's right to represent vulnerable people such as Mr. Campiano in loco parentis, before the conventional

<<1961.82;1967.82;en>>
organs. In our opinion, the NGO's interest to represent vulnerable people before the

<<1967.82;1978.82;en>>
Court could not in itself justify the claimed shift of the Court's approach in terms of legal standing, all the more so as the domestic tools exist and are available.

<<1978.82;1985.82;en>>
As to the merits of the actions undertaken by the Applicant in the wake of Mr. Campiano's

<<1985.82;1998.82;en>>
death, we refer to our written submissions, which detailed and commented on the circumstances of the case. Those submissions should, in our view, be read in the light of the developments

<<1998.82;2010.82;en>>
occurred at the legislative and administrative level in the past ten years, for an accurate assessment of the existence of an actual general interest. In fact, the Applicant participated

<<2010.82;2029.82;en>>
in the drafting of the amendments to the primary and secondary legislation on mental health that include provisions on the involuntary hospitalization, and its implication was commended by the Romanian authorities. The entry into force of the new legislation on civil matters

<<2029.82;2043.82;en>>
offers specific provisions on guardianship for the protection of a person's interests after a tribunal established that the person lacked judgment. The new Code on Civil Procedure

<<2043.82;2055.82;en>>
provides for the establishment of special provisional guardianship in case of judicial proceedings. The functions of guardian are accomplished by an attorney appointed by the

<<2055.82;2059.82;en>>
Court from a list specially drawn up by each Bar Association.

<<2059.82;2085.82;en>>
The legislation adopted in 2006 for the promotion of the rights of disabled people responds to the need to involve the person in the decision-making process by promoting the individual personalized support, the choice of the least restrictive alternative in the determination of the needs of the person, the prevalence of the person's interests.

<<2085.82;2094.82;en>>
Mr. President, Honorable Judges, in light of the above, we respectfully invite the Court

<<2094.82;2113.82;en>>
to consider that the applicant does not have locus standi within the meaning of Article 34, and that no particular ground relating to respect for human rights as defined in the Convention requires it to continue the examination of the application. Accordingly,

<<2113.82;2119.82;en>>
the Government kindly invites the Court to dismiss the application as inadmissible.

<<2119.82;2119.82;en>>
Thank you.

Thank you Mr Caian, I call Mr Cojocariu.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<2127.62;2134.62;en>>
Mr. President, honorable judges, together with my colleagues from the Center for Legal

<<2134.62;2138.43;en>>
Resources, I have the privilege to make the following submission.

<<2138.43;2145.43;en>>
Valentin Kampan was an HIV positive and intellectually disabled teenager. His mother abandoned him

<<2145.43;2151.7;en>>
at birth and his father was unknown. He spent his childhood in children's institutions.

<<2151.7;2158.11;en>>
When he turned 18, social services decided that he had to go to an adult's institution.

<<2158.11;2172.34;en>>
On 5 February 2004, Kampan was brought to the Cetate Social Care Home in a state of health described as stable at the time. Within two weeks, Valentin Kampan was dead.

<<2172.34;2185.11;en>>
My colleague, who is next to me now, Georgiana Pasch, saw Kampan on the last day of his life while he was alive, contrary to the government's claims. She found him in a room described

<<2185.11;2192.11;en>>
to her as a storage room, which lacked heating. His neglect was extreme. He was almost naked

<<2192.91;2198.18;en>>
and very thin. Although he could not feed himself and could not walk to the toilet by

<<2198.18;2203.51;en>>
himself, members of staff refused to help him. When confronted, they revealed that they

<<2203.51;2209.82;en>>
feared becoming infected with HIV. Upon leaving the hospital, the Center for Legal Resources

<<2209.82;2221.47;en>>
issued an urgent public appeal asking that Valentin Kampan be transferred to a medical facility that could provide him with urgency medical care. It was already too late. In

<<2221.47;2226.55;en>>
the evening of the day of the visit, he died and was buried on the grounds of the hospital.

<<2226.55;2238.66;en>>
Valentin Kampan's death occurred against the background of a huge rise of patient mortality at the Poana Mare Hospital. It was not an isolated case. Against a nominal capacity

<<2238.66;2255.47;en>>
of 500 beds, the hospital reported 68 deaths in 2002, 87 deaths in 2003, and 28 deaths in the first months of 2004, including Valentin Kampan himself. Most of these deaths occurred

<<2255.7;2260.18;en>>
during the cold season. Authoritative sources, such as the Committee for the Prevention

<<2260.18;2270.59;en>>
of Torture and others, noted that many of these deaths were due to cold, to hunger, and to substandard medical treatment. The government claimed that they addressed the

<<2270.59;2275.82;en>>
situation. The fact is that no one has been held responsible for these deaths to this

<<2275.82;2281.07;en>>
day. This is the reason why this case has reached the Court. The lack of any redress

<<2281.07;2287.03;en>>
for violations of basic rights committed against people with disabilities put away in institutions.

<<2287.03;2291.78;en>>
I will address the question of admissibility to the present application. My colleague,

<<2291.78;2298.74;en>>
Georgiana Jorgulescu, from the Center for Legal Resources, will then speak about the merits of the case.

<<2298.74;2309.66;en>>
We ask that the indirect victim — there are a number of ways in which CLR standing may be recognized before this Court. The most convenient way we submit is that the Court

<<2309.66;2326.59;en>>
recognizes that — or that the Court extends indirect victim status to third parties in the exceptional situation where the direct victim had died and where they did not have known relatives or other formal sources of representation. This should particularly

<<2326.59;2337.59;en>>
apply to situations where the person has died while in the State's care, and it is alleged that they died as a result of the State's actions or inactions.

<<2337.59;2347.82;en>>
The Court has applied its admissibility rules flexibly in the interest of ensuring effective protection of the human rights included in the Convention. Amongst others, the Court

<<2347.82;2363.11;en>>
has developed the notion of indirect victims primarily in the context of Article 2, although not exclusively, allowing relatives to bring cases on behalf of those who died or who disappeared. In the majority of cases, recognizing that relatives

<<2363.11;2374.39;en>>
have standing to act on behalf of the deceased is sufficient in order to ensure effective scrutiny. On the other hand, it is indisputable that among people with

<<2374.39;2392.55;en>>
disabilities living in institutions for long periods of times — of time, there are some who have been abandoned by their relatives or who do not have any living relatives willing to act on their behalf. There is also extensive documentary

<<2392.55;2398.82;en>>
evidence showing that abuse is an inherent feature of institutional life. At some

<<2398.82;2411.3;en>>
institutions, like Poana Mare Hospital, abuse took — indeed, took extreme, even grotesque forms, as people died of hunger, cold, and lack of medical treatment.

<<2411.3;2426.24;en>>
It follows that if the notion of indirect victim is restricted to close relatives, this would have a disparate impact on persons with disabilities like Valentin Campiano, who, as he does, be unable to enjoy the rights provided for in the Convention.

<<2426.24;2431.43;en>>
Until a case decided in June this year, Nantjeva v. Others v. Bulgaria, the Court

<<2431.43;2442.11;en>>
has not examined, to the best of our knowledge, the issue of standing where there were no relatives to represent the victim, the direct victim of the Article 2 violation.

<<2442.11;2456.55;en>>
In Nantjeva, a human rights association, the Association for European Integration of Human Rights, complained about the deaths of 15 children and young people in a social institution. Although the Court declared inadmissible the case, insofar as it was

<<2456.55;2476.51;en>>
concerned to the Association, it explicitly left the door open for NGOs standing in exceptional circumstances in the interest of assuring the participation of the public and the representation of the victims who are not able to act to defend themselves. In particular, in Nantjeva, the Court criticized the Association

<<2476.51;2492.62;en>>
for not having raised the matter domestically before filing the application, and thus implied that its decision may have been different if the Association had not failed to bring domestic proceedings. That is the central consideration

<<2492.62;2509.4;en>>
on which this case can be distinguished from Nantjeva and can actually be distinguished from the general class of cases that the government has highlighted might reach in the future, should the notion of standing be expanded as we request.

<<2509.4;2542.07;en>>
The Center for – so as opposed to Nantjeva, the Center for Legal Resources have litigated this and other cases extensively in domestic courts and more broadly engaged in dialogue with the authorities in Romania on this topic, and yet they failed to secure any accountability whatsoever for the abuses that happened at Poiana Mare and at many other institutions throughout the year, including, obviously, for Valentin Campiano's death. Valentin Campiano's mother had been – had abandoned

<<2542.07;2547.18;en>>
him at birth. She never visited him. She died in 2000. His father is unknown.

<<2547.18;2552.78;en>>
She had no legal guardian at the time when he died. Therefore, there was no one to

<<2552.78;2563.97;en>>
complain on his behalf in relation to the circumstances in which he died other than the Center for Legal Resources. Undoubtedly, the lack of relatives or guardians

<<2563.97;2575.78;en>>
facilitated greatly the possibility of abuse and the authorities' – or the authorities' feeling of impunity. Although it argued that the Center for Legal Resources

<<2575.78;2586.74;en>>
lacked standing to initiate these proceedings, the government failed to answer a question of crucial importance. Who would be entitled to bring Campiano's

<<2586.74;2603.49;en>>
case to this Court other than the Center for Legal Resources so that the circumstances of his death may be properly scrutinized and the compliance of the State with its obligations under the Convention may be examined by this Court?

<<2603.49;2629.07;en>>
The Center for Legal Resources asserts its right – right to bring this case to this honorable Court on the basis that it had acted on Valentin Campiano's behalf both prior to his death by launching an appeal for his transfer out of the Poe Annamare Hospital and immediately afterwards and throughout the next four years, seeking accountability for his death before domestic courts. Its monitors had direct

<<2629.07;2634.47;en>>
contact with Valentin Campiano on the last day of his life. In addition, the Center

<<2634.47;2644.14;en>>
for Legal Resources has a longstanding experience in defending the human rights of persons with disabilities in institutions. Its standing to act on Valentin's

<<2644.14;2648.2;en>>
– Valentin Campiano's behalf was recognized at the domestic level.

<<2648.2;2674.22;en>>
We respectfully ask the Court to take due account of the fact that the High Court of Cassation and Justice, the highest court of the land in Romania, has recognized that the Center for Legal Resources qualified as, quote, a person whose interests have been injured, unquote, in accordance with Article 278, Index I of the Criminal Code. This referred to its standing to challenge decisions by the prosecutor

<<2674.22;2685.82;en>>
to not to indict – not to – not to indict the potential culprits in Campiano's case, but it was narrowly related to the circumstances of Campiano's death.

<<2685.82;2710.22;en>>
And actually, the High Court of Cassation and Justice has interpreted Article 278, Index I, in the light of Articles II and III of the Criminal Code, and it's not only of the European Convention on Human Rights, and indeed also of Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The government, in its submission before

<<2710.22;2727.39;en>>
the Grand Chamber and its oral presentation before this Court, suggested that Article 278, as interpreted, allowed for an axio popularis, which is – would not be permissible, as we accept in – in the convention system. This, however, is

<<2727.39;2733.66;en>>
not an axio popularis. We submitted to the Court another judgment, or it is not an

<<2733.66;2745.43;en>>
axio popularis in the sense of – in the sense of Article 278, Index I of the Romanian Criminal Procedural Code. The purpose of admissibility rules at the domestic

<<2745.43;2749.09;en>>
level and before this Court is the same or similar.

<<2749.09;2765.62;en>>
The High Court, turning back to the decision of the – of the High Court of Cassation and Justice, the High Court made it clear that Article 278, Index I, does not allow an axio popularis. The High Court denied standing to a parliamentarian group complaining

<<2765.62;2771.36;en>>
about alleged wrongdoing on the basis of public interest. In doing so, the High Court

<<2771.36;2798.18;en>>
of Cassation and Justice specifically stated that, quote, a concern for respect of the law is morally justified and laudable, but insufficient to produce eo ipso consequences in the field of procedural law, thus outruling the possibility of an axio popularis under Article 278, Index I of the Romanian Criminal Procedural Code. In its submission before the Grand Chamber, the government also argues that

<<2798.18;2814.97;en>>
the applicants sought interpretation of the victim status requirement that went beyond what the State initially committed to when signing up the European Convention on Human Rights. This, however, implies that the original intention of the drafters

<<2814.97;2826.34;en>>
of the Convention was to remove persons with disabilities without any relatives and who have been abandoned in institutions from the material scope of the Convention.

<<2826.34;2837.43;en>>
This, as I think we all can agree, is – would be, though, an unacceptable conclusion. We do not seek to impose new obligations on the State. We seek the effective

<<2837.43;2847.93;en>>
use of one of the most fundamental rights in the Convention in relation to some of the most vulnerable individuals of our societies. The government states that

<<2847.93;2858.64;en>>
this case further – further insists that this case should be dismissed as it represents an axio popularis. In particular, it relies on the Ada Rossi v. Italy decision,

<<2858.64;2879.39;en>>
which my esteemed colleague has referred to in – in her submission today, where associations of relatives of severely disabled persons, amongst others, complained about the decision of the Milan Court of Appeal granting the request to discontinue the life of a person in vegetative state filed by her father standing as guardian.

<<2879.39;2900.85;en>>
The present case can be distinguished from Ada Rossi on the basis that the Center for Legal Resources acted on Campano's behalf because of the absence – because of the absence of an officially appointed guardian, and not to challenge the actions of the official guardian, as the applicant associations did in Ada Rossi. In Ada Rossi,

<<2900.85;2921.01;en>>
this Court explained that, quote, the reason why the Convention does not allow an axio popularis is to avoid cases being brought before the Court by individuals complaining of the mere existence of a law applicable to any citizens of a country or of a judicial system to which they are not party, unquote. The present case seeks justice for a real

<<2921.01;2930.51;en>>
harm perpetrated against an identified individual and does not seek to challenge a generally applicable law. The government also asked the Court to separate the issue

<<2930.51;2940.26;en>>
of – issues of standing insofar they were concerned with Articles 2 and 3 on the one hand and Articles 5 and 8 on the other hand. The government relied mainly on – on

<<2940.26;2954.72;en>>
the notion that rights under the Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention are not subject to the Convention are not transferable and that, therefore, could not be invoked independently by the Center for – for legal resources. However, the issue of transferability

<<2954.72;2959.51;en>>
is not in itself decisive in this respect. The Court has in the past accepted

<<2959.51;2970.01;en>>
to hear cases filed by the – filed and – filed by the direct victim's relatives with respect to non-transferable rights filed under Articles 3, 5, or 6 of the Convention.

<<2970.01;2986.59;en>>
So the Court has applied a public interest, the – the interest of human rights criteria not only to cases that have been validly filed, but also to cases filed by relatives acting as indirect victims. And we refer to – to – for the relevant

<<2986.59;2991.89;en>>
case law, we refer to – to – to our written submissions. In the present case,

<<2991.89;3008.61;en>>
Valentin Campano's ability to access justice independently during his lifetime was severely impaired, as he had been confined in institutions and under the control of medical professionals. So I refer here to possible remedy that could exist while

<<3008.61;3014.22;en>>
Campano was alive as opposed to after he died. So while – while it was unknown

<<3014.22;3024.68;en>>
that his intellectual capacity was limited, he referred – he received no support to exercise his rights in the period preceding his – his death. And the Court

<<3024.68;3034.57;en>>
has applied a public interest to the case law in the period preceding his – his death. Furthermore, the abuses that formed the object of our claims under the other

<<3034.57;3044.61;en>>
Articles of the Convention, so Articles 3, 5, 8 of the Convention, are closely linked to his death. For example, the absence of adequate support and representation

<<3044.61;3059.53;en>>
which makes up the object of our Article 8 claim meant that Valentin Campano could not speak during his lifetime about the abuse directed against him, and that there was no one to complain on his behalf after he died. We maintain that the Center

<<3059.53;3075.74;en>>
for Legal Resources has standing as an indirect victim to complain on his behalf with respect to the violations that occurred during his lifetime, including violations of his Article 5 and 8 rights, because the details of these abuses came to surface only after he died.

<<3075.74;3085.12;en>>
We also submit that granting standing to the Center for Legal Resources to pursue this application is in the interest of human rights. The interest of human rights

<<3085.12;3094.97;en>>
concept in Article 37, paragraph 1 in Fine of the Convention does entitle the Court to depart from its current practice on admissibility. I will not dwell any longer

<<3094.97;3114.93;en>>
on this point due to time restrictions, particularly seeing that third-party interveners, and in particular the Commissioner for Human Rights, have highlighted the importance of the issues involved in this case and the importance of a judgment on the merits from the Court from the own end in this case. To conclude, we respectfully

<<3114.93;3129.39;en>>
argue that effective human rights protection requires that the Court recognize that the Center for Legal Resources has standing to bring proceedings on Valentin Campano's behalf in the specific and exceptional circumstances of this case.

<<3129.39;3139.51;en>>
One of the ways in which this could be achieved is by extending the indirect victim status to the Center for Legal Resources. We submit that this interpretation

<<3139.51;3154.94;en>>
of the indirect victim rule would not add to the State's obligations under the Convention, but that it would ensure a greater protection of the human rights of persons in an exceptionally vulnerable situation like Valentin Campano. The government cannot

<<3154.94;3160.56;en>>
be allowed to escape scrutiny of its compliance with its obligations under the Convention.

<<3160.57;3162.55;en>>
Thank you very much for your attention.

<<3173.05;3177.61;en>>
Mr. President, honorable judges, we formally renew our request

<<3177.61;3188.17;en>>
to this court to find violence of Article 2, 3, 5, 8 taken alone or jointly with Article 13 and 14.

<<3188.17;3199.89;en>>
I will refer in my intervention only to some aspect of the case that are subject of dispute between the parties or which are particularly central to a proper understanding of the case.

<<3199.89;3208.75;en>>
In particular, I will talk about some aspects of our submission under Articles 2, 3, 8, and 13 of the convention.

<<3208.75;3220.19;en>>
At the time when Valentin Campano arrived to the Tretata Social Care Home, his condition was described as stable, generally good state, good appetite, normal parameters.

<<3220.19;3232.87;en>>
In the months before the transfer, Campano has undergone several medical examinations in January, October, November 2003, all of which were generally positive.

<<3232.87;3240.51;en>>
Valentin Campano received regular antiretroviral medication prior to arriving at the Tretata Social Care Home.

<<3240.51;3253.55;en>>
The government acknowledged that it had an obligation to explain the circumstances in which Valentin Campano died, as he was under the control of its agents before he died.

<<3253.55;3270.45;en>>
The government had offered a totally unsatisfactory explanation, claiming in generic terms that HIV is a very serious progressive disease, which eventually kills the person who is infected with.

<<3270.45;3275.03;en>>
Besides being a huge stereotype, this is inaccurate.

<<3275.03;3280.23;en>>
People on drug treatment can now live as long as anybody else.

<<3280.23;3296.35;en>>
Other than relying on stereotypical views, the government failed to offer any explanation for the rapid deterioration in Campano's health after he was transferred to the Tretata Social Care Home, resulting in his death.

<<3296.35;3305.19;en>>
The reality is that Campano died from a lack of treatment and care at the Tretata Social Care Home and Poiana Mare Hospital.

<<3305.19;3311.55;en>>
We'd like to draw the court's attention to several factors leading to this conclusion.

<<3311.55;3323.99;en>>
First of all, the successive transfers between the placement to Tretata Social Care Home and then twice between Tretata and Poiana Mare Hospital were poorly planned and executed.

<<3323.99;3332.55;en>>
In particular, the social services were not able to identify any institution that was willing to accept him.

<<3332.55;3347.31;en>>
Presumably, in order to facilitate Campano's admission, social services arranged for his real intellectual disability to be omitted from his new handicap certificate issued in October 2003.

<<3347.31;3370.51;en>>
As a result, a few days after Valentin Campano arrived to the Tretata, actually in the paper it's about the arrival of the equipment on Valentin Campano, the staff, they are motivated, their inability to provide him with care as they lack the requisite skills to deal with his medical condition and accuse the social services for misleading them.

<<3370.51;3388.47;en>>
Furthermore, it is ironic that Valentin Campano ended up in the Poiana Mare Hospital in the circumstances in which this hospital initially refused to accept him on the basis that it lacked the skills and facilities to treat HIV-positive patients.

<<3388.47;3396.11;en>>
Second, essential drugs and medical history were not passed on during the transfer between institutions.

<<3396.11;3412.75;en>>
Valentin Campano's medical record, as well as the statements by staff involved in his transfer, indicates that his treatment with antiretroviral medication has been discontinued during most of its stay at Tretata Social Care Home.

<<3412.75;3429.39;en>>
The government stated that Valentin Campano's medical record at the Poiana Mare Hospital demonstrated he received antiretroviral medication during his stay there, and that in any event, he did not submit evidence to prove the contrary.

<<3429.39;3436.27;en>>
However, the government ignored our allegation that they were knowingly relying on forged document.

<<3436.27;3448.31;en>>
We pointed out that before the chamber, the government had submitted a duplicate medical record along with the original record available from the original file in domestic proceedings.

<<3448.31;3456.27;en>>
The documents submitted by the government included antiretroviral medication, whereas the original record did not.

<<3456.27;3472.91;en>>
Moreover, the information in the original record that Valentin Campano had not received antiretroviral medication during his stay at the Poiana Mare Hospital is confirmed by a police report dated 8 December 2005.

<<3472.91;3506.35;en>>
Third, the government's recurring suggestion that the Poiana Mare Hospital hygiene conditions were adequate, the alimentation and treatment were properly provided in accordance with the standard existing at the material time, is false, as demonstrated by the admissions of its agents in different circumstances, as well as by the findings of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and other international organizations, but also by the High Court Prosecutor's Office in 2006.

<<3506.35;3524.83;en>>
For its part, the Committee for the Prevention of Torture highlighted the link between the conditions at the Poiana Mare Hospital and the highly mortality rates between 2002 and 2004 in the report after his visit in 2004.

<<3524.83;3541.23;en>>
By the beginning of 2004, the Romanian authorities were fully aware that living standards and condition of care and treatment at Poiana Mare Hospital were extremely substandard, resulting in a very high patient mortality rate.

<<3541.23;3549.35;en>>
Starting in 1995, the Committee for the Prevention of Torture warned Romanian authorities about the living conditions.

<<3549.35;3555.99;en>>
And in response, in the same year, the Romanian government committed to close the hospital.

<<3555.99;3569.63;en>>
Governmental commissions visiting the hospital in July and September 2003 identified a long list of deficiencies and threatened to apply sanctions to those responsible.

<<3569.63;3595.87;en>>
It follows that the authorities were aware of the situation at the Poiana Mare Hospital and therefore had an obligation to take active measures to protect patients, including by stopping further admissions to the hospital, particularly so where, as in this case, the hospital lacked the necessary facilities and skills to provide valentine companion with the requisite care.

<<3595.87;3639.67;en>>
With respect to the obligation to investigate under Article 2 and 3 on the Convention, we would like to draw attention of the Court to the fact that by decisions in August 2005 and October 2007, the Dolj County Prosecutor's Office and the Calafate First Innocent Court highlighted major flaws into the official investigation, including the failure to gather essential evidence, such as medical records from institutions that were in contact with a valentine companion, prior to his arrival to the Cetate Social Care Home, and to question certain witnesses.

<<3639.67;3657.99;en>>
I want just to draw the Court's attention that my colleague Georgiana Pasco, she has never been asked to put down any kind of witnesses, or she was not invited to any hearings during the criminal proceedings in Romania.

<<3657.99;3676.67;en>>
So the failure to clarify central aspects of the case, including whether Tintanu received antiretroviral medication in the Cetate Social Care Home and the Poenamare Hospital, and the evolution of his state of health at the two institutions, and the treatment he actually received.

<<3676.67;3682.71;en>>
In view of these deficiencies, the two institutions returned the case for additional investigative measures.

<<3682.71;3694.67;en>>
Ultimately, although the flaws they identified were never remedied, the final decision of not indictment survived and became final on April 2008.

<<3694.67;3708.51;en>>
The government sought to rely on the investigation carried out by a commission working under the authority of the Dolt County Prefect in 2004, which concluded that nobody was liable for Campano's death.

<<3708.51;3731.71;en>>
The commission, however, was not independent and impartial, considering that it included a representative of the social services that acted as Campano's guardian up to the age of 18, which transferred Campano to the Cetate Social Care Home, and which failed to ensure he had a guardian after he turned 18.

<<3731.71;3746.95;en>>
The government equally invoked the conclusion of the report dated 20 July 2006 of the Disciplinary Commission of the Physicians Association, which also did not detect any wrongdoing in relation to Campano's death.

<<3746.95;3755.75;en>>
The government omitted, however, to mention the fact that the investigation authorities challenged this report, and that the challenge has been rejected as out of time.

<<3755.75;3762.79;en>>
Anyway, this body also lacked the guarantees of independence from undue influence required under Article 2.

<<3762.79;3774.79;en>>
As for the body normally entitled to carry out such examination, the Forensic Medicine Institute, its task was hampered by the restrictive scope of the questions.

<<3774.79;3781.75;en>>
It had to answer the fact that it did not have all relevant medical records at its disposal.

<<3781.75;3803.67;en>>
The bottom line in relation to Valentin Campano's death is the fact that the Cetate Social Care Home and Buena Mare Hospital clearly lacked the equipment and skills required to deal with an emergency situation, and that during the time of his hospitalization, he only received sedative medication and glucose drip.

<<3803.67;3822.79;en>>
An eminent independent medical expert, which we asked to look at Campano's medical file, concluded that a form of pneumonia, very common in HIV patients, certainly when antiretroviral treatment is substandard, it may well have been the cause of Valentin Campano.

<<3822.79;3831.59;en>>
This hypothesis is corroborated with the conclusion of the autopsy report, which points out pneumonia as a possible cause of death.

<<3831.59;3839.07;en>>
If that was the case, this condition was not diagnosed or treated at Buena Mare Hospital or Cetate Social Care Unit.

<<3839.07;3854.43;en>>
The medical expert consulted by the Center for Legal Resources concluded categorically that faulty medical supervision and substandard medical care demonstrating gross negligence ultimately resulted in Campano's death.

<<3854.43;3866.55;en>>
We therefore call on this Court to find that there have been violations of Article 2 and 3 of the Convention, both with respect to their substantive as well as to their procedural aspects.

<<3866.55;3878.47;en>>
Under Article 8 of the Convention, the government objected that we have not exhausted domestic remedies in this respect, as we don't raise our claims before the domestic courts before.

<<3878.47;3886.03;en>>
The government is making this submission for the first time during this proceeding, and it is stopped doing so.

<<3886.03;3887.93;en>>
The objection also lacks merit.

<<3887.93;3895.41;en>>
The Center for Legal Resources has complained explicitly and implicitly about all aspects of this complaint.

<<3895.41;3917.63;en>>
For example, in the initial complaint to the prosecutor's office in 2004, the Center referred explicitly to Valentin Campano's lack of involvement in the decision to transfer him between institutions prior to his death, as well as the authorities' failure to appoint a guardian, as we have been mandatory under the domestic law.

<<3917.63;3921.75;en>>
We argue that Article 8 was violated onto counts.

<<3921.75;3928.27;en>>
Although the government has not explained their objection to these claims, we wish to briefly reiterate them.

<<3928.27;3941.27;en>>
First, we argue that the state has a positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention to adopt legislation on legal capacity that is compliant with the court's own jurisprudence in the field, as well as international standards.

<<3941.27;3948.39;en>>
In this case, it is obvious that authorities have failed to appoint a guardian to Campano after he turned 18.

<<3948.39;3963.31;en>>
Guardianship is designed under Romanian legislation as a measure of protection, and guardians are supposed to ensure the rights of the word are adequately protected, eclodic, with respect to compulsory confinement and medical treatment.

<<3963.31;3975.91;en>>
The Romanian legislation, even though the government said we have new Romanian legislation, which is very new and very according to the court's jurisprudence, we may say no.

<<3975.91;3990.67;en>>
The legal capacity is not compatible with international legal standards, mainly because it only permits the measures of full incapacitation and placement under plenary guardianship with the attendant loss of rights.

<<3990.67;3999.59;en>>
In our case, Valentin Campano, guardians up until he was 18 exposed him to the abuses that eventually led to his death.

<<3999.59;4021.55;en>>
Finally, turning to our claims under Article 13 of the Convention, one central requirement is the state must take into account the fact that person may be personally incapable of using their procedural rights, and therefore they should take positive measure to ensure they benefit from redress from any abuses committed against them.

<<4021.55;4040.63;en>>
We reiterate our submission that Article 13, in conjunction with the obligation under Article 2 and 3, imposes an obligation of sound substance to ensure that such establishments are effectively monitored by independent authorities aiming at preventing ill treatment and other forms of abuse.

<<4040.63;4052.47;en>>
Romania does not yet have an adequate mechanism for monitoring places of detention, including the time of the establishment where Valentin Campano died.

<<4052.47;4063.75;en>>
Despite the fact that it is bound to do so according to the optional protocol to the Convention against Torture, it's Romania's sign in July 2009.

<<4063.75;4065.59;en>>
Thank you very much for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4067.46;4071.86;en>>
Thank you very much. I call Mr. Muižnieks.

[[ThirdParty;TP1]]

<<4075.97;4078.97;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court,

<<4078.97;4087.93;en>>
this is my first appearance before the European Court and the second time that the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights intervenes orally in a hearing before the Court.

<<4087.93;4099.65;en>>
This underlines the importance of this case, which will set the position of the Court regarding access to justice of some of the most vulnerable people in Europe, people with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities.

<<4099.65;4108.89;en>>
My intervention today is based on, both on observations submitted by my predecessor in October 2011, and on my own assessment of the situation.

<<4108.89;4122.93;en>>
Since the beginning of my mandate in April 2012, the rights of persons with disabilities have been a central focus of my work, as reflected in my visits to Austria, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, and Spain.

<<4122.93;4140.33;en>>
In the first half of 2012, my office published two issue papers addressing, respectively, the right of people with disabilities to live independently and be included in the community, and secondly, the right to legal capacity for persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities.

<<4140.33;4160.05;en>>
I've repeatedly highlighted the urgent need to ensure that persons with disabilities, in particular, persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, effectively enjoy their human rights on an equal basis with others, and the importance of guaranteeing participation of such persons in all decisions affecting their lives.

<<4160.05;4167.53;en>>
My overall assessment of the situation is that the living conditions of persons with disabilities are, in general, unsatisfactory.

<<4167.53;4171.33;en>>
Thousands of them are kept in old, secluded institutions.

<<4171.33;4178.71;en>>
School segregation still affects many children with disabilities, and discrimination in the job market is widespread.

<<4178.71;4191.89;en>>
International standards, in particular, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the CRPD, and the Council of Europe Disability Action Plan, enshrine far-reaching rights for persons with disabilities.

<<4191.89;4198.29;en>>
However, implementation has been slow and remains inadequate in all member states, without exception.

<<4198.29;4212.61;en>>
I've paid special attention to the situation of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, who constitute a particularly stigmatized and vulnerable group, and who continue to be deprived of their most basic human rights in many member states.

<<4212.61;4220.93;en>>
My main concern is that cases concerning human rights violations experienced by people with disabilities are often not brought to courts.

<<4220.93;4234.65;en>>
Access to justice for persons with disabilities, and in particular, intellectual disabilities, remains highly problematic, notably due to inadequate legal incapacitation procedures and restrictive rules on legal standing.

<<4234.65;4247.13;en>>
There's an urgent need to reform outdated and non-CRPD-compliant legal capacity legislation throughout Europe, especially through the establishment of supported decision-making.

<<4247.13;4259.05;en>>
The situation of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities and the protection of human rights in psychiatric care settings were addressed in two reports which followed my visits to Austria and the Czech Republic.

<<4259.05;4269.25;en>>
In Austria, there's currently a debate about legal capacity and the introduction of supported autonomous decision-making for persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities.

<<4269.25;4284.49;en>>
An interesting aspect I noted in the Austrian system is that patients' ombudsmen, ombudspersons, act as legal representatives in court proceedings for involuntary placement and also support individuals during their stay in hospitals or psychiatric departments.

<<4284.49;4289.45;en>>
In principle, their tasks end by law when the individual dies in an institution.

<<4289.45;4300.65;en>>
However, in 2010, the Austrian Supreme Court of Justice held that their power of representation remains in such cases as otherwise there would be a gap in human rights protection.

<<4300.65;4304.93;en>>
And I think that is what we're discussing today, is gaps in human rights protection.

<<4304.93;4319.85;en>>
While in the Czech Republic, I expressed concerns about the generalized practice of the courts to fully deprive persons with disabilities of their legal capacity, despite their de facto ability to perform a series of the acts required in daily life.

<<4319.85;4336.41;en>>
Therefore, I warmly welcome the legislative changes adopted by the Czech government, which abolish the full deprivation of legal capacity as of 1 January 2014 and introduce a system of supported decision-making as an alternative to the guardianship system based on substitute decision-making.

<<4336.41;4348.57;en>>
The failure of the state to take appropriate measures to provide access for persons with disabilities to the support they may require in exercising their legal capacity raises an issue under Article 8 of the Convention.

<<4348.57;4355.49;en>>
A positive obligation on the state to provide such support can be inferred from international law.

<<4355.49;4362.51;en>>
This entails an obligation to initiate incapacitation procedures if necessary and to appoint a legal representative.

<<4362.51;4369.21;en>>
Support is of the utmost importance in order to give access to justice to people with intellectual disabilities.

<<4369.21;4375.01;en>>
Without assistance, these persons are often not in a position to make themselves heard.

<<4375.01;4388.13;en>>
I'm aware that Article 34 of the Convention requires that an applicant should claim to be a victim of a violation of one of the rights set forth in the Convention, that is, to have been directly affected by the violation alleged.

<<4388.13;4399.25;en>>
Nevertheless, the Court has permitted applications by indirect victims in a number of cases, for instance, close relatives of a deceased person alleging violations of the right to life.

<<4399.25;4411.29;en>>
The Court has also accepted to examine cases in which an applicant had died in the course of the proceedings or cases in which the applicant had died before the submission of the application by close relatives.

<<4411.29;4424.05;en>>
However, the Court has never had the opportunity to examine a case concerning a person who died before the submission of an application in the absence of any heir or close relative and with no legal representative.

<<4424.05;4429.25;en>>
This raises a question of the representation of a direct victim by a third party.

<<4429.25;4435.17;en>>
A few comments on the principle of effectiveness and the need to adapt standing requirements.

<<4435.17;4441.69;en>>
The Convention is a lawmaking treaty, the object and purpose of which are the protection of individual human rights.

<<4441.69;4450.21;en>>
This requires that the Convention's provisions be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective.

<<4450.21;4470.13;en>>
In my view, a strict application of standing requirements to persons with disabilities, and in particular intellectual disabilities, would have the unfortunate effect of depriving a particularly vulnerable group of any reasonable prospect of seeking and obtaining redress for violations of their human rights set forth in the Convention.

<<4470.13;4478.93;en>>
It would also run counter to the Convention's objective of preventing the occurrence or recurrence of human rights violations by the State's parties.

<<4478.93;4492.77;en>>
With a view to safeguarding the Convention's effectiveness at national level, I think that in exceptional circumstances, which the Court may wish to define, NGOs should be able to lodge applications with the Court on behalf of victims.

<<4492.77;4498.89;en>>
Possible factors to be taken into account are listed in the written observations submitted by my predecessor.

<<4498.89;4503.37;en>>
I should like to stress that the case at hand possibly combines all of these factors.

<<4503.37;4509.93;en>>
Moreover, in its recent judgment of Nenshev and others v. Bulgaria, already mentioned by the applicant,

<<4509.93;4523.97;en>>
the Court recognized that the interest of justice and the necessity to effectively protect individual rights and freedoms might require exceptional measures to ensure the representation of victims who are not in a position to defend themselves.

<<4523.97;4533.37;en>>
In this context, there should be at least an attempt to raise the issue at domestic level by the NGO wishing to lodge a complaint before the European Court on behalf of a victim.

<<4533.37;4537.85;en>>
In my view, this could be a factor that could guide you in today's discussions.

<<4537.85;4552.05;en>>
This would be in line with a tendency in domestic law to accept that a third person or organization takes legal action in the name of victims of alleged human rights violations in domestic courts, especially in cases concerning vulnerable groups of people.

<<4552.05;4557.77;en>>
There's a trend at the European level to expand legal standing, especially in anti-discrimination law.

<<4557.77;4575.01;en>>
For example, Article 7 of the EU's racial equality directive obliges EU member states to ensure in accordance with national law that associations, organizations, or other legal entities may engage in judicial or administrative proceedings on behalf of or in support of victims.

<<4575.01;4583.33;en>>
I think it's high time that we recognize the invaluable contribution made by NGOs to the effective protection of human rights at national level.

<<4583.33;4595.09;en>>
At European level, the Court's own case law on questions relating to the human rights of persons with disabilities has evolved considerably in recent years, thanks precisely to the intervention of NGOs.

<<4595.09;4603.45;en>>
Many of these cases only reached Strasbourg thanks to the legal support and advocacy provided by NGOs when the applicants had no one else to turn to.

<<4603.45;4612.89;en>>
Many of them had been stripped of their legal capacity by domestic courts in ways that violate the Convention and essentially had no access to justice in their home country.

<<4612.89;4621.79;en>>
NGOs can sometimes provide the support these persons need to have their voices heard, to seek justice, and to have their Convention rights respected.

<<4621.79;4627.09;en>>
People turn to the European Court of Human Rights because they feel unable to find justice at home.

<<4627.09;4638.81;en>>
However, access to justice for persons with intellectual and mental disabilities remains a central concern, particularly for those residing in large, remote, and impersonal psychiatric institutions.

<<4638.81;4653.45;en>>
Achieving equal rights for persons with disabilities will require removing the barriers that hinder them from accessing courts to claim their human rights and fighting against their isolation in institutions or in the back rooms of family homes.

<<4653.45;4662.01;en>>
Failure to ensure that vulnerable persons have effective access to justice will allow the abuses committed against them to continue with impunity.

<<4662.01;4679.05;en>>
In conclusion, in order to prevent and put an end to the abuses committed against people with disabilities, the important role played by NGOs in shedding light on the human rights violations experienced by vulnerable persons and facilitating their access to justice must be officially recognized.

<<4679.05;4693.57;en>>
Allowing NGOs to lodge applications with the court in exceptional circumstances on behalf of persons with disabilities, and in particular intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, is fully in line with the principle of effectiveness in which the Convention is grounded.

<<4693.57;4693.57;en>>
Thank you for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4697.23;4700.63;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. Muižnieks.

<<4700.63;4703.75;en>>
I turn now to my colleagues.

<<4703.75;4705.67;en>>
Are there any questions?

<<4705.67;4710.11;en>>
Judge López Guerra first, please.

[[Judge;Luis López Guerra]]

<<4711.02;4715.7;en>>
Thank you. My question is first mostly to the government.

<<4715.7;4722.42;en>>
Who was the legal representative, if any, of Mr. Câmpeanu?

<<4722.42;4726.86;en>>
Or in other words, did Mr. Câmpeanu have any legal representative?

<<4726.86;4735.22;en>>
And in that case, who was the representative? And the other question is for the applicant,

<<4735.22;4745.22;en>>
concerning the events of the 20th February 2004, I mean the last day of the life of Mr. Câmpeanu.

<<4745.22;4754.82;en>>
It seemed that, well, he was still alive. A team of monitors of the CLR visited the Poiana Mare Hospital.

<<4754.82;4766.82;en>>
They saw directly Mr. Câmpeanu. They assessed his situation. And then they requested for him to be

<<4766.82;4777.82;en>>
translated to another hospital. And the request was rejected. And it seems that this team made a report on the facts.

<<4777.82;4787.82;en>>
Now, my question is possible at this time, so many years ago. First, did the centre have some previous knowledge

<<4787.82;4794.62;en>>
of the situation of Mr. Câmpeanu? Or what was the reason for the visit to the hospital?

<<4794.62;4805.82;en>>
Secondly, did the team then, after seeing Mr. Câmpeanu's situation, have a direct interview with the manager of the hospital?

<<4805.82;4822.82;en>>
In this case, did they have a direct answer to their request? Or was it just that the manager did not take any decision?

<<4822.82;4832.82;en>>
So, if possible, what were the terms of the relation of this team with the manager of the CLR, I mean of the hospital? Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4833.94;4837.86;en>>
Thank you. Judge Silvis, please.

[[Judge;Johannes Silvis]]

<<4839.52;4846.48;en>>
Thank you, Mr President. I have a question to the Government. The representatives of the

<<4846.48;4852.4;en>>
respondent state have referred to the mission of the Court under Article 34 of the Convention.

<<4852.4;4866.96;en>>
They have underlined the meaning of the victim concept and its restrictions when it comes to admissibility. There is, however, another element in Article 34 to which I want to draw attention.

<<4866.96;4889.64;en>>
Article 34 of the Convention on the Right of Individual Applications' last sentence reads, The High Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right. My question to the Government is related to that last sentence in particular, having in

<<4889.64;4896.72;en>>
mind that there is little room between the act and the omission. The Government acknowledge

<<4896.72;4910.88;en>>
the fact that Mr Câmpeanu was a particularly vulnerable person, that he was an orphan and that he had no legal guardian appointed when he turned 18. The Government note in their submissions

<<4910.88;4935.84;en>>
that the CLR had the possibility to ask the domestic courts the lifting of Mr Câmpeanu's legal capacity and to ask for the nomination of a tutor pursuant to Articles 143 and 115 of the Code of Family. How could the Centre have done so before having even monitored his existence?

<<4938.16;4968.56;en>>
Why should the State, on its own motion, not have taken the proper initiative to the appointment of a legal representative in order to secure that the vulnerable Mr Câmpeanu, who was confined and confronted with major decision-making concerning his health, would have had effective access to justice? In close connection to this, the matter can be raised whether a State that fails to

<<4968.56;4985.44;en>>
provide proper representation to vulnerable persons in a situation like Mr Câmpeanu's thereby in any way hinders the effective exercise of the right to bring an application to our Court.

<<4986.16;4994.16;en>>
Such hindrance may perhaps run against the obligation in Article 34, the last sentence.

<<4994.16;4997.92;en>>
Does the Government hold a view on this matter? Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<4999.28;5002.8;en>>
Thank you, Trash Silvis, this is Mark Villiger, please.

[[Judge;Mark Villiger]]

<<5005.82;5007.42;en>>
Thank you, President.

<<5007.42;5018.14;en>>
My question follows those of judges López Guerra and Silvis and concern the applicant's representation.

<<5018.14;5034.46;en>>
Had the applicant so wanted during his lifetime, could he in fact and in effect have obtained representation to defend his interests before domestic authorities and this court?

<<5034.46;5049.06;en>>
For example, could he during his lifetime in fact and in effect have obtained representation to file the complaints which the Center for Legal Resources is today raising before us?

<<5049.06;5049.06;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5050.0;5053.08;en>>
Thank you very much, Judge Villiger, Judge Šikuta.

[[Judge;Ján Šikuta]]

<<5055.38;5057.22;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<5057.22;5062.14;en>>
I do have two questions, one to the government and one to the applicant.

<<5062.14;5067.74;en>>
Both are focusing on procedural aspect of the case.

<<5067.74;5070.34;en>>
First question to the government.

<<5070.34;5103.82;en>>
We do have in our materials information that in its decision of 15th of June 2006 concerning a criminal complaint lodged by the same NGO, CLR, on behalf of another patient, PC, that had died at the same hospital, PM Hospital, the High Court of Cassation and Justice dismissed the prosecutor's objection on the lack of standing of the same NGO.

<<5103.82;5122.46;en>>
In its reasoning, the High Court held that the CLR did have local standing to pursue such proceedings deemed to elucidate the circumstances in which 17 patients had died at the same hospital in between January and February 2004.

<<5122.46;5136.18;en>>
The question is, what is the difference between today's case and the case of PC where the High Court of Cassation and Justice recognized local standing?

<<5136.18;5141.38;en>>
The second question is to the applicant.

<<5141.38;5148.14;en>>
And it concerns the exhaustion of domestic remedies.

<<5148.14;5162.98;en>>
In our case, in today's case, the prosecutor's office attached to the Calafa District Court appealed against the judgment.

<<5162.98;5174.1;en>>
On 4th of April 2008, the Dole County Court allowed the appeal, annulled the judgment delivered by the Calafa District Court, and rejected the complaint lodged by CLR.

<<5179.22;5202.38;en>>
Now, the court mainly relies on the conclusions of the forensic report and the autopsy report, as well as on the decision of the Doctors Association, and simply rejected it because there was no casual link between the medical treatment given by Mr. Câmpeanu and his death.

<<5202.38;5204.5;en>>
My question is procedural.

<<5204.5;5215.18;en>>
Why, in this case, CLR didn't go to the High Court of Cassation and Justice like CLR did in the case of PC?

<<5215.18;5215.18;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5217.29;5218.39;en>>
Thank you, Judge Bianku.

<<5222.58;5223.58;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<5223.58;5226.94;en>>
I have a question for the applicant's representatives.

<<5226.94;5234.94;en>>
If I understand well from the case file, at the domestic level, you're recognized as legal representatives of Mr. Câmpeanu.

<<5234.94;5243.18;en>>
And today, before us, you are claiming to be recognized as indirect victims on the case.

<<5243.18;5254.5;en>>
Could you explain to me the change on your position, why you claim today to be recognized as indirect victims, especially bearing in mind the Nancella case that you mentioned as well?

<<5254.5;5254.5;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5254.98;5257.94;en>>
Thank you. Judge Pinto de Albuquerque, please.

[[Judge;Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque]]

<<5257.94;5264.94;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President. The government did not address the merits of the case.

<<5264.94;5282.32;en>>
Thus, the silence of the government should be read as an acknowledgment of the violations imputed regarding Articles 2, 3, 5, and 8, leaving aside, of course, the question of admissibility of complaint.

<<5282.32;5285.28;en>>
This is a question addressed to the government, of course.

<<5285.28;5285.7;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5288.19;5292.11;en>>
Thank you. Are there any other questions? No.

<<5292.11;5311.11;en>>
So I propose that we suspend the hearing for 20 minutes to allow parties to prepare their response to the questions and their response to the arguments put before the court during the first round.

<<5311.11;5311.11;en>>
The hearing is suspended.

La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5404.48;5410.98;en>>
The hearing is now resumed and I call Ms. Brumar, please.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<5413.94;5415.94;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<5423.72;5426.68;en>>
Mr. President, honorable members of the court,

<<5429.66;5442.0;en>>
in responding to the questions put forward before the break, as the government indicated in the written submissions, Mr. Campano was not beneficiating

<<5442.0;5446.02;en>>
at the time of his death of the guardianship measure of protection.

<<5447.58;5466.24;en>>
This was this aspect, which undoubtedly is a shortcoming in the authorities conduct, is explainable by the short lapse of time between his discharge from the child protection institution and the moment of his death.

<<5466.24;5488.94;en>>
Still, in terms of law, as the law provided then, and as the law provides with more clarity at this at the present moment, Mr. Campano was to be evaluated

<<5488.94;5503.46;en>>
in terms of existence of judgment and a proposal for the institution of a guardian was to be forwarded to a judicial tribunal.

<<5503.46;5513.22;en>>
If the court was to decide that Mr. Campano lacked judgment,

<<5513.22;5526.22;en>>
it would have established a guardianship.

<<5526.22;5541.78;en>>
The question referring to the fact, to the possibility for the applicant to have obtained the representation of Mr. Campano,

<<5541.78;5546.78;en>>
I am sorry if I was not very clear in my oral submission.

<<5549.52;5562.9;en>>
I did not intend to put on the applicant the burden of requiring and obtaining the guardianship of Mr. Campano.

<<5562.9;5610.94;en>>
We were just mentioning the legal possibilities offered by the current civil code in the domestic law that provides for the establishment of guardianship by the guardianship court after a concrete evaluation of each case that comes to its attention through the action of authorities or at the request of a relative of a person that is allegedly lacking judgment.

<<5615.54;5663.78;en>>
As far as the right of individual recourse is concerned and the government's interpretation of Article 34, in our opinion, the last sentence of Article 34 that dealing with the effectiveness of the exercise of the right to individual petition by referring specifically to this right, I quote, this right, is confined to the framework that is established by the previous sentence and the previous sentence is dealing precisely with the two requirements for a possible petition before the court.

<<5663.78;5688.0;en>>
That is, that an entity addressing the court be placed in one of the three categories, individuals, non-governmental organizations or group of individuals, and claiming to be a victim.

<<5688.0;5724.3;en>>
So it is our understanding that when such a possible applicant claiming to be a victim, and we recognize, we acknowledge the fact that the victim can be not only a direct one, but an indirect or potential one, is addressing the court, its exercise must be effective.

<<5725.04;5741.22;en>>
But we consider that the last sentence is referring to the exercise of the individual rights to petition as described by the first sentence.

<<5744.36;5792.7;en>>
As far as the position of the domestic courts is concerned, and answering the question on the difference between the present case and the high court's evaluation, as we noted in our oral submission, the high court, in recognizing the right of the applicant to challenge a prosecutor's decision before it, considered that the applicant can be qualified as a person, not the injured person, but any other person, the interests of whom had been harmed.

<<5794.4;5854.36;en>>
It is a person that is different from the injured party, or the representative of the injured party, that has a more general interest, and in this context, we place our affirmation that the domestic court sort of recognized an actio popularis for the non-governmental organizations, a larger category of persons who, because of the aspects inferred in their statute, because of their concrete demarches, and because the goals they are pursuing, can be considered to be affected in their interests by a certain prosecutor's decision.

<<5856.8;5905.32;en>>
That's the position of the Romanian high court, and it is different from the interpretation we give to Article 34, as the Romanian high court does not ask the petitioner to be a victim, but more largely to show that some of his concrete specific interests had been harmed, and this concept of interest is interpreted in a more extensive way than the concept of victim in Article 34.

<<5910.2;5926.64;en>>
If the, and I acknowledge the if in the beginning of my affirmation, if the procedure for the appointment of a guardian was finalized before Mr. Campanile,

<<5928.08;5960.08;en>>
his guardianship, according to domestic legislation, had the duty and was to perform the functions in order to satisfy his interests and to protect his rights, and a guardian was entitled to bring before domestic authorities claims regarding alleged affecting measures on Mr. Campanile's rights.

<<5966.84;5976.8;en>>
Another question was referred to the government silence on the merits of the case.

<<5976.8;5985.44;en>>
It was the government's choice to plead in the oral submissions on the.

<<5985.44;5985.6;en>>
It was internal, not the DA, so not in my domicile,

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<5985.03;5988.53;en>>
In this room, may I interrupt you for a short moment?

<<5988.53;5995.93;en>>
I just want to tell you that your time has almost expired and if you want to respond to all the questions, that you should be aware of that.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<5998.7;6031.66;en>>
It was the government's choice to plead more extensively on the question of competence, locus sandi, and admissibility as we identified, together with the special circumstances invoked by the applicant, some of them already present in the court's case law, as deserving of our primary attention.

<<6031.66;6070.74;en>>
Still, I recall that our written submission, the initial ones before the chamber and the submissions presented before the grand chamber this year in June, reiterate our position on the merits of the case and show our authority's position that actions were taken and assessment was made by the government for the benefit of Mr. Kampan,

<<6070.74;6083.58;en>>
not without acknowledging that there were certain shortcomings in the application of the legislation.

<<6083.58;6087.1;en>>
I hope I have answered all the questions.

<<6087.1;6087.1;en>>
I thank you for your attention, Mr. President.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<6091.68;6095.8;en>>
Thank you very much. I call Mr. Cojocariu, please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<6095.8;6102.8;en>>
Mr. President, honorable judges, I will first take the question regarding Valentin Câmpeanu's

<<6102.8;6114.88;en>>
the issue of whether he had access to proceedings, to guardianship proceedings, whether he could initiate guardianship proceedings of his own or whether he otherwise had access to justice.

<<6114.88;6127.8;en>>
Well Campano had no effective way to access justice, whether to initiate guardianship proceedings or whether to seek protection for the abuses he suffered from, for a number of reasons.

<<6127.8;6149.64;en>>
He was under the control of the social and medical authorities throughout his stay at the social, at the placement center before, while he, until he turned 18 and then at the psychiatric social care home and then at the Buenos Aires psychiatric hospital, a hospital of maximum security measures by the way.

<<6149.64;6156.88;en>>
So he was under the control of medical and social professionals, a fact which the government has accepted.

<<6156.88;6170.16;en>>
Also during the last two weeks of his life he was, he received lots of sedative medication to deal with his alleged agitated behavior.

<<6170.16;6185.56;en>>
So he could not, his capacity was already diminished due to his intellectual disability, but he also received sedatives to calm him down.

<<6185.56;6200.52;en>>
Also obviously, the most obvious reason, he received no support from the state in any way to exercise his legal capacity and be able to take decisions, to take the decision to go to court, assuming that he could do that.

<<6200.52;6220.96;en>>
The most relevant fact with respect to his agency, the most relevant fact of, during the last past two weeks of his life, has been that he hasn't been, the authorities have not involved him with respect to any decision that they took on his behalf.

<<6220.96;6233.4;en>>
So this big life-changing decisions that they took to transfer him between different institutions, to give him medication, to remove the measure of guardianship from him.

<<6233.4;6241.08;en>>
So this decision have never been communicated to him, and he was not involved at any stage in these decisions.

<<6241.08;6243.08;en>>
He was treated like an object.

<<6243.08;6245.92;en>>
So he had no agency whatsoever.

<<6245.92;6261.52;en>>
So he could not, to reply to the question, somehow he could not, he did not have the possibility to initiate guardianship proceedings, leaving aside the effectiveness of the guardianship system in Romania in general.

<<6261.52;6285.32;en>>
In fact, the government have not provided any examples of people asked by the court, the government have not provided any examples of similar situations where people in the same situation as Campiano could effectively have access to courts to complain about the regime of their detention or other human rights abuses that they suffered.

<<6285.32;6312.68;en>>
With respect to the question on the difference between our approach to the matter of victim status, we submit that the outcome, the outcome that we want to see is that and which is in compliance with the principle that rights is effective, rights under the Convention are effective in principle.

<<6312.68;6324.28;en>>
An outcome that is in compliance with the effectiveness principle is that the Court hears this case on the merits. We suggested that the best way in which we could

<<6324.28;6335.84;en>>
– in which the Court could achieve this is by extending the indirect victim status to include NGOs in the special circumstances of this case. But this issue is a novel

<<6335.84;6340.4;en>>
issue which has not been thoroughly clarified by the Court so far.

<<6340.4;6351.48;en>>
There are a number of ways in which the outcome that we mentioned, so hearing this case on the merits, can be achieved. For example, Campiano himself could be considered

<<6351.48;6367.04;en>>
an applicant in his own right, in which case the CLR could be – would be acting in the capacity of a representative on the basis of some implicit mandate resulting from all the considerations in this case. But, you know, whereas there are a number

<<6367.04;6392.76;en>>
of possibilities, to us it is not important, like really the precise modality in which the Court organizes or applies its admissibility criteria, to us the outcome is important, and the outcome is that the Court declares that the individual is admissible, and here is it on the merits. I will leave my colleague now.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<6403.75;6408.49;en>>
Mr. President, Honorable Court, one question it was about,

<<6408.49;6414.15;en>>
we did know Valentin Cumpanu before our visit to Panama Hospital.

<<6414.15;6416.49;en>>
No, we didn't.

<<6416.49;6427.49;en>>
We developed one year before, in 2003, a program aiming to advocate for the rights of the people with mental disability in Romania.

<<6427.49;6436.31;en>>
And one of our main tools in this program was to monitor different places of detention.

<<6436.31;6452.29;en>>
Two days before our visit to Puanamare was organized, we find out from the media that 80 persons died in the Puanamare Hospital because of malnourished hypothermia and things like this.

<<6452.29;6458.19;en>>
Therefore, we decided to go there on the 20th February, 2004.

<<6458.19;6462.81;en>>
Actually, the monitor was my colleague, Georgiana Pascu, present here.

<<6462.81;6464.35;en>>
She was the only one there.

<<6464.35;6471.35;en>>
And yes, the manager of the hospital was all the time with my colleague.

<<6471.35;6476.81;en>>
She joined Georgiana Pascu during all her visit in the Puanamare Hospital.

<<6476.81;6486.35;en>>
The Puanamare Hospital is a huge ward with very many buildings, with more than 500 persons there.

<<6486.35;6492.75;en>>
At the end of this huge warehouse, let's say, there was another building.

<<6492.75;6500.15;en>>
Georgiana Pascu wanted to visit this building, and especially a room that was locked.

<<6500.15;6502.11;en>>
She asked the director, what is here?

<<6502.11;6504.35;en>>
The manager of this hospital said, it's nothing.

<<6504.35;6505.89;en>>
It's just an empty room.

<<6505.89;6507.99;en>>
Please open this room.

<<6507.99;6515.55;en>>
And the director of the hospital asked somebody to bring the key because the room was closed.

<<6515.55;6524.81;en>>
And somewhere behind the door, there was one single bed with Valentin Kampanou, in the condition you have already known.

<<6524.81;6526.71;en>>
So yes, the manager was there.

<<6526.71;6532.59;en>>
Georgiana Pascu asked to do something for this young person.

<<6532.59;6540.61;en>>
He said that, one moment, please, that Valentin Kampanou was brought by the child protection and left there.

<<6540.61;6544.83;en>>
And they have no possibilities to transfer him because he is a social care.

<<6544.83;6547.99;en>>
It was not an emergency care.

<<6547.99;6551.07;en>>
This was the response.

<<6551.07;6562.79;en>>
The other question was about High Court of Cassation, why we didn't challenge this case in front of the High Court of Cassation of Justice, if I understood correctly.

<<6562.79;6570.43;en>>
The case run by the High Court of Cassation on Justice, it was not a case on merits.

<<6570.43;6576.03;en>>
We are discussing now about the other file with other person dead.

<<6576.03;6592.23;en>>
And on this file, there were different types of runnings before the Romanian courts on merits and on an objection raised by the prosecutor regarding our local standing.

<<6592.23;6602.11;en>>
Only in this case, only related to this objection raised by this prosecutor, we came along to the High Court of Cassation of Justice.

<<6602.11;6603.59;en>>
And this was the end.

<<6603.59;6615.71;en>>
At the time we challenged this present case, Valentin Kampanou, we have already had the local standing given by the High Court of Cassation of Justice.

<<6615.71;6625.31;en>>
So we have no material competence or procedural competence to go again to the High Court of Cassation of Justice.

<<6625.31;6625.31;en>>
Thank you very much for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Dean Spielmann]]

<<6627.76;6629.76;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<6629.76;6632.88;en>>
We have now come to the end of the hearing.

<<6632.88;6637.96;en>>
I thank the parties for their interventions and answers to the court's questions.

<<6637.96;6642.2;en>>
The court will now deliberate on the admissibility and merits.

<<6642.2;6651.04;en>>
The judgment will be delivered later and the parties will be informed of the date of delivery and I declare the hearing closed.

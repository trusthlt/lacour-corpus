La Cour!

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<58.06;65.06;en>>
Please be seated.

<<73.26;80.78;en>>
I declare open the public hearing on the merits in the case of Navalny versus Russia.

<<80.78;92.58;en>>
I have to inform the parties that Judge Murovik-Strom has been replaced by Judge Ilievski.

<<92.58;102.46;en>>
The five applications were lodged with the court on various dates between 14 May 2012 and 6...

<<102.46;104.34;en>>
I apologize.

<<104.34;114.54;en>>
Judge Murovik-Strom has been replaced by Judge Paczolay and Judge Ilievski becomes the third substitute.

<<114.54;116.14;en>>
My apologies.

<<116.14;134.58;en>>
The five applications were lodged with the court on various dates between 14 May 2012 and 6 June 2014 on the Article 34 of the Convention by a Russian national, Mr. Alexei Anatolievich Navalny.

<<134.58;144.24;en>>
The applications were allocated to the third section of the court pursuant to Rule 52, paragraph 1 of the rules of the court.

<<144.24;151.24;en>>
The applications were communicated to the government on 28 August 2014.

<<151.54;159.26;en>>
On 2 February 2017, a chamber of the third section delivered its judgment in the case.

<<159.26;171.94;en>>
It joined the applications and unanimously found violations of Articles 11 and 5 of the Convention and also in regard to parts of the complaints on Article 6.

<<171.94;181.62;en>>
It declared the applicants' complaints on Articles 14 and 18 admissible but held that it was not necessary to examine them.

<<181.62;204.14;en>>
On 26 April and 2 May 2017, respectively, the government and the applicant requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention and the panel of the Grand Chamber accepted their requests on 29 May 2017.

<<204.14;229.74;en>>
The respondent governments are represented by their agent, Mr. Mikhail Galperin, representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, assisted by Mrs. Yana Borisova, Mr. Pavel Smirnov, Mrs. Mariia Zinoveva, Mr. Nikolay Chestnykh, Mr. Rostislav Lesnikov, Mr. Vasiliy Oleynik and Mr. Dmitrii Gazizov, advisors.

<<229.74;237.5;en>>
The applicant is represented by Mrs. Anna Maralyan and Mrs. Olga Mikhaylova, counsels.

<<237.5;240.58;en>>
The applicant is also present.

<<240.58;245.08;en>>
I welcome the representatives in the name of the Court.

<<245.08;253.88;en>>
Having consulted the agent of the government and the representatives of the applicant, I have determined the order of addresses as follows.

<<253.88;264.3;en>>
Mrs. Maralyan for the applicant will speak first, followed by Mrs. Mikhaylova, then the applicant Mr. Navalnyy, and finally for the government Mr. Galperin.

<<264.3;283.48;en>>
I would explain that in addition to interpreting in the two official languages of the Court, English and French, interpreting into Russian has been authorized for the benefit of a group of lawyers participating in the International Law in Advocacy program attending this hearing.

<<283.48;293.24;en>>
That interpreting is not arranged by the Court and no transcription of the oral translation will be included in the official record of the proceedings.

<<293.24;295.34;en>>
I call Mrs. Maralyan. Please, you have the floor.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<299.57;300.61;en>>
Thank you.

<<300.61;304.17;en>>
Mr. President, distinguished members of the court,

<<304.17;307.57;en>>
this case raises issues of utmost importance.

<<307.57;326.17;en>>
If the restrictions of fundamental rights guaranteed by the convention, motivated by an ulterior purpose, not prescribed by the convention, are accepted, the result will cause profound damage to human rights, democracy, and rule of law in any democratic society.

<<326.17;338.57;en>>
In this case, the applicant is a prominent opposition leader whose fundamental rights, as this court has ruled on several occasions, have continuously been violated by the Russian authorities.

<<338.57;348.93;en>>
In the present applications, he complained that his rights guaranteed by Articles 5, 6, 11, and 18 of the convention were violated.

<<348.93;364.49;en>>
While finding violations of the applicant's rights under Articles 5, 6, and 11, the chamber ruled that there was no necessity to examine the alleged violations of Article 18 in conjunction with Articles 5 and 11.

<<364.49;376.51;en>>
The applicant now asks the grand chamber to affirm and expand the findings of the chamber by examining and ruling in favor of the applicant's claim under Article 18.

<<376.51;380.41;en>>
Mr. President, within the time provided to the applicant,

<<380.41;399.09;en>>
I will summarize the applicant's position presented in detail in his written submissions, that his claims of violations of his right to liberty, freedom of peaceful assembly, and fair trial were substantiated, and that the findings of the chamber are in conformity with the convention.

<<399.09;406.89;en>>
I will then address the applicant's discriminatory treatment on the ground of his official views.

<<406.89;410.25;en>>
Next, Ms. Mikhailova will present the applicant's

<<410.25;419.21;en>>
position, whether there was also a separate violation of Articles 18 read in conjunction with Articles 5 and 11.

<<419.21;422.25;en>>
Finally, Mr. Navalny will address the importance

<<422.25;435.17;en>>
of this case for the protection of human rights, the rule of law, and democracy, and the chilling effect on these values of restriction of convention rights undertaken for ulterior purposes.

<<435.17;443.69;en>>
As an initial matter, the applicant submits that his administrative arrests and detentions were unjustified and carried out under a pretext.

<<443.69;453.17;en>>
The applicant was charged with disobeying a lawful order of a police officer and breaching established procedure for the conduct of demonstrations.

<<453.17;465.73;en>>
However, video recordings submitted to the court clearly show that the applicant was targeted, surrounded by the riot police, and apprehended without any resistance.

<<465.73;471.45;en>>
He was not engaged in any breach of the established procedure for public demonstrations.

<<471.45;479.89;en>>
Rather, he participated in solo picketing, spontaneous assemblies, and walkouts.

<<479.89;491.89;en>>
Moreover, the authorities had ample opportunity, but unjustifiably failed to draw up administrative offense reports at the place of the applicant's apprehension.

<<491.89;512.21;en>>
As to the government's statement that it was not possible to draw up reports on the spot due to the risk that other protesters could obstruct the process, the applicant submits that, first, the police vehicles were in such a distance that it would hardly make it possible to obstruct the work of the police officers.

<<512.21;518.27;en>>
Further, there were enough police forces not to permit such an obstruction.

<<518.27;537.81;en>>
The applicant also brings to the court's attention that in almost all episodes where an administrative arrest was affected against the applicant, he was released from police stations either when three-hour time limit was to be expired or after the end of that time limit.

<<537.81;548.69;en>>
Hence, the applicant questions the statement of the government that he was released immediately after the necessary procedural documents were drawn up.

<<548.69;566.09;en>>
The applicant also claims that the actual circumstances of the applicant's arrest and detention are completely at odds with the stated official justifications, and he exposes these justifications as nothing more than bad faith pretext.

<<566.09;569.73;en>>
Mr. President, the arrest, pretrial detentions,

<<569.73;583.57;en>>
and administrative convictions of the applicant also infringed on his freedom of peaceful assembly, which this court has time and again declared to be an essential foundation of a democratic society.

<<583.57;598.69;en>>
The Russian Federation's endeavor to justify these infringements as supposedly prescribed by law, undertaken for legitimate aims and necessary in democratic society, is completely unsupported.

<<598.69;607.29;en>>
First, the infringements were not based on law because the offenses with which he was charged did not, in fact, take place.

<<607.29;616.45;en>>
Second, the interference was neither proportional to any legitimate aim pursued, nor necessary in a democratic society.

<<616.45;632.61;en>>
The government's assertion that interference with the applicant's freedom of assembly was necessary for the prevention of disorder or crime, and for the protection of rights and others, it is not supported by a shred of evidence.

<<632.61;650.61;en>>
It is well settled by this court that breaking up a peaceful assembly solely because of the absence of the requisite prior authorization without any legal conduct by the participants amounts to a disproportionate restriction of the freedom of peaceful assembly.

<<650.61;662.65;en>>
Thus, the applicant's treatment is part and parcel of the unfortunate pattern of hostility by the Russian authorities to the exercise of freedom of assembly in Russia.

<<662.65;679.93;en>>
This pattern is reflected in this court's numerous judgments and has been noted by many international organizations, including the UN, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, and major non-governmental organizations.

<<679.93;682.09;en>>
Mr. President, the applicant also

<<682.09;688.81;en>>
submits that he was not given a fair hearing in any of the seven sets of administrative proceedings.

<<688.81;703.53;en>>
As a preliminary matter, there is no merit to the government's position that Article VI of the government does not apply because the applicant was subjected to administrative arrests and detentions, which are not criminal under Russian law.

<<703.53;719.57;en>>
The court has conclusively held that regardless to the domestic law classifications, administrative arrests, convictions, and fines, such as those imposed on the applicant, fall under the criminal limb of Article VI.

<<719.57;727.29;en>>
Further, the applicant submits that in all sets of proceedings, the national court violated key elements of fair trial.

<<727.29;744.01;en>>
Most notably, they based their judgments exclusively on their versions of events put forward by the police without any corroboration and refused to admit the applicant's profference of additional evidence and witnesses for the defense.

<<744.01;759.41;en>>
The applicant, as we set out in detail in our written submissions, claims that his rights to personal liberty and freedom of assembly have been infringed because his political opinions are contrary to those of the ruling party.

<<759.41;766.69;en>>
This amounts to a violation of Article XIV, read in conjunction with Articles V and XI of the convention.

<<766.69;787.77;en>>
A telling illustration of the applicant's discriminatory treatment of demonstrators is that the 6th May 2012 large-scale unauthorized but pro-government demonstration in the center of Moscow was allowed to take place without any arrest, dispersal, or other interference.

<<787.77;803.85;en>>
The government's attempt to distinguish this demonstration as a cultural mass event is unsupported, and in any event, only acknowledges disparate treatment of public gatherings based on the content of their message.

<<803.85;806.61;en>>
Mr. President, now, with your permission,

<<806.61;809.81;en>>
I would like to turn the floor to Ms. Mikhailova, who

<<809.81;818.73;en>>
went through all the unfair proceedings against the applicant and did her best to restore the applicant's rights at national level.

<<818.73;818.73;en>>
Thank you.

[[Applicant;AP3]]

<<819.12;827.6;en>>
Mr. President, the applicant reiterates that his rights under Article 18 in conjunction

<<827.6;835.0;en>>
with Articles 5 and 11 of the Convention have been violated by the Russian authorities.

<<835.0;856.28;en>>
He does not share the Chamber's standpoint that its finding that the applicant's rights under Articles 5 and 11 of the Convention had been violated makes it unnecessary to consider that there also been a violation of Article 18 in conjunction with Articles 5 and 11.

<<856.28;873.12;en>>
Neither does the applicant share the standpoint of the government that Article 18 does not add any new element to other Articles of the Convention and is just of declaratory nature.

<<873.12;891.32;en>>
The applicant emphasizes that findings of violations of the rights guaranteed by the Convention cannot abate the need to establish a violation of Article 18 as this provision guarantees a separate and autonomous right.

<<891.32;896.28;en>>
Such substitution would be contrary to the essence of the Convention.

<<896.28;914.28;en>>
His understanding of Article 18 is supported by the Convention itself, preparatory works for Article 18 of the Convention, the court's case law, as well as concurring and dissenting opinions in numerous cases.

<<914.28;926.32;en>>
First, Article 18 expressly prohibits restriction of the rights and freedoms and strength in the Convention for purposes not prescribed by the Convention itself.

<<926.32;947.6;en>>
Further, the preparatory works indicate that the drafter's underlying concern was to guard against the imposition of restrictions arising from the State's desire to shield the political tendency which it represents from an opposition which it considers dangerous.

<<947.6;964.96;en>>
Indeed, according to the court's established case law, though Article 18 cannot apply alone, it can be breached even if there is no violation of the Article in conjunction with which it is applied.

<<964.96;968.4;en>>
This underlines its autonomous meaning.

<<968.4;995.72;en>>
On numerous occasions, including the present case, the justice of the court and their separate opinions expressed the view that to refrain from examining an Article 18 claim merely because the court found violations of provisions in court with Article 18 deprive the provision of reasonable and independent scope of application.

<<995.72;1002.84;en>>
Mr. President, the applicant also claims that he has demonstrated in his applications and

<<1002.84;1017.88;en>>
submissions before the Chamber and Grand Chamber that the real aim of the authorities in interfering with this liberty and freedom of assembly in each of the episodes was different from that stated.

<<1017.88;1031.52;en>>
Rather, the authorities were pursuing an ulterior motive, namely to undermine and suppress the applicant's ability to act as a leading opposition leader.

<<1031.52;1037.72;en>>
The applicant has been fighting against corruption for more than 10 years.

<<1037.72;1043.52;en>>
His blog is visited by about a million internet users per month.

<<1043.52;1060.76;en>>
He is actively engaged in Russian politics as an opposition leader and has been recognized in international media as arguably the only major opposition figure to emerge in Russia in the past years.

<<1060.76;1069.24;en>>
The man Vladimir Putin fears most, Russia's chief whistleblower and one-man WikiLeaks.

<<1069.24;1078.88;en>>
The applicant states that he was targeted and arrested, though he did not cause any nuisances or breach any law.

<<1078.88;1089.2;en>>
And there could be no legitimate reason to arrest and what's more, to keep the applicant under pretrial detention.

<<1089.2;1093.12;en>>
These violations have been extremely repetitive.

<<1093.12;1115.04;en>>
Indeed, repetitive arrests during peaceful assemblies in violation of national laws and the convention have become an administrative practice in the Russian Federation towards those who criticize the government and high-ranking officials.

<<1115.04;1132.4;en>>
The authorities have stated in their observation that the purpose of the applicant's arrest and detention was to ensure the proper and timely examination of the charges against him.

<<1132.4;1149.32;en>>
The applicant reminds the court that he spent long hours in police vans before being taken to police station, where he was additionally kept for either about three hours or kept under pretrial detention.

<<1149.32;1153.92;en>>
Hence, the authority's statement is actually implausible.

<<1153.92;1189.44;en>>
As to the statement of the government, that interference was necessary for prevention of disorder or crime and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, the applicant reiterates that he did not engage in aggressive behavior or any breach of the law, which the court requests protection of the rights of others, of prevention of disorder or crime.

<<1189.44;1198.16;en>>
As to the statement of the government, the applicant was surrounded by journalists and talked to them and others.

<<1198.16;1206.68;en>>
This by no means amounts to evidence of any of the stated legitimate aims.

<<1206.68;1215.84;en>>
Rather, it reveals the true aim of preventing the applicant from communicating his views.

<<1215.84;1225.28;en>>
As Judge Keller has noted in her partial dissent in the case of Kasparov v. Russia, legitimate

<<1225.28;1235.32;en>>
justifications could be improperly invoked as a pretext in order to conceal an ulterior motive.

<<1235.32;1260.76;en>>
The drafters of the Convention knew that state intervention in the sphere of Convention rights could potentially entail the abuse of fundamental rights and freedoms for reasons of state or in order to safeguard the ruling regime against opposition actors.

<<1260.76;1279.56;en>>
The provision was designed accordingly to allow the court to address the improper limitation of rights or in other words the illegitimate restriction of Convention rights through pseudo-legitimate means.

<<1279.56;1291.24;en>>
Hence, the applicant submits that the above stated aims were just a cover enabling the authorities to attain hidden purposes.

<<1291.24;1312.12;en>>
These hidden purposes included preventing the applicant from participating in any kind of informal meetings, workouts due to his influence as an opposition leader, as well as a fight against corruption in Russia.

<<1312.12;1328.12;en>>
The authorities also aimed to punish him for his political standpoints and for participation in anti-governmental assemblies and the desire to share his political views with others.

<<1328.12;1343.92;en>>
By taking measures against the applicant, the authorities also aimed to discourage and deter other opposition leaders and the public at large from participating in peaceful assemblies.

<<1343.92;1365.48;en>>
Even if there was any plausibility to the government's stated aims in restricting the applicant's liberty and freedom of assembly, the applicant submits that these restrictions were chiefly meant for an ulterior purpose.

<<1365.48;1370.36;en>>
This is a fundamental aspect of his case.

<<1370.36;1400.76;en>>
The Green Chamber has ruled in its most recent judgment on Article 18 of the Convention that a restriction can be compatible with a substantive Convention provision because it passes an aim permissible under that provision, but still influences Article 18 because it was chiefly meant for another purpose that is not prescribed by the Convention.

<<1400.76;1415.36;en>>
In this case, the applicant, who has been fighting against corruption in Russia for years and is actively engaged in Russian politics, has been harassed by the authorities for years.

<<1415.36;1442.68;en>>
As to the statement of the government that the applicant's allegations that they aim behind taking measures against his political activities, anti-corruption campaigns, as well as discouragement of others to participate in the country's political life, are just a point of view, a personal perception the applicant submits the following.

<<1442.68;1454.76;en>>
In the last year alone, the applicant was deprived of his liberty for so-called administrative offences for 60 days.

<<1454.76;1460.92;en>>
He was numerously arrested through all these years and even convicted.

<<1460.92;1478.68;en>>
This court has found violation of the applicant's rights in four cases, in the majority of which the court found a link between the applicant's political standpoints and the violation of his rights guaranteed by the Convention.

<<1478.68;1499.0;en>>
Furthermore, the applicant has lodged seven more applications with the court, where he claims that his rights and freedoms were violated due to his political views and the fight against corruption in Russia.

<<1499.0;1523.08;en>>
In Japan, mass media, including such as the BBC, the Wall Street Journal, Reuters, The Guardian, have numerously raised their concerns in respect of the applicant's repetitive arrest, as well as emphasises the applicant's major role in the Russian political life.

<<1523.08;1543.8;en>>
Moreover, the statements made by Russian authorities, including high-ranked officials, leave no doubt that the applicant is considered as a political danger and everything is done to limit his rights and freedoms.

<<1543.8;1565.08;en>>
The response of the President of the Russian Federation to the question concerning the right of the applicant to stand for the presidential elections of 2018 provides a vivid and revealing insight into the government's true concerns about the applicant.

<<1565.08;1594.28;en>>
The Russian President called the applicant the Russian Saakashvili, who is positioned as a very negative politician by Russian authorities, and asked, I quote, Do you want tents like Saakashvili to be running around public squares, and you want these Saakashvili to destabilise the situation in the country?

<<1594.28;1597.72;en>>
Do you want attempted coup d'etat?

<<1597.72;1601.6;en>>
We've lived through all that.

<<1601.6;1605.8;en>>
Do you really want to go back to all that?

<<1605.8;1611.56;en>>
We don't want a second edition of Ukraine for Russia.

<<1611.56;1617.64;en>>
We don't want this, and we won't allow it.

<<1617.64;1649.4;en>>
Based on the above mentioned and the arguments brought in the applicant's written submission, the applicant claims that his rights guaranteed by Article 18 read in conjunction with Articles 11 and 5 of the Convention were violated, which in its turn undermines the values of a democratic society governed by the rule of law.

<<1649.4;1673.64;en>>
As the justices on this court stated in their separate opinions, if the human rights of political active persons are restricted for the purpose of hindering or making impossible their participation in the political life of a country, democracy is a danger.

<<1673.64;1681.8;en>>
Mr President, with your permission, now I would like to give the floor to Mr Navalnyy, the applicant.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<1683.74;1686.38;en>>
Mr. Michello and Mr. Navalny for seven minutes, please.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<1690.4;1691.3;en>>
Thank you.

<<1691.3;1694.28;en>>
Mr. President, honorable members of the court,

<<1694.28;1698.96;en>>
I would like to begin by quoting my esteemed opponents.

<<1698.96;1706.12;en>>
The European Court of Human Rights did not find political persecution in the case of Navalny.

<<1706.12;1717.92;en>>
This was the triumphant hazing of press release recently issued by the Russian Ministry of Justice in connection with their loss in yet another of my cases.

<<1717.92;1727.72;en>>
The court found that my right to fair trial had been violated, that the very fact of a criminal violation was also absent.

<<1727.72;1730.68;en>>
It is a wonderful, just decision.

<<1730.68;1732.4;en>>
I'm satisfied with it.

<<1732.4;1736.28;en>>
But nevertheless, it fully satisfies my opponents.

<<1736.28;1745.8;en>>
They consider themselves victorious, so long as there is no findings under Article 18 of the convention.

<<1745.8;1747.36;en>>
This is a key issue.

<<1747.36;1753.28;en>>
I would like to direct the attention of the honorable justices.

<<1753.28;1773.36;en>>
The very fact of this court's reluctance to address Article 18 in Russian cases has become a weapon of political propaganda of the regime, which quite cynically uses this court in its effort to justify its action in violation of human rights.

<<1773.36;1785.84;en>>
In this case, we are required to submit proof of political motives for the persecution of those exercising the right to freedom of assembly.

<<1785.84;1790.08;en>>
My colleagues have offered brilliant legal arguments.

<<1790.08;1799.2;en>>
If I may be permitted, I would like to offer an argument that is not legal, but rather mathematical.

<<1799.2;1806.48;en>>
Let's suppose that there is no political motives in my cases, that they are not managed from the Kremlin.

<<1806.48;1809.4;en>>
It's just a flaw of the judicial system.

<<1809.4;1821.88;en>>
But tell me, please, what is the probability that the Russian judicial system always breaks down precisely when it considers the cases of a particular individual?

<<1821.88;1831.0;en>>
Indeed, here in the European Court, there is already a sufficient number of cases directly demonstrating this.

<<1831.0;1836.16;en>>
We have won all the cases that have reached this court's review.

<<1836.16;1844.82;en>>
At minimum, the court always finds violation of Article 6 and 5 in each case involving my detention and arrests.

<<1844.82;1848.72;en>>
The same is true for any participant in rallies organized by me.

<<1848.72;1854.76;en>>
Over the past several years, I have been in prison not fewer than seven times.

<<1854.76;1860.76;en>>
Last year, when I was campaigning for the presidents, I spent two months in prison cell.

<<1860.76;1874.06;en>>
Each time when I announced a protest rally, the authorities first unlawfully prohibited and then arrested me and my colleagues for exercising our right to freedom of assembly.

<<1874.06;1878.64;en>>
To reiterate, these are not my assumptions.

<<1878.64;1885.96;en>>
They are directly affirmed by the judgments of the European Court that have entered into force.

<<1885.96;1909.6;en>>
Hence, the probability that all this can be without political coordination and political motives is as low as the probability of meeting a dinosaur by the building of the court, or the probability of Vladimir Putin losing the election for the president of Russia, a probability even lower than the dinosaur scenario.

<<1909.6;1928.32;en>>
Honorable Court, we are dealing with a cynical, well-thought out, prolonged practice of the Russian authorities of excluding the entire group of population and their representative from any form of political activity.

<<1928.32;1935.08;en>>
The right to assembly is viewed by the authorities as especially prohibited for the opposition.

<<1935.08;1935.84;en>>
Why?

<<1935.84;1944.04;en>>
Because it is the last resort to expressing dissent while all other avenues have been barred.

<<1944.04;1946.1;en>>
We are barred from mass media.

<<1946.1;1948.2;en>>
We are barred from election.

<<1948.2;1951.16;en>>
We cannot obtain just ruling in the courts.

<<1951.16;1954.6;en>>
Our NGOs are being liquidated.

<<1954.6;1958.6;en>>
Our political parties are denied registration.

<<1958.6;1967.2;en>>
I would like, once again, point out that my words are not political position, but a legal fact established by this court.

<<1967.2;1981.0;en>>
After all, I stand here as a candidate for president of Russia who was barred from participation in this election on the grounds of a fabricated criminal case that has been reviewed by this court.

<<1981.0;1985.84;en>>
The court ruled that the criminal verdict must be overturned.

<<1985.84;1997.84;en>>
Thereafter, the committee of ministers found that the Russian government has failed to implement the judgment and even expressly called upon the Russian government to allow me access to the election.

<<1997.84;2000.4;en>>
Nonetheless, that has not happened.

<<2000.4;2013.4;en>>
My supporters and I, again, excluded from the political process merely because Vladimir Putin fears that it would be more difficult for him to win the election with real competition.

<<2013.4;2020.76;en>>
What can be better proof of the political motives behind cases fabricated against me?

<<2020.76;2032.36;en>>
Honorable court, I understand that it's in the nature of any good judge to steer away from political elements of the cases and to focus on the legal aspects.

<<2032.36;2045.0;en>>
However, the drafters of the convention included Article 18 in the order that we will not forget that violation of human rights can stem from political motives.

<<2045.0;2059.42;en>>
The danger to democracy arises most often when a group of politicians crave power so strongly that respect for the law becomes optional and human rights an empty declaration.

<<2059.42;2076.92;en>>
That is precisely why I call upon the court to undertake this unpleasant task, to consider not only the right to freedom of assembly, but also political context surrounding these five cases, to trace the parallels and see what is self-evident.

<<2076.92;2088.56;en>>
The Russian authorities believe that my colleagues and I, people of certain political views, are specifically not covered by the convention of human rights.

<<2088.56;2107.78;en>>
I ask the court to give a clear and unambiguous answer to all those who see disorder in the room, talk about it, but try their best to ignore a great elephant which is crushing everything and is the reason for that disorder.

<<2107.78;2121.0;en>>
I would like the court to say, do not expect that in pursuit of judicial procedure and precise formulation, we will lose the sight of the overall picture.

<<2121.0;2130.08;en>>
The desire for uncontrolled power and intolerance of any criticism became the reason of what is going on in my country.

<<2130.08;2137.48;en>>
This is precisely to describe the phenomenon that the phrase political motives has been constructed.

<<2137.48;2141.24;en>>
Mr. President, based on the written and oral submission,

<<2141.24;2152.56;en>>
we ask this court to affirm the violation of Articles 5, 6, and 11 as well as invite the Court to find violation of Article 18 of the Convention.

<<2152.56;2153.68;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<2154.0;2157.88;en>>
Mr. Navalnyy. Now I call Mr. Galperin, please, you have the floor.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<2159.43;2161.71;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President of the Court,

<<2161.71;2165.95;en>>
Honorable Judges, Applicant and Applicant's Counsels, distinguished colleagues.

<<2165.95;2175.75;en>>
Firstly, I would like to say that it is very unwise to suspect that Russian government is somehow benefit and always won in this court.

<<2175.75;2185.57;en>>
And I think that is really the applicant, as he said just several minutes ago, just won in this court on all cases that he submitted to it.

<<2185.57;2195.35;en>>
But I appear for the government today with respect to his submission that no violation of European Convention on Human Rights occurred in this case.

<<2195.35;2203.05;en>>
Turning first to the applicant's complaints under Article 11, he has made some tendentious statements before this court.

<<2203.05;2213.65;en>>
And it is important, however, to begin with today with a legal assessment by identifying at fundamental points of common grounds between the government and applicant.

<<2213.65;2224.33;en>>
Firstly, in paragraph 110 of his observation to the Grand Chamber, he accepted that the law requiring prior notification in Russia is essential.

<<2224.33;2230.05;en>>
And it was also good to hear today from Mrs. Mikhailova just several minutes ago

<<2230.05;2238.05;en>>
that she acknowledged clearly that applicants' actions were against national law.

<<2238.05;2245.97;en>>
The state has a duty to ensure the public security and that demonstrations on the streets take place safely and peacefully.

<<2245.97;2253.31;en>>
It is citizens going about their ordinary business are entitled to be protected by the state in each episode.

<<2253.31;2258.77;en>>
The demonstrators themselves need to be protected by stopping and diverting traffic.

<<2258.77;2262.01;en>>
There must be a police presence to preserve order.

<<2262.01;2269.05;en>>
There must be a medical contingent to time and the right places to deal with any injuries which could happen.

<<2269.05;2278.29;en>>
To achieve all of these, demonstration must be held in a reasonable hour, in a reasonable place, and must be prior notification to the authorities made.

<<2278.29;2302.13;en>>
In Russia, as well as Italy, Germany, Greece, Ukraine, Albania, France, Czech Republic, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Armenia, Finland, the UK, the Netherlands, and Georgia, the parliaments have decided legitimately and democratically that prior notice is needed to protect public order and safety.

<<2302.13;2315.69;en>>
And in 13 states, the failure to give a prior notification of an assembly or to comply with that restriction imposed could be a sufficient ground in itself for dispersing an assembly.

<<2315.69;2322.61;en>>
However, this court and its decisions have sometimes protected a right to continue a non-agreed demonstration.

<<2322.61;2331.97;en>>
The present case helps us to understand the necessity of notification and liability for a failure to notify.

<<2331.97;2351.65;en>>
When, without any warning, the applicant walks down a central street in peak hour with 150 people, and it's inevitable that they will spill onto roads with traffic if the traffic hasn't been stopped there, it is obvious that bystanders can be shunted into the road.

<<2351.65;2361.21;en>>
When applicant disrupts people's evening in Moscow, in the very center of Moscow, without any warning, it is obvious that trouble may result.

<<2361.21;2369.89;en>>
When he organizes journalists to attend, making a way in front of him with cameras, the potential for accidents is clear.

<<2369.89;2376.17;en>>
Please let me just in two minutes then repeat and go through the episodes concerning this case.

<<2376.17;2385.65;en>>
On 5th of March, 2012, the applicant took part in a meeting in Pushkinskaya Square, which began at 7 o'clock, and it was agreed with the municipal authorities.

<<2385.65;2394.17;en>>
At the end of the meeting, at 9 PM, the participants decided not to disperse and to proceed with their legal gathering.

<<2394.17;2406.05;en>>
This gathering was attended by 500 people in the very center of Moscow, and standing in the front end, chanting slogans and disobeying lawful orders of the police.

<<2406.05;2416.57;en>>
Due to these events, on that day in Moscow, authorities had to divert six ordinary roads of public transport, which resulted in prolonged delays.

<<2416.57;2427.49;en>>
At 4 o'clock AM on 8th of May, 2012, the applicant marched down the Lubyansky Proyest, accompanied by around 170 people.

<<2427.49;2436.93;en>>
Given the fact that this meeting was a regular, the applicant was arrested, taken to a police station for drawing up a report, and released soon after that.

<<2436.93;2452.73;en>>
On the same day, just only one hour after being released, he once again participated in a regular meeting on Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street with 50 people there, and was taken also to police station, and another report was drawn up.

<<2452.73;2463.01;en>>
On 9th of May, 2012, at 5 o'clock in the morning, at Kudrinskaya Square, he took part in a regular meeting with a group of up to 100 people.

<<2463.01;2466.83;en>>
After one hour, police arrived and arrested the applicant.

<<2466.83;2476.01;en>>
27th of October, 2012, as alleged by the applicant, he held a static demonstration in front of the investigation committee.

<<2476.01;2488.63;en>>
However, he had clearly organized more people to attend there, and this group of people intentionally participated in the event on the same place, with the same slogans, and on the same time.

<<2488.63;2495.43;en>>
Their collective purpose was in fact acknowledged by the Chamber of the Court in the paragraph 46 of his judgment.

<<2495.43;2507.11;en>>
And finally, on 24th of February, 2014, at noon, the applicant went to a regular gathering in direct violation of the rules against mass gatherings near the court buildings.

<<2507.11;2517.37;en>>
The applicant and his supporters blocked traffic on the very narrow street in the center of Moscow, and were peacefully invited by the police several times to free the area.

<<2517.37;2523.67;en>>
However, the applicant has ignored this invitation, proceeded with his illegal intention.

<<2523.67;2528.73;en>>
Later, the same day, repeatedly, about 7.45 p.m. in the evening,

<<2528.73;2535.09;en>>
the applicant took part in another regular gathering at Tverskaya Street, which is the busiest street in Moscow.

<<2535.09;2546.25;en>>
There was a gathering of about 150 participants, and when the applicant was seated in the police vehicle, he was waving at the crowd, trying to provoke unrest.

<<2546.25;2551.33;en>>
Later, he was also taken to police station for drawing up the report.

<<2551.33;2568.05;en>>
So the applicant understands that the law of prenotification is essential, and yet, he repeatedly and deliberately ignores national law and breaches it by failing to notify his protects to the authorities and failing to approve arrangements to ensure public order and safety.

<<2568.05;2569.93;en>>
Why he does that?

<<2569.93;2580.97;en>>
Let's turn to the evidence provided by the applicant himself, which were the selective video of his apprehension, and that the applicant relies upon to portray himself as the victim.

<<2580.97;2583.33;en>>
The video is carefully constructed.

<<2583.33;2586.33;en>>
Generally, it doesn't show the full lead up to the arrest.

<<2586.33;2595.85;en>>
Usually, the operator of the cameras stands away from the main area and just look at the police bus.

<<2595.85;2607.13;en>>
Quite clearly, the applicant's objective has been to breach the law deliberately, and we see there just the moment of arrest, but not the lead up to that.

<<2607.13;2614.89;en>>
However, on the same video, it is seen that policemen acted legitimately and gave clear direction each time before any actions.

<<2614.89;2623.25;en>>
For example, during the meeting of 24th of February, 2014, the police clearly warned the participants not to block the route.

<<2623.25;2633.11;en>>
At the event of 27th of October, 2012, the police clearly warned participants in non-agreed gatherings that their conduct would be considered a breach of the law.

<<2633.11;2639.03;en>>
During the event of 5th of March, 2012, police warned demonstrators to clear the route.

<<2639.03;2646.61;en>>
Compare recent events in Barcelona, for example, or in Kiev, where police acted roughly in the events of provocation.

<<2646.61;2651.37;en>>
By contrast, Russian police repeatedly show very considerable restraint.

<<2651.37;2664.85;en>>
For example, during the meeting on 24th of February, the police didn't disperse people immediately, even though the location was close to a court building where national law, as I said, clearly prohibits the holding of public gatherings.

<<2664.85;2673.21;en>>
On 5th of March, 2012, the applicant was apprehended almost two hours after initiating of a non-agreed meeting.

<<2673.21;2680.13;en>>
On 8th of May, 2012, the police waited for quite a long time before dispersing demonstrators.

<<2680.13;2684.01;en>>
Law enforcement was not severe or disproportionate.

<<2684.01;2696.01;en>>
The police never used tear gas, batons, water cannons, dogs, rubber bullets, or any kind of weapon in any of the episodes under consideration today.

<<2696.01;2704.13;en>>
The video material shows that Russian police repeatedly acted with moderation despite being provoked by the applicant's supporters.

<<2704.13;2709.37;en>>
The applicant does not, of course, acknowledge the motivation to present himself as a victim.

<<2709.37;2720.09;en>>
The most he does is try to diminish his offenses by describing the marches and demonstrators that he organizes without prior notification as a walkabout, which was also mentioned today.

<<2720.09;2730.21;en>>
I respectfully draw the court's attention, for example, the applicant's handwritten explanations in the police protocols and his oral submissions in the national court hearing.

<<2730.21;2740.49;en>>
On these occasions, applicant insisted that he did not participate in any public event, did not shout slogans, did not breach the law in public gatherings.

<<2740.49;2744.33;en>>
There is clear contradiction on the applicant's position himself.

<<2744.33;2753.17;en>>
If the events in question really were walkabouts and do not demonstrations, then according to the ruling in Anderson v. UK case, for example,

<<2753.17;2756.13;en>>
the Article 11 is not applicable at all.

<<2756.13;2769.17;en>>
And I quote the case, there is, however, no indication that freedom of assembly is intended to guarantee a right to pass and repass in public places or to assemble for purely social purposes anywhere one wishes.

<<2769.17;2774.61;en>>
Neither would Article 14 or 18 have any relevance here.

<<2774.61;2785.61;en>>
However, if the events would indeed be qualified as assemblies, then Russian authorities acted legitimately under the Russian legislation by subjecting the applicant to administrative liability.

<<2785.61;2796.41;en>>
The reality is that the applicant's so-called walkabouts really are marches and demonstrations that require notification, proper organization, and policy.

<<2796.41;2804.21;en>>
None of this meeting concerned was spontaneous, as applicant alleged, or has the form of immediate demonstration.

<<2804.21;2816.73;en>>
Large number of people do not gather spontaneously at 4 AM in the morning or after 10 PM at night, with representatives of mass media also forewarned and present there.

<<2816.73;2825.29;en>>
The applicant has never clearly answered basic question, that basic question about legal qualification of the relevant events planned by him.

<<2825.29;2835.65;en>>
But we get some clues in his written submission to this court where the applicant himself sees events in question as assemblies and call himself as demonstrator.

<<2835.65;2839.49;en>>
The applicant and his supporters are not above the law.

<<2839.49;2848.73;en>>
They have no right to organize marches and demonstrations without complying with the Russian law and protecting public order and safety.

<<2848.73;2855.41;en>>
On the contrary, other citizens also have the right under that law to public order and safety.

<<2855.41;2860.09;en>>
That law applies to the applicant just like everyone else.

<<2860.09;2874.13;en>>
From all I have described, it follows that enforcement of Russian national law in the instances under examination was in each case fair and proportionate, and law enforcement procedure fell within the margin of appreciation of Russian authorities.

<<2874.13;2880.93;en>>
It would be impossible to say that they acted without justification or in any way unreasonable.

<<2880.93;2892.85;en>>
Members of the ground chamber, the applicant further alleges that his arrest on seven occasions was unlawful, and then on two occasions he was unjustifiably detained pending administrative proceedings.

<<2892.85;2896.93;en>>
However, his complaints have no merit.

<<2896.93;2908.91;en>>
Consistently with Article 5, it was appropriate to arrest the applicant to terminate his illegal conduct, namely his leading of demonstrations and marches in breach of the law.

<<2908.91;2916.03;en>>
Doing otherwise would allow and even amplify the risks that the law was designed to prevent.

<<2916.03;2923.25;en>>
The applicant's short detention was also appropriate in order to take him before authorities to deal with his offenses.

<<2923.25;2935.89;en>>
As regard the applicant's complaints, the charge sheets were not filled out in the support the moment consideration of the circumstances show that these would not have been practicable and that the police applied the law as best they could.

<<2935.89;2949.01;en>>
For example, let me respectfully point your attention, for example, to the events of 26th of March last year when supporters of the applicant basically shook the police bus with the applicant inside trying to pull him out.

<<2949.01;2954.65;en>>
So would it be possible to write the report when you are surrounded by the violent crowd?

<<2954.65;2961.61;en>>
The police had every reason to believe the demonstrations in case under consideration could act aggressively.

<<2961.61;2968.73;en>>
For example, during the meeting on 5th of March 2012, some of the demonstrators punched hoods of cars.

<<2968.73;2975.05;en>>
The applicant wrote the following in his Twitter account on this day when he was arrested.

<<2975.05;2977.53;en>>
Our vehicle's number is 2012.

<<2977.53;2981.69;en>>
Attention, do not ban it, just puncture tires.

<<2981.69;2994.41;en>>
Just a few days before the meeting on 8th and 9th May 2012, there had been a large and very violent crashes and mass disorder during the famous Bolotnaya Square incident.

<<2994.41;3004.69;en>>
I would like to ask, did the police act under the standard of reasonableness when it removed the vehicle from violent crowd before filing out of the reports?

<<3004.69;3010.07;en>>
Or would the police in other member states of the Council of Europe behave in the same way?

<<3010.07;3015.85;en>>
The answer to both questions is clearly yes, as it was the police duty to prevent crashes.

<<3015.85;3022.89;en>>
Moreover, it is sensible to remove the activists of a non-agreed demonstration to eliminate tension in the crowd.

<<3022.89;3030.41;en>>
The applicant points out that this court expects flexibility in the application of public order laws when it comes to arrest.

<<3030.41;3049.53;en>>
But regarding public order and safety where arrests are necessary, flexibility, and very careful case by case, episode by episode analysis are also appropriate, as it was demonstrated by the chamber of the court when examining the violation of Article 6 and dismissing some of the applicant's claims.

<<3049.53;3053.33;en>>
It is also true with regard to Article 11.

<<3053.33;3064.05;en>>
It is natural that public order laws should carry penalties for breach, which adds to the importance of certainty, clarity, and consistency in their applications.

<<3064.05;3074.45;en>>
For all of these reasons, the court should not approve a tactic on the part of the applicant of deliberate failure to preemptify matches and demonstrations under the law.

<<3074.45;3091.21;en>>
On the contrary, I respectfully suggest that this court should make clear that if any group decides repeatedly to ignore national laws and public safety for political advantage, it should not expect indulgence or encouragement from this court.

<<3091.21;3103.97;en>>
The applicant claims that Article 6 was violated by refusal of the national court to quote certain evidences, including testimony of police officers, that apprehended him and instead accepting their written reports.

<<3103.97;3108.53;en>>
In this regard, I submit that this allegation also is ill-founded.

<<3108.53;3118.41;en>>
The court has sometimes criticized Russian courts for applying a presumption of good faith in relation to police officers and their written evidence.

<<3118.41;3124.97;en>>
However, such presumption is normal and necessary for the effective functioning of the justice system.

<<3124.97;3132.37;en>>
For the police, it is normal to produce a written report in relation to each incident.

<<3132.37;3135.89;en>>
For police officers, such actions are an everyday job.

<<3135.89;3148.17;en>>
On the contrary, some warning them away from law enforcement every time could paralyze the police service, and who, meanwhile, would do their job when they are going to the court each time by themselves.

<<3148.17;3155.77;en>>
It is up to the court to decide what evidences are sufficient to resolve the case in line with applicable legal standards.

<<3155.77;3161.61;en>>
I would also note that this court has declined to receive video and photos from the Russian government in the present case.

<<3161.61;3167.73;en>>
And on the contrary, it decides what evidences it regards as necessary in the case.

<<3167.73;3172.41;en>>
And the same credit should be given to the national courts to decide.

<<3172.41;3176.09;en>>
In this case, there was sensible and conventional law enforcement.

<<3176.09;3182.41;en>>
All of this means that Russian courts acted lawfully and reasonably in dealing with the applicants' trials.

<<3182.41;3189.13;en>>
All of this also means that the applicants' basis of complaints on conventional grounds is non-existent.

<<3189.13;3197.21;en>>
That perhaps explains why he attempts in new arguments under Article 18 and Article 14.

<<3197.21;3204.93;en>>
The applicant says that the authorities were motivated in applying the public order laws by legitimate motives of political oppression.

<<3204.93;3208.17;en>>
This is a hopeless argument for several reasons.

<<3208.17;3224.77;en>>
First, it doesn't follow from any single document submitted by the applicant that complaints of improper ulterior motives of discrimination were separately and distinctly formulated by him in any domestic proceedings and proceedings before the chamber of this court.

<<3224.77;3233.29;en>>
The fact that the point was not taken earlier and only in the application to the grand chamber, then, has been a failure to exhaust domestic remedies.

<<3233.29;3235.33;en>>
And the point can be taken now.

<<3235.33;3238.97;en>>
And relevant applications should be considered inadmissible.

<<3238.97;3256.93;en>>
If the court, however, decides that the complaints is admissible, I would like, following the court's invitation to make additional observation in light of Mirabishvili versus Georgia case, which, as I understand today, was ignored by the applicant's side, refer to the conclusion reached there by the grand chamber.

<<3256.93;3271.93;en>>
First, separate examination of a complaint under Article 18 is only warranted if the claim that a restriction has been applied for a purpose not prescribed by the convention appears to be a fundamental aspect of the case.

<<3271.93;3280.49;en>>
Secondly, Article 18 is only engaged where the actuating and predominant purpose behind a restriction was an illegitimate one.

<<3280.49;3287.33;en>>
If the predominant purpose was legitimate, an illegitimate subsidiary purpose is immaterial.

<<3287.33;3296.63;en>>
Regarding the first principle in Mirabishvili case, I respectfully submit that separate examination of the complaint is not needed in the present case.

<<3296.63;3303.57;en>>
Firstly, the applicant himself doesn't see complaints under Article 18 as a fundamental aspect of the case.

<<3303.57;3315.49;en>>
As said above, he paid no or very little attention to this alleged aspect of the case in his initial complaints and observation before the chamber, as well as in any domestic proceedings.

<<3315.49;3320.69;en>>
Secondly, he provides no evidence specifically relevant to Article 18.

<<3320.69;3337.21;en>>
The chamber, in its judgment, also considered the examination on this complaint unnecessary because all of the material evidence has been considered as part of examination of the applicant's allegation under so-called substantive articles, namely 5, 6, and 11.

<<3337.21;3350.05;en>>
Thirdly, the chamber approach in this regard followed the court's practice, according to which arrest for participation in a regular demonstration doesn't trigger separate examination of the complaints on Article 18.

<<3350.05;3367.25;en>>
The court has already examined six cases concerning similar complaints of Russian opposition members, for example, Nemtsov, Yashin, and Kasparov, whose level of recognition is comparable to the applicant or even higher, and complaints on Article 14 of Armenian opposition.

<<3367.25;3373.53;en>>
In none of these cases did the court regard it necessary to examine Article 18 or Article 14.

<<3373.53;3382.29;en>>
Fourthly, measures applied to the applicant are in no way comparable to those in cases where the court found the Article 18.

<<3382.29;3392.05;en>>
Timoshenko has been sentenced to seven years of real imprisonment, Mamadov to seven years, Jafarov to six and 1 and 1 2 years, and Mirabishvili to five years.

<<3392.05;3400.69;en>>
The applicant's arrest within the period concerned today lasted only once for seven and other time for 15 days only.

<<3400.69;3405.23;en>>
In all other episodes, he was sentenced to non-substantive fines.

<<3405.23;3409.73;en>>
The applicant was not physically excluded from political and social life.

<<3409.73;3420.05;en>>
On the contrary, during the period under examination, which is years 2012 to 2014, he enjoyed all opportunities to actively participate in it.

<<3420.05;3425.87;en>>
For example, in 2013, he participated in a mayor election in Moscow as a candidate.

<<3425.87;3427.73;en>>
He continued to write his blog.

<<3427.73;3439.21;en>>
He really started his YouTube channel in that times and was in no way deprived of the freedom of movement, not then and not now, which respective judges can see by their own eyes today.

<<3439.21;3445.29;en>>
Therefore, the complaint under Article 18 doesn't constitute the fundamental aspect of the case.

<<3445.29;3449.45;en>>
Thus, no further investigation to Article 18 is needed.

<<3449.45;3467.73;en>>
If the court nevertheless decide to proceed with that, there can be no doubt regarding the second principle in Mirabishvili case that no political background is involved and that the sole and actuating purpose of the authorities in applying this national law was protecting public order and safety.

<<3467.73;3470.47;en>>
That is apparent from the following facts.

<<3470.47;3482.65;en>>
First, in four out of seven cases considered, the applicant participated in gathering which occurred outside the time limits prescribed by the law directly, which is from 10 PM to 7 AM.

<<3482.65;3489.41;en>>
The applicant was an advocate, obtained a law degree, and alleged himself publicly to drive his own law practice.

<<3489.41;3496.17;en>>
Even if he was not a lawyer, his repeated personal experience of these laws must have made him an expert in them.

<<3496.17;3509.69;en>>
Therefore, the applicant couldn't be unaware of the prescribed time limit and deliberately breached the law in two episodes, as I said, repeatedly in the same day after release from police.

<<3509.69;3515.39;en>>
Second, the applicant continues now the practice of systematic and intentional provocations.

<<3515.39;3530.21;en>>
For example, before the public gatherings on 26th of March, 2017, according to his website, the applicant tried to convince members of the public to behave in such a way that the police would have to arrest them for a breach of national law.

<<3530.21;3546.13;en>>
According to the applicant's blog, namely to the note published on 22nd of March, 2017, he also promised large sum of money to be received from this court to people who would follow his guidance to participate in non-agreed manifestation.

<<3546.13;3554.53;en>>
Moreover, the blog makes clear that most of the applicant's income derives from his action as a lawyer specializing in the practice of European court.

<<3554.53;3562.05;en>>
By inspiring people to participate in non-agreed gatherings, the applicant serves his own political and personal gain.

<<3562.05;3568.41;en>>
Third, statistics show that authorities followed no other aim except stopping breaches of the law.

<<3568.41;3585.05;en>>
From 2010 to 2015, the percentage of the authorized meetings in support of applicant in Moscow was 78%, which is quite similar to the general percentage of the authorization granted by the powers.

<<3585.05;3591.89;en>>
The authorities do not restrict the applicant and his supporters and their desire to publicly press their political views.

<<3591.89;3603.05;en>>
For example, around 250 public events in support of applicant were authorized in the period of only 40 days in autumn last year throughout Russia.

<<3603.05;3609.17;en>>
The applicant himself participated only in 26 public events from these.

<<3609.17;3613.73;en>>
And for the same period, including five which were not agreed still.

<<3613.73;3622.21;en>>
For example, on 8th of December 2017, eight meetings in different cities were agreed with the authorities in his support.

<<3622.21;3629.13;en>>
However, he chose to participate in non-agreed event on the same day on another city.

<<3629.13;3632.93;en>>
The applicant was never detained during authorized gatherings.

<<3632.93;3640.15;en>>
For the period under consideration, he took part in pre-notified events without any interference and arrest.

<<3640.15;3661.25;en>>
On 24th of December 2011, on 4th of February 2012, on 25th of February 2012, and on 9th of September 2013, the applicant was never the only person detained during the events under consideration, which we will see also in the video provided by the applicant.

<<3661.25;3666.53;en>>
Contrary to his allegation, he was never targeted or discriminated.

<<3666.53;3673.65;en>>
Thus, the applicant deliberately chose to organize and participate in irregular, non-authorized gatherings.

<<3673.65;3681.09;en>>
It is clear that the reason for it is the interest of arrests on his popularity and level of recognition.

<<3681.09;3692.13;en>>
According to the statistics of the independent Levada Center, recognition has increased for 10% after the applicant participated in non-agreed gatherings in 2012.

<<3692.13;3700.41;en>>
Thus, knowing that the administrative fraction would favor his popularity, the applicant consciously breached national law on public gatherings.

<<3700.41;3714.01;en>>
Honorable judges, I would like to reiterate that the underlying incentive behind the actions of the police was the need to follow procedure prescribed by law that falls into margin of appreciation of a Russian Federation.

<<3714.01;3719.05;en>>
The law was enforced against the applicant exactly in the same way as against other people.

<<3719.05;3722.41;en>>
He suffered no discrimination for his political opinion.

<<3722.41;3732.21;en>>
As the court stated in Khodorkovsky versus Russia case, a large political status of a person cannot grant immunity for violations of law.

<<3732.21;3739.69;en>>
Experts hope that the court will provide encouragement for the applicant to continue his practice of provocations.

<<3739.69;3748.69;en>>
While the applicant may gain politically by presenting himself as a victim of political oppression, other people would certainly suffer from that.

<<3748.69;3756.93;en>>
The applicant has already announced that mass demonstrations would be held across Russia on 28th of January this year, which is this Saturday.

<<3756.93;3764.13;en>>
According to his own words in the blog, 90% of the gatherings were agreed with the authorities.

<<3764.13;3769.37;en>>
Nevertheless, he again called people to participate in non-agreed mass manifestations.

<<3769.37;3782.89;en>>
For example, he states that despite the meeting wasn't agreed, people should still demonstrate or invite people to ignore authorities' propositions and in any way go and demonstrate in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

<<3782.89;3790.09;en>>
All circumstances of the case show that the applicant wants national law to be enforced against him and his supporters.

<<3790.09;3798.19;en>>
He clearly wants to be arrested, while Russian authorities persuade no other purpose except for the legitimate one.

<<3798.19;3806.75;en>>
Given that the applicant's object was apparently to be arrested, there is some irony in his complaints about the limitation of his freedom.

<<3806.75;3815.49;en>>
Honorable judges, the government respectfully submit that firstly, there have been no violation of Article 5, 6, or 11.

<<3815.49;3824.33;en>>
Secondly, the complaint under Article 18, taken in conjunction with Article 11 or Article 5, doesn't trigger separate examination.

<<3824.33;3832.69;en>>
Finally, that there have been no violation of Article 14 or Article 18 of the convention in this case.

<<3832.69;3834.09;en>>
And this concludes my submission.

<<3834.09;3834.09;en>>
Thank you very much for your attention.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<3835.97;3842.85;en>>
Thank you very much Mr. Galperin and I thank both parties for their submissions.

<<3843.45;3852.45;en>>
And now I invite my colleagues, the judges of the Grand Chamber wishing to do so, to put their questions to the parties.

<<3852.45;3852.45;en>>
Once I see Judge Nußberger please.

[[Judge;Angelika Nußberger]]

<<3856.58;3857.58;en>>
Thank you, President.

<<3857.58;3861.1;en>>
I would have two questions to the Russian government.

<<3861.1;3872.3;en>>
First, I would like to understand the decision-making process when the riot police intervenes and disperses demonstrations.

<<3872.3;3877.22;en>>
I guess there is some general strategy how to act.

<<3877.22;3879.94;en>>
Who elaborates this strategy?

<<3879.94;3882.62;en>>
On which level is it done?

<<3882.62;3891.34;en>>
And then, when the police officers of the OMON, of the riot police, intervene, do they do it spontaneously?

<<3891.34;3898.76;en>>
Do they ask the headquarter who takes the respective orders?

<<3898.76;3900.1;en>>
That would be my first question.

<<3900.1;3904.48;en>>
And my second question is for interpretation of Russian law.

<<3904.48;3915.26;en>>
I understand that in every modern society it's sometimes necessary to queue up somewhere before an entrance of a theater or shop, wherever.

<<3915.26;3918.38;en>>
It was a court building, you queue up.

<<3918.38;3926.18;en>>
And how do you then differentiate between queuing up – there might be many people – and between what you consider an assembly?

<<3926.18;3926.18;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<3927.2;3928.8;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<3928.8;3929.8;en>>
Judge Spano, please.

[[Judge;Robert Spano]]

<<3931.45;3933.79;en>>
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

<<3933.79;3940.59;en>>
I have one question that I would like to pose to the applicant.

<<3940.59;3955.07;en>>
As you're aware, one of the questions posed for the hearing and one of the issues the Grand Chamber is considering is the issue under Article 18.

<<3955.07;3965.59;en>>
We have now a recent Grand Chamber judgment in a case called Metabishvili versus Georgia, where the court consolidates its case law on this issue.

<<3965.59;3978.87;en>>
And one of the issues mentioned here today is the finding by the court that under Article 18, the so-called predominant purpose has to be or appeared to be the fundamental aspect of the case.

<<3978.87;3979.95;en>>
So it is on that basis.

<<3979.95;4011.51;en>>
And because there is an argument made by the government which hasn't been addressed here today or in your written pleadings, the government says in their observations, and I refer here to the observations of the 18th of December lodged with the court, in paragraph 13, the government says, in particular, Article 18 of the convention was expressly invoked by the applicant in only two out of his five applications.

<<4011.51;4016.19;en>>
And those two applications relate to the first two episodes.

<<4016.19;4025.51;en>>
Article 18 was not expressed, according to the government, was not expressly invoked by the applicant for the five last episodes.

<<4025.51;4032.71;en>>
And the reference to political reasons or persecutions is not to be found in the initial application.

<<4032.71;4037.37;en>>
Mr. Navalnyy said here today Article 18 is the key issue in the case.

<<4037.37;4053.49;en>>
Could I then ask the applicant to elaborate, why is in Article 18, why didn't it form part of the initial pleadings by the applicant and an argumentation made already at the state of original applications within the court?

<<4053.49;4057.27;en>>
And how would you answer the government's contention on this issue?

<<4057.27;4060.91;en>>
Because, after all, that's one of the elements that we need to consider.

<<4060.91;4060.91;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4061.67;4063.57;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4063.57;4064.57;en>>
Giorgio Ravarani, please.

[[Judge;Georges Ravarani]]

<<4066.05;4067.41;fr>>
Merci, M. le Président.

<<4067.41;4069.73;fr>>
J'ai une question au gouvernement.

<<4069.73;4087.61;fr>>
Est-ce qu'en Russie, d'une manière générale, je me permets d'insister sur la notion de généralité et non sur le cas individuel dont la Corée saisit, les autorités font preuve de sévérité à l'égard de tous les manifestants dès lors qu'elles considèrent qu'une manifestation est illégale?

<<4087.61;4087.61;fr>>
Merci.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<4088.69;4091.89;en>>
Merci beaucoup. Now Judge Eicke please.

[[Judge;Tim Eicke]]

<<4095.7;4101.7;en>>
Thank you M. president. I have three blocks of questions. The first addresses the question of admissibility.

<<4101.7;4115.7;en>>
The first two elements of that go to the applicant. The government in paragraphs 11 to 15 of its observation to the Grand Chamber raises an objection of admissibility of the Article 5 complaint in relation to six out of the seven arrests complained of.

<<4115.7;4130.7;en>>
How does the applicant respond to that objection, which might of course go to the court's jurisdiction to consider these complaints, and how, if at all, do you say the court should deal with that objection now?

<<4130.7;4148.7;en>>
The same question arises in relation to Article 11, where the government in paragraphs 32 and 33 of its observation also expressly asserts, and they did again so today, that the applicant denied participating in a public assembly and did not raise the substance of the Article 11 complaint in the domestic courts.

<<4148.7;4165.7;en>>
There is, of course, then for the government the procedurally prior question, what you say is the adequate and effective remedy you say the applicant should have exhausted, and what evidence is there that confirms its adequacy and effectiveness.

<<4165.7;4175.7;en>>
The second block of question goes to Article 11 and deals with, again, the first element of it is addressed to the applicant.

<<4175.7;4203.7;en>>
The government's assertion, both in writing and today, that the applicant denied participating in a public assembly leads me to the question to ask, on what basis do you say, especially in relation to the solo picket on 27 October 2012 and the arrest while waiting outside the courthouse on 24 February 2014, that Article 11 was in fact engaged at all?

<<4203.7;4212.7;en>>
After all, as this court held in Tata and Farber v. Hungary, the term assembly under Article 11 has an autonomous meaning,

<<4212.7;4227.7;en>>
I pause here to query whether waiting outside a court building is even an expression, and that fits into Judge Nussberg's question, occurs in the public space, does not necessarily turn such event into an assembly.

<<4227.7;4231.7;en>>
Now that, of course, then leads me to the follow-up question for the government.

<<4231.7;4241.7;en>>
In that same case, this court reasoned that such an autonomous meaning serves the interests of the protection of the right against improper classification in national law.

<<4241.7;4244.7;en>>
The example the court gives in that case may well be pertinent to the present case.

<<4244.7;4269.7;en>>
It is this. By relying on the domestic law on assemblies and by implication of the court's case law in the context of Article 11, which accepts in principle that the imposition of prior notification may be justified, the authorities in that case were said to seek to create a prior restraint on the freedom of expression, which is incompatible with the free communication of ideas and might undermine freedom of expression.

<<4269.7;4295.7;en>>
The question for the government is this. Would you accept that reliance on the law of assemblies to justify the applicant's arrest, at least in relation to the two incidents identified, amount or might amount to an improper classification by the domestic authorities and or the courts, and or is capable of providing evidence relevant to the assessment of the applicant's complaint of bad faith or ulterior motives, which is currently pleaded under Article 18?

<<4295.7;4313.7;en>>
And finally, in relation to that complaint about bad faith and ulterior motive, of course, the government in its further observations in paragraph 28 relies on Article 17, abuse of rights in relation to an aspect of the applicant's claim.

<<4313.7;4326.7;en>>
The question I have is the case on bad faith and ulterior motives is, of course, currently pleaded and responded to under Article 18 of the Convention, limitation on the use of rights, on the restriction on rights.

<<4326.7;4346.7;en>>
Questions of both parties is this. Is there any reason why the court should be limited to considering this complaint solely by reference to Article 18 and why it could not also be classified as an abuse of rights under Article 17, an article which I said you raise, the government raises in relation to the applicant's complaint?

<<4346.7;4367.7;en>>
After all, in so far as relevant, that article provides that nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any state any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth therein or, perhaps importantly in this case, at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.

<<4367.7;4369.2;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<4369.2;4370.2;en>>
Thank you.

<<4376.51;4380.75;en>>
Thank you Mr. President. My question goes to the applicant.

<<4380.75;4395.19;en>>
The agent of the government just presented some statistical data concerning the rallies organized by the applicant or by your movement saying that many of them have been authorized, regularly authorized.

<<4395.19;4398.63;en>>
Do you contest or confirm such affirmation?

Please be seated.

<<4529.75;4534.75;en>>
The hearing is resumed and I call Mrs. Maralyan.

<<4534.75;4534.75;en>>
Please.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<4541.88;4543.6;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

<<4543.6;4550.84;en>>
First of all, I would like to briefly comment the government's submissions, oral submissions.

<<4550.84;4559.52;en>>
The government insists that the applicant recognizes that he has breached national laws.

<<4559.52;4568.92;en>>
However, there was no submission made by the applicant written or oral that will lead to such a conclusion.

<<4568.92;4580.2;en>>
The applicant states that, referring to the court's case law, that the states have the right to have prior authorization requirement.

<<4580.2;4582.88;en>>
However, this should be also proportionate.

<<4582.88;4589.16;en>>
That was the idea of the applicant submitted in his written and oral submissions.

<<4589.16;4609.92;en>>
As to the hindrance of the traffic mentioned by the government in their written and oral submissions, the applicant states that he did not anyhow hinder the free circulation of the traffic or pedestrians, taking into consideration, first, the time and the amount of people.

<<4609.92;4623.08;en>>
The applicant also draws the court's attention to the fact that there were so many police officers that, in fact, that there was the police force that somehow could hinder the traffic, but not the applicant himself.

<<4623.08;4631.44;en>>
Especially taking into consideration, for example, his solo picketing, after which he was detained, arrested and detained.

<<4631.44;4645.48;en>>
So it is interesting enough that a person who is walking down the street after the solo picketing, but is surrounded with some journalists, he cannot control those journalists.

<<4645.48;4649.88;en>>
And they couldn't anyhow hinder their free circulation.

<<4649.88;4662.84;en>>
Especially taking into consideration that, in Moscow, there are so many people that it is a usual thing for Moscow to have many people in the streets.

<<4662.84;4665.8;en>>
That was not a village where Mr. Navalny was

<<4665.8;4672.84;en>>
with the journalists, who could somehow make some nuisance to the people in that village.

<<4676.04;4683.74;en>>
Now, I would like to turn to the questions posed by the court to the applicant.

<<4683.74;4691.84;en>>
The court is absolutely right to state that the applicant did not claim violation of Article 18 in all the applications.

<<4691.84;4696.68;en>>
However, the question was not raised only in the first applications.

<<4696.68;4701.36;en>>
The last applications of the applicant also raised this issue.

<<4701.36;4713.32;en>>
The applicant demonstrated in the observations before the chamber that the applicant's right under Article 18 was violated.

<<4713.32;4720.24;en>>
So he raised this question in their observations and gave some response.

<<4720.24;4731.32;en>>
Furthermore, the chamber itself declared the applicant's claims under Article 18 in conjunction with Articles 5 and 11 as admissible.

<<4731.32;4744.76;en>>
So the court couldn't declare this case admissible if the applicant failed somehow to prove that there were reasons to consider that there was violation of this article.

<<4744.76;4753.88;en>>
Furthermore, dissenting judges considered that the applicant had proved the violation of Article 18 of the Convention.

<<4753.88;4776.64;en>>
As to the question in respect of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Articles 5 and 11, the applicant refers to the court's well-established case law that requests exhaustion only of effective remedies.

<<4776.64;4791.48;en>>
As the applicant has stated in his oral submissions, surprisingly, the judicial system somehow failed to be objective and reasonable while dealing with the cases of the applicant.

<<4791.48;4798.5;en>>
And it is seen statistically and also seen by the judgments made by this very court.

<<4804.32;4814.6;en>>
In this case, the applicant states that the respondent's state judicial system cannot be considered as an effective remedy.

<<4814.6;4825.0;en>>
Nevertheless, the applicant did his best to exhaust the available remedies in the Russian Federation.

<<4825.0;4841.88;en>>
As to the question in respect of the applicant's denial before the national courts that he participated in conducting demonstrations, the applicant reaffirms this position as, first, he did not conduct any demonstrations.

<<4841.88;4851.36;en>>
He did not, in those episodes that are under examination of this court, he did not use any loudspeakers.

<<4851.36;4855.28;en>>
He did not chant any slogans.

<<4855.28;4864.32;en>>
He didn't do anything that could be considered as a conduct of a demonstration.

<<4864.32;4876.8;en>>
Further, he insists that he participated in peaceful assemblies, including solo picketing, as was mentioned, after which he was detained.

<<4876.8;4896.24;en>>
It is important to note that solo picketings, there is no requirement set up by the law of the Russian Federation that there should be a prior authorization to have to hold a solo picketing.

<<4896.24;4910.28;en>>
As to the assembly of 14 February, 2014, the applicant was, it is important to state that the applicant was among those who wished to be present at the hearing on Blotner case.

<<4910.28;4927.4;en>>
However, the national courts made a decision to ban the presence of the public at this hearing and to halt the hearing without the public presence.

<<4927.4;4931.64;en>>
So that was a prize for those who wanted to participate at that hearing.

<<4931.64;4933.08;en>>
And what was the reaction?

<<4933.08;4937.0;en>>
They just waited outside of the courthouse.

<<4937.0;4947.18;en>>
This cannot be, however, based on this one, cannot conclude that they were just people gathering there nearby the courthouse.

<<4947.18;4962.64;en>>
These were people who have concerns that the hearings on Blotner case will not be fair and who wanted to somehow peacefully support these people outside of the courthouse.

<<4962.64;4972.24;en>>
It is also noteworthy that the applicant was, in this very episode, the applicant was apprehended shortly after his arrival.

<<4972.24;4990.96;en>>
And it is very clearly seen in the video provided by the applicant that he was targeted and he was taken to the police vans without a single word, without any explanation why he is apprehended and what is the reason.

<<4990.96;4995.74;en>>
And it was not that all of the people were apprehended and taken to the police stations.

<<4995.74;4997.12;en>>
That was the applicant.

<<4997.12;5004.68;en>>
The applicant was surrounded by the riot police and taken to the police vans.

<<5004.68;5006.68;en>>
Yes.

<<5006.68;5013.68;en>>
I'm sorry.

<<5013.68;5034.28;en>>
And as to the last question regarding Article 17, the applicant states that Article 17 cannot anyhow be applicable here, as he did not have any intention to intentionally breach any law.

<<5034.28;5047.32;en>>
And it is proven by this court also when the court found in many occasions that the applicant's rights under Article 5, 6 were violated by the national authorities.

<<5047.32;5047.32;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5049.18;5052.62;en>>
Thank you very much, Mrs. Maralyan.

<<5053.82;5057.34;en>>
Shall I consider from the applicant side, you have finished?

<<5058.22;5058.94;en>>
Thank you.

<<5059.26;5060.22;en>>
Shall I call Mr.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<5060.22;5064.86;en>>
We have also one patient and Mr. Navalnyy will address it.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5064.86;5066.38;en>>
Please, Mr. Navalny, you have the floor.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<5067.18;5068.18;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<5068.18;5074.82;en>>
Mr. President, first of all, I want to say that it was really a pleasure to listen what

<<5074.82;5082.46;en>>
a nice, comfortable political life I have in Moscow with my colleagues.

<<5082.46;5087.54;en>>
Short-term sentences, non-substantial fines, this is really very nice.

<<5087.54;5088.58;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<5088.58;5095.58;en>>
Of course, compared to Mr. Nelson Mandela, my life, my political life in Moscow is much

<<5095.58;5096.96;en>>
easier.

<<5096.96;5104.3;en>>
I want to address this question about statistics of the meeting.

<<5104.3;5118.34;en>>
And I want to say that this is a typical example of manipulation of facts and trying to trick this court, the statement that we have in 95 percent, we have authorization for our rallies.

<<5118.34;5127.54;en>>
And I'm very glad that our respectful opponent mentioned the national rally we have on this Sunday.

<<5127.54;5129.14;en>>
Yes, it's true.

<<5129.14;5136.1;en>>
We have authorization for this rally, which we have in more than 100 cities all over Russia.

<<5136.1;5141.5;en>>
But the question is, do we have authorization in Moscow, in St. Petersburg, in the major

<<5141.5;5142.48;en>>
cities?

<<5142.48;5143.94;en>>
The answer is no.

<<5143.94;5153.54;en>>
So technically, yes, but they give us this permission in the way of another political humiliation.

<<5153.54;5158.02;en>>
We don't allow to have our rallies in the centers of the city.

<<5158.02;5163.82;en>>
They give us permission for the far districts or literally in the far parks.

<<5163.82;5171.82;en>>
For example, this Sunday, they have a proposition for us to have a rally literally in the woods, in the park Sokolniki.

<<5171.82;5187.1;en>>
And of course, definitely I wrote in my blog that we will never agree to such a proposition, that we have our right to have our rallies in the same places when the pro-government movement have their rallies.

<<5187.1;5199.42;en>>
And obviously, in Russia now we have a major political events, election, and a lot of people are very disappointed that we have a non-competitive election.

<<5199.42;5208.22;en>>
It's at least half of population, and we definitely have our right to go in the centers of our city and have such rallies.

<<5208.22;5218.82;en>>
The same for situation with this rallies on election, which was mentioned by the government agent.

<<5218.82;5224.86;en>>
Yes, they have a reason to say, we gave you a lot of permission, but you, Mr. Navalny,

<<5224.86;5235.3;en>>
like a spoiled baby, don't want to use these permissions, and you are, as a government agent said, want to be arrested.

<<5235.3;5240.3;en>>
And you are literally harassing Russian government and asking to be arrested.

<<5240.3;5246.06;en>>
But the key issues, time and location.

<<5246.06;5261.98;en>>
Like we have authorization to have my meeting with the, during election, in the seven in the morning, on Monday, on kind of abandoned stadium.

<<5261.98;5268.46;en>>
This is vast majority of what they call permission for the rallies.

<<5268.46;5270.82;en>>
Of course, we cannot agree with that.

<<5270.82;5284.02;en>>
Of course, in this situation, I understand that there is a risk of being arrested, but I cannot, we cannot take such a condition of political game.

<<5284.02;5289.86;en>>
They have everything, and we should have our meetings in the seven in the morning on Monday.

<<5289.86;5300.2;en>>
So I want to, that's why I asked this court to consider the whole political context around this cases.

<<5300.2;5302.3;en>>
It's not just about five cases.

<<5302.3;5308.5;en>>
The system of ignoring our right to freedom of assembly.

<<5308.5;5318.22;en>>
How many times during last five years, me and my colleagues have a permission to have a meeting in the center of Moscow?

<<5318.22;5319.74;en>>
Within last five years?

<<5319.74;5320.84;en>>
Zero times.

<<5320.84;5324.22;en>>
How many times we have such a permission in St. Petersburg?

<<5324.22;5325.22;en>>
Zero times.

<<5325.22;5335.66;en>>
How many times other people who want to have a rally against corruption have their permission to organize meeting in the center of major city?

<<5335.66;5336.94;en>>
Zero times.

<<5336.94;5338.98;en>>
The question is timing.

<<5338.98;5340.94;en>>
The question is location.

<<5340.94;5346.58;en>>
And their permission is actually act of political humiliation of opposition.

<<5346.58;5347.58;en>>
Thank you very much.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5348.08;5352.64;en>>
Thank you very much Mr. Navalnyy. Now I call Mr. Galperin, please.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<5354.49;5356.21;en>>
Thank you very much.

<<5356.77;5370.09;en>>
And I was glad to hear answering analysis of the applicant that he understands in all times that he will be arrested if he will go to the non-agreed manifestations and he continues to do that.

<<5370.09;5376.91;en>>
And also for the permission of the court, I will start with the very brief comments of the applicant's allegations.

<<5376.91;5386.61;en>>
And when he was a quote of the answering of the President Putin on the press conference and comparing the applicant with Mr. Saakashvili,

<<5386.61;5410.73;en>>
and I'm not authorized for sure to comment that, but however, from my personal standpoint, they have very much in common taking into account first the violence and violent manifestations around them and third, that the crowd several times tried to pull them out of the police bus.

<<5410.73;5414.33;en>>
So I think that's sort of was the correct comparison.

<<5414.33;5425.81;en>>
Also answering on allegations of the applicant telling that applicants councils, telling that the police bus stayed far away from the manifestations.

<<5426.81;5455.29;en>>
And it is, I think, all policemen will confirm that as soon as the leader of the protest inside the police bus, the police by becoming the center of manifestation of any manifestation, people staying around that and which the court has seen on video provided rather by the applicant and numerous video in YouTube when we see these events.

<<5455.29;5464.05;en>>
Also, we emphasize that there was no any argument, new argument in applicant and applicant council submissions.

<<5464.05;5471.77;en>>
And also the applicant party failed to rise any specific arguments on article 14.

<<5471.77;5485.41;en>>
And also I was glad to hear answering on honorable judge question about article 17, that applicant side have no reason to see the article 17 in this case.

<<5485.41;5491.61;en>>
We also emphasize that the applicant has failed to comment on many issues relevant in the present proceedings.

<<5491.61;5504.41;en>>
So we believe that in many times, the applicant and applicant council refuse from giving statements and submissions, which were asked by this court in the questions before said beforehand.

<<5504.41;5510.17;en>>
Also, from the permission of the court, I will answer the questions of the honorable judges.

<<5510.17;5528.21;en>>
And first to the going to the question from Judge Nussberger, I will say that it is obvious that there is some legal act which regulates the details of procedure during the decision making by the police during the mass events.

<<5528.21;5531.09;en>>
And this decision is a strategy and tactics of that.

<<5531.09;5537.45;en>>
And the particular situation is taking to the account and concrete circumstances of the case.

<<5537.45;5556.29;en>>
And usually, and that is why it is important to pray and form authorities about meetings because then the special police headquarters are created in this part of the meeting, which is usually led in Moscow and St. Petersburg

<<5556.33;5568.29;en>>
by the officer or really general level person who decide in the situation how the police should act in this special meeting.

<<5568.29;5581.37;en>>
Also, the general strategy is to isolate most active protesters to make sure that the tension is decreased and the possible gross violation of law won't happen.

<<5581.37;5599.05;en>>
Also, as regard to the difference between the ordinary queue to the court and manifestation, it is quite simple since participants in the event stayed and expressed their views and using posters, including political posters in front of the court.

<<5599.05;5601.05;en>>
So it surely is not a queue.

<<5601.05;5614.49;en>>
And I would assure this High Court that the access to the court in Russian Federation under the constitution is absolutely free for any person, not just for the participants of the hearings.

<<5614.49;5625.45;en>>
And I would say also, and the applicants' counsels told that this was the only applicant who was captured from this crowd of people staying in front of the court.

<<5625.45;5627.77;en>>
And I would assure that he was not alone.

<<5627.77;5636.41;en>>
And most of that people stayed there and were really apprehended by the police in that day.

<<5636.41;5651.97;en>>
Also, going to the question of Judge Ravarani, Russia never used severe methods for apprehension of the manifestations.

<<5651.97;5667.53;en>>
As I said, and I think that the applicant also could confirm that as the very often participant of that manifestation, police never uses batons, as I said, dogs, any weapon against manifestators.

<<5667.53;5673.21;en>>
To compare also to some of the, and most of the councils of Europe countries.

<<5673.21;5678.13;en>>
So it's, I think, couldn't be called as severe.

<<5678.13;5688.89;en>>
Our case today is the best example, really, of peaceful actions of the police with no special means were used at all in these manifestations.

<<5688.89;5702.69;en>>
And as I said, and it was also seen on the video provided by the applicant himself, they started with verbal invitations and warnings which were ignored by the manifestators.

<<5702.69;5737.81;en>>
And now going to the Judge Ike question about Article 17, and we believe, and as I understand, it's also the applicant's opinion on that, that it requires comprehensive analysis, and we believe that this court shouldn't expand the subject on the case by adding additional articles since we don't see any additional Article 18 to Articles 5, 6, or 11 in this case as we put that in the numerous written submissions of the government.

<<5737.81;5750.69;en>>
However, if the new article requirements would be ordered by this Honorable Court, this requires additional observations and recommunication if the court will decide on that.

<<5750.69;5756.93;en>>
Therefore, we're subject to invite the parties to submit observation on this case additionally if the court decides then.

<<5756.93;5763.57;en>>
However, we don't see any Article 17 in this case with regard to the government.

<<5763.57;5787.85;en>>
Regarding the question about the effective remedies to be exhausted in Russia, we as a government provided extensive examples of these remedies to the court and the text of the court acts of Russian courts where applicants really rose these issues before the Russian courts in three cases and where it was considered by Russian court.

<<5787.85;5800.21;en>>
But in all other cases, the applicant and applicants' counsel failed to do that in front of the national authorities.

<<5800.21;5805.45;en>>
So that is why and that concludes my answering.

<<5805.45;5806.49;en>>
And thank you very much.

<<5806.49;5806.49;en>>
And if you have no further questions.

[[JudgeP;Guido Raimondi]]

<<5809.37;5812.57;en>>
Thank you very much Mr. Galperin.

<<5812.57;5817.53;en>>
And we have now come to the end of the hearing.

<<5817.53;5822.97;en>>
I thank the parties for their submissions and answers to the court's questions.

<<5822.97;5826.41;en>>
The court will now deliberate on the merits.

<<5826.41;5828.89;en>>
The judgment will be delivered later.

<<5828.89;5832.81;en>>
The parties will be informed of the date of delivery.

<<5832.81;5832.81;en>>
I declare the hearing closed.

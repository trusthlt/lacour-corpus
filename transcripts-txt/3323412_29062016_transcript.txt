I declare open the public hearing on the admissibility and merits in the case of Al-Nashiri versus Romania.

<<62.17;77.95;en>>
The application was lodged with the court on 1st June 2012 under Article 34 of the Convention by a Saudi Arabian national, Mr. Abd Al Rahim Husseyn Muhammad Al Nashiri

<<79.99;95.53;en>>

[[Government;GR1]]

<<273.36;277.88;en>>
Thank you for giving me the floor, Madam President, Honourable Members of the Court.

<<277.88;290.72;en>>
We appear before you today to present the Romanian Government's position in this case concerning the alleged secret detention and ill-treatment of the applicant Abdal Rahim Husein Muhammad Al-Mashiri on Romanian soil.

<<290.72;306.28;en>>
Following the questions that this Court indicated the parties were to answer during this public hearing, I will, in the first part of our intervention, address the issue of state's responsibility in connection to the events invoked by the applicant's representatives.

<<306.28;324.84;en>>
I will then kindly ask you to give the floor to my colleague, who will present our arguments on the effectiveness of the investigation carried out by the Romanian authorities, both prior and subsequent to the criminal complaint lodged by the applicant's representatives before the domestic investigative bodies.

<<324.84;335.56;en>>
Madam President, before plunging into the issue of state's responsibility, allow us to make some preliminary remarks on the general context of the case and on its admissibility.

<<335.56;344.84;en>>
Firstly, as a member of the international community, Romania is profoundly attached to the values of democracy, rule of law, promotion and protection of human rights.

<<344.84;355.64;en>>
The issue of alleged secret detention, flights and facilities was always approached in the spirit of sharing the universally recognised foundations of a democratic state.

<<355.64;365.48;en>>
The Government could not but regret the treatment the applicant was subjected to, treatment documented by official information released by third countries on this issue.

<<365.48;372.62;en>>
As the Court rightly put it, torture and ill-treatment are not acceptable, not even in the harshest circumstances.

<<372.62;381.64;en>>
Still, the Government maintained their position that no proof emerged to confirm that such treatment occurred under Romanian jurisdiction.

<<381.64;400.64;en>>
In this context, we consider appropriate to underline from the very beginning that there was no blunt denial regarding the CIA HVD programmes, nor did our State reject in a rigid and arbitrary manner the allegations concerning its potential involvement in these programmes.

<<400.64;421.04;en>>
The negative answer to the existence of suspected flights or secret detention facilities was given by our authorities after consultation, inquiry, in a manner of cooperation that was not always recognised by the different international investigations, but that is showed by various responses that we will present during these oral pleadings.

<<421.04;435.28;en>>
However, we consider it deplorable that inferences of critical weight have been drawn from the negative answer alone, without just significance being attributed to the cooperative spirit shown by the authorities.

<<435.28;448.8;en>>
It is not possible, nor admissible, to consider that only a positive answer to these allegations would satisfy the threshold of cooperation and transparency required by these international demarches.

<<448.8;461.32;en>>
Secondly, before addressing the merits of the case, we would like to reiterate that we maintain all the objections as to the admissibility of the present application as detailed in our written submissions.

<<461.32;466.88;en>>
The Government does not ignore the Court's findings in its recent Nasser and Ghali judgement.

<<466.88;485.34;en>>
Still, as required by the principles of subsidiarity and legal certainty, this Court can only be seized with an application once the existing domestic remedies have been exhausted and only in a time limit of six months from the final domestic decision.

<<485.34;499.0;en>>
In the case at hand, we cannot but notice that the applicant's representatives lodged the present application two days after presenting a criminal complaint before the Romanian competent investigative body.

<<499.0;511.32;en>>
While we accept that with the passing of time, the objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies could find itself obsolete, in the present situation, the facts point to the contrary.

<<511.32;525.08;en>>
The domestic investigation is still ongoing, and even if the investigative phase were before the prosecutor were completed, the solution would at least be submitted to a Court for a legality evaluation.

<<525.08;528.62;en>>
This evaluation could lead to the reopening of the investigation.

<<528.62;536.78;en>>
At the same time, the investigative phase could end with an indictment, and criminal proceedings before Court would follow.

<<536.78;545.76;en>>
Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the introduction of the criminal complaint lead the Government to invoke the non-respect of the six-month rule.

<<545.76;561.9;en>>
Thus, the applicant's representatives themselves acknowledged that the criminal complaint was filed only as a precautionary measure, the applicant believing from the start that domestic remedies in Romania were plainly ineffective.

<<561.9;570.72;en>>
The attitude is also confirmed by the more than limited interest manifested by the applicant's representatives for the internal investigation.

<<570.72;588.6;en>>
For a period of two and a half years, they did not take any step in order to participate in the criminal investigation, and when they finally did, they asked for a piece of information that was already in their possession, namely the number allotted to the criminal investigation file.

<<588.6;611.28;en>>
At this point of our oral submission, we have to stress that in his application lodged against Poland on 6 May 2011, the applicant affirmed that he was moved from Guantanamo Bay to Rabat and then to another CIA prison in Bucharest, Romania, sometime after 27 March 2004.

<<611.28;626.8;en>>
It follows that even though the applicant had knowledge about Romania's alleged involvement in his secret detention, at least from 6 May 2011, he chose to refer his accusations to the Romanian authorities and to this court only a year later.

<<626.8;650.16;en>>
The applicant explained this delay by showing that only on 8 December 2011 did details relating to the precise location of the prison in Romania become known, without arguing why the alleged location of the secret prison on Romanian territory had such an important bearing on his decision to present an application against our state.

<<650.16;657.04;en>>
Madam President, Honorable Judges, with your kind permission, I will now address the issue of state responsibility.

<<657.04;665.04;en>>
In this matter, as your court constantly accepted, the necessary reference is to general international law standards.

<<665.04;677.08;en>>
According to international law, in order for an act to be classified as an international wrongful act engaging the state's responsibility, that act must be attributable to a state.

<<677.08;707.36;en>>
Summarizing the principles of responsibility codified by the International Law Commission on this topic, one could refer either to direct knowledge and involvement in an international wrongful conduct, or to the indirect knowledge inferred from the assumption that a state exercising its jurisdiction over its territory should not ignore the perpetration of the international wrongful act within the border of its territorial jurisdiction.

<<707.36;723.28;en>>
For the purpose of better understanding the responsibility that would have been engaged had there been in Romania a secret detention facility, it is necessary to distinguish from the perspective of state responsibility different scenarios on the state's attitude and conduct.

<<723.28;742.72;en>>
Its potential agreement on putting a facility at the disposal of another state, its knowledge on the exact purpose of the operation of a secret detention facility, the exercise of state's authority over that facility, the knowingly permitted use of its territory for activities implying human rights violations.

<<742.72;764.76;en>>
Madam President, no information was put forward by the documents and other evidence adduced to the file of this case by the international inquiries or by the non-governmental sources to indicate that the Romanian authorities put in place and ran, autonomously or in cooperation with a third state, such a secret detention facility.

<<764.76;780.2;en>>
No information advanced the idea that the Romanian authorities knowingly and expressly accepted, after being briefed on the goal or activities that were to be performed in that facility, to put such a location at the disposal of third parties.

<<780.2;794.68;en>>
Therefore, the only possible approach from the state's responsibility perspective would be to determine if it had knowingly permitted its territory being used by another state for activities implying human rights violations.

<<794.68;819.52;en>>
In this case, the question is whether, following public awareness regarding the secret detention program, the authorities should have become aware of the fact that the flights operated on the territory of Romania were CIA-operated flights, and from this they should have inferred that there was a secret detention facility in Romania as well, and act in accordance with their obligation of due diligence.

<<819.52;824.52;en>>
Relevant for this type of state responsibility is the Kofu Channel case.

<<824.52;844.0;en>>
In this case, decided by the International Court of Justice, the world jurisdiction established the threshold required for circumstantial evidences underlying that, quote, a charge of such exceptional gravity against the state would require a degree of certainty, end quote.

<<844.0;866.96;en>>
Moreover, the ICJ considered that, quote, it cannot be concluded from the mere facts of the control exercised by a state over its territory and waters that that state necessarily knew or ought to have known of any unlawful act perpetrated therein, nor yet that it necessarily knew or should have known the authors.

<<866.96;877.2;en>>
This fact by itself and apart from other circumstances neither involves prima facie responsibility nor shifts the burden of proof.

<<877.2;885.8;en>>
The ICJ considered as well the issue of indirect proof and admitted that indirect evidence is accepted in all systems of law.

<<885.8;897.08;en>>
However, it concluded that, quote, the proof may be drawn from inferences of fact provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt, end quote.

<<897.08;916.92;en>>
Madam President, your court also accepts that with regard to the establishment of facts and the assessment of evidence, only the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear, and coherent inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact may be considered as proof.

<<916.92;922.8;en>>
In the case at hand, no such strong, clear, or concordant inferences exist.

<<922.8;939.76;en>>
It is the firm position of the government, supported by the court's case law, that not only objective elements related to the existence of a certain fact or event must be adduced, but also that the subjective attitude of the state must be taken into account.

<<939.76;952.36;en>>
The government do not intend to challenge the existence of the special detention program operated by the CIA, the fact that the applicant was subjected to this program, or the treatment he received.

<<952.36;959.06;en>>
These are objectively established factual elements attested by official documents released by a third country.

<<959.06;965.84;en>>
The government do not intend to deny the landing and takeoff of several flights on Romanian airports.

<<965.84;978.48;en>>
These flights are at least partly documented by the Romanian Senate's report in 2008, and publicly available evidence confirmed their stop on Romanian soil.

<<978.48;995.88;en>>
However, beyond the subjective elements, the government considers that no evidence has been produced to show the smallest degree of knowledge on the alleged hidden purpose of the flights landing in and taking off from Romanian airports.

<<995.88;1016.04;en>>
Thus, only in November 2005, as attested yesterday by expert number two, did the first information about the alleged existence in some Eastern European countries of secret detention facilities designated for suspected terrorists and run by the CIA surface in the media.

<<1016.04;1032.08;en>>
To this date, the only information available concerned the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Jordan, and the specific case concerning the surrender of six Algerian men by Bosnian Federal Police into U.S. custody.

<<1032.08;1040.04;en>>
The information also made statement of the establishment of military commissions set up for trying persons accused of terrorist acts.

<<1040.04;1053.2;en>>
However, the identity of those persons was unknown, as was the decision of the third state as to the person that were to actually be tried before military jurisdiction or before federal courts.

<<1053.2;1069.2;en>>
At the relevant time, from 2003 to 2005, there was no information that would have allowed European states to suspect that some of the American flights that landed in Europe were used for the transfer of prisoners.

<<1069.2;1077.56;en>>
As for the allegedly suspicious flights, it should be noted that they represented private non-commercial flights and were treated as such.

<<1077.56;1086.28;en>>
Invoices were issued for all the services performed, as well as air navigation services sheets or ground handling charge notes.

<<1086.28;1091.6;en>>
The flights were included in the control lists of the navigation records.

<<1091.6;1098.72;en>>
Several remarks regarding the change of the flight plans and the authorization of non-commercial flights need to be made.

<<1098.72;1108.16;en>>
Of great significance, the report and media are drawn from them in postulating the involvement of the state in the applicants' detention and in treatment.

<<1108.16;1115.16;en>>
In accordance with the relevant domestic and international regulations, every flight must have a flight plan.

<<1115.16;1125.48;en>>
Except for emergency issues, no possibility to land on other airports than the one indicated as destination or alternate destination exists.

<<1125.48;1130.64;en>>
Each flight plan must indicate beside the destination an alternate one.

<<1130.64;1134.54;en>>
The flight plan is established by the aircraft's operator.

<<1134.54;1147.96;en>>
The only potential involvement of authorities is limited to help with the transmission of the flight plan to the entity managing the integrated initial flight plan processing system.

<<1147.96;1158.68;en>>
The decision to use the alternate destination or the change of flight plan in flight is a unilateral action by the flight operator.

<<1158.68;1169.48;en>>
In our opinion, the acceptance of these changes in the flight plans is not indicative of a complicity of the Romanian authorities, as the said acceptance is in fact automatic.

<<1169.48;1193.24;en>>
Moreover, the apparent high number of flights from those analyzed by experts that had recourse to such a change should be evaluated in the context of general statistics on the number of flights managed by the domestic aviation authority daily, from more than 1,000 at the material time of fact to over 3,000 nowadays.

<<1193.24;1199.76;en>>
Some explanations are required also with regard to the authorization of private non-commercial flights.

<<1199.76;1219.72;en>>
According to domestic regulations, private international non-commercial flights on an ATS route did not need a special approval as such a flight was considered authorized following the filing of a flight plan, similar provisions being applicable in the case of a change of destination.

<<1219.72;1236.24;en>>
As for the STS state indicator, the government kindly asked the court to notice in the first place that such designation is vetted by the national authorities of the flag state and are directly opposable to third countries.

<<1236.24;1248.28;en>>
Moreover, according to the relevant rules, flights using STS state indicator shall not automatically qualify for exemption from any relevant flow regulations.

<<1248.28;1258.24;en>>
In fact, the only benefit deriving from such designation refers to ensuring a double vertical separation between airplanes.

<<1258.24;1278.16;en>>
Reason number three, although repeatedly asked, could not indicate any of the special privileges that STS state designation would entail, even if various reports have underlined this aspect as being of exceptional relevance when analyzing flight data.

<<1278.16;1304.4;en>>
As for the N85VM flight of 12 April 2004, the available documents attest that the flight was recorded in the table containing handling fees as well as in the control list of navigation records, that an invoice was issued and that the payment was operated by card, a copy of the air routing card being attached to the relevant documents.

<<1304.4;1316.84;en>>
Comparing the aforementioned aspects to the procedures followed by the American flight in Poland, as noted by the court in the Al-Nashiri judgment, the government cannot but notice the differences.

<<1316.84;1330.8;en>>
In our case, the documents mentioned above, as well as the documents available in the criminal file, show that the N flights went through the standard handling flow and payment was made in an account.

<<1330.8;1343.08;en>>
Also, the government contends that the Romanians could not, in any circumstance, be held reliable for having issued a false landing permit, as the court held in the Al-Nashiri v. Poland

<<1343.08;1361.68;en>>
case, seeing that, in fact, after 11 November 2003, no such permits were issued and that overflight and non-commercial stopovers were allowed only on the basis of the submitted flight plan and of a valid insurance.

<<1361.68;1366.5;en>>
Important differences can be noted also with regard to the witnesses' depositions.

<<1366.5;1378.08;en>>
The picture painted by the declarations of the people working at Bonesa Airport is entirely different from the image of the Shimani Airport, as retained by the court in the Al-Nashiri judgment.

<<1378.08;1382.8;en>>
No foreign vehicles were seen entering the premises of the Bonesa Airport.

<<1382.8;1406.84;en>>
There was no military intervention in order to secure the airport perimeter, and most certainly, American officials did not assume control of the airport on the date in question, and no HVDs were seen entering the country, as witnesses quoted in the 207 Marty report stated with regard to the Shimani Airport.

<<1406.84;1414.16;en>>
At this point, some clarifications are needed also as far as the alleged location of the secret detention facility is concerned.

<<1414.16;1428.48;en>>
In 2007, Senator Marty seemed convinced, quoting reliable sources within the CIA, that a secure area for CIA transfers and detentions had been created near the Mikhail Kogalnichanu Airport.

<<1428.48;1436.08;en>>
In 2009, the New York Times quoted officials saying that one jail was a renovated building on a busy street in Bucharest.

<<1436.08;1449.36;en>>
In 2011, other reliable sources indicated the Onis building, which is located in a residential area and not on a busy street, as the site of the secret CIA detention center in Bucharest.

<<1449.36;1460.24;en>>
The experts found arguments supporting their theories with a surprising ease, without analyzing the contradictions and choosing from the previous reports only the convenient elements.

<<1460.24;1480.0;en>>
For example, Senator Marty compared the system used at Mikhail Kogalnichanu Airfield with the system used at Kabul Airport, while Commissioner Hammerberg found support for his assertions regarding the use of the Onis building in the fact that a precedent consisting in the use of an existing state facility had been found in Poland.

<<1480.0;1491.52;en>>
No attention was given to the obvious differences between a remote location and a building used on a daily basis by government officials in a European capital.

<<1491.52;1511.92;en>>
Also statements from persons working and living near the Onis building, arguing that if a secret prison had been there, they would have seen some activity, such as suspicious vehicles, were ignored, invoking the Romanian communist past and the fact that the Romanians don't have the tendency to snoop around due to their fear of a repressive regime.

<<1511.92;1524.4;en>>
On the contrary, in Lithuania, also a former communist country, testimonies by witnesses living near the alleged secret location were considered relevant for the establishment of facts.

<<1524.4;1536.08;en>>
Given this element, it seems to us that the Norman conclusion reaching process was reversed in the case of Romania and that any arguments were used in order to support a pre-established conclusion.

<<1536.08;1545.68;en>>
Madam President, Honorable Members of the Court, it takes more than hints of speculations to establish a state responsibility.

<<1545.68;1564.0;en>>
For all the elements at the government's disposal, elements adduced to the file, it is our contention that no aspect related to the Romanian state responsibility for the detention and ill-treatment of the applicant and for its subsequent transfers can be established beyond reasonable doubt in the present case.

<<1564.0;1569.0;en>>
Madam President, for the second part of our oral pleading, I kindly ask you to give the floor to my colleague.

[[Government;GR2]]

<<1574.27;1576.43;en>>
Thank you, Madam President.

<<1576.43;1586.87;en>>
Madam President, Honorable Judges, my task today before you is to present the essential elements that, from our perspective, show the in-depth analysis performed by the domestic authorities.

<<1586.87;1598.79;en>>
Firstly, the government kindly asked the Court to depart from the opinions expressed with regard to the work of the Romanian Senate's Investigation Committee and to observe the complex nature of its inquiry.

<<1598.79;1607.79;en>>
The previously classified annexes to the Senate report helped to shed some light on the work of the Committee and prove the thorough nature of the investigation.

<<1607.79;1625.79;en>>
Information was requested and received concerning the purpose of the allegedly suspicious flights, the service rendered by the civil handling agents, as well as about the diplomatic overflight requests received by the Ministry of National Defense from the United States Embassy from 2001 to 2005.

<<1625.79;1633.49;en>>
The declassified annexes support the conclusion that the purpose of the end flight stops at Baniasa Airport was mainly a technical one.

<<1633.49;1644.41;en>>
Also, as stated in the report, it should be noted that the Investigation Committee carried out on-site investigations at all the airports mentioned by relevant international reports.

<<1644.41;1666.25;en>>
Furthermore, contrary to information presented in the FAVA report, the Investigation Committee's work, including the hearing of over 200 persons with attributions regarding flight records, verification, coordination, and on-ground security and services, as well as 14 meetings with official delegations, other politicians, and journalists.

<<1666.25;1684.51;en>>
The government underlined that the conclusions of the Investigation Committee were not simple statements, but the result of a real work of investigation extended from January 2006 to January 2007, whose value should not be underestimated only on the basis of the alleged lack of independence of its author.

<<1684.51;1695.71;en>>
As an additional point, during the discussions in the Romanian Senate of the said report, it was revealed that Senator Marti had declined all invitations from the committee to visit our country.

<<1695.71;1727.97;en>>
The arguments presented by Senator Marti with regards to a similar refuse to invitations coming from the Polish authorities to visit the suspicious locations, quote, we are not forensic science experts, and we have no doubts about the capability of those who would have removed any traces of the prisoner's presence, end quote, seem to disagree with the whole purpose of his investigations, and seem to place an insurmountable presumption of guilt on the country suspected of having participated in the CIA program.

<<1727.97;1739.29;en>>
The government acknowledged the important role played by international organizations, NGOs, and journalists worldwide in uncovering violations of human rights and individual liberties.

<<1739.29;1756.05;en>>
It is, however, important to stress that there is a key difference between human rights activists or journalists who have direct knowledge of certain facts, and those who receive second-hand information from anonymous sources whose credibility cannot be established or even challenged.

<<1756.05;1760.05;en>>
As such, we recall that even in the report of the U.S. Senate Committee,

<<1760.05;1774.43;en>>
it has been concluded that the CIA had leaked inaccurate information regarding the operation of the HPD program, aspect which raises questions about the reliability of the statements of the CIA sources quoted by various reports.

<<1774.43;1790.65;en>>
Returning to the analysis of the Romanian Senate's report, we kindly ask the Court to consider that, even though its annexes have been classified up to a recent date, at no point did the Romanian authorities try to hide behind a wall of state secrecy and national security.

<<1790.65;1799.89;en>>
The relevant, though summarized, information contained in the classified annexes was exposed within the report, being available to all the interested parties.

<<1799.89;1812.13;en>>
In this context, where the Senate's inquiry revealed no element that could be traced in a criminal procedure, such an investigation was initiated immediately after the filing of the criminal complaint by the applicant.

<<1812.13;1824.21;en>>
It is our opinion that the criminal investigation is thorough, supervised by an independent body, and that it offers the representatives of the victim the possibility to effectively participate in its conduct.

<<1824.21;1835.23;en>>
From the beginning of the investigation, the public prosecutor's office established an inquiry plan based on the content of the criminal complaint and on information available in the public domain.

<<1835.23;1845.57;en>>
The vast majority of the activities stated in this plan have already been carried out, the only requests left without an answer being those addressed to the American competent authorities.

<<1845.57;1857.79;en>>
All the institutions that could hold information about the flights put forward as suspicious by various reports were contacted by the public prosecutor's office and requested to submit all the relevant data.

<<1857.79;1867.69;en>>
The prosecutor's office took a particular interest in the identification of personnel working at Baniasa Airport on the dates of the flights allegedly used in rendition circuits.

<<1867.69;1882.91;en>>
Twenty-three witnesses working for the border police, for the private handling agent, Romanian Airport Services, or for the airport security department were heard concerning working procedures, rules of access, and in particular about the end flights.

<<1882.91;1902.29;en>>
On the basis of the witnesses' statements, the public prosecutor's office is able to determine the procedures to follow in the case of the landing of private non-commercial flights, as well as what was the normal flow of passengers and whether there existed blatant breaches of these procedures in the case of the American registered flights.

<<1902.29;1920.25;en>>
As an example, a witness working for the Romanian Airport Services stated that, quote, regarding the American flights with the uncalled sign, as in the case of airplanes flying other flags, my duty was to provide refueling, crew transport from the airport to the hotel, catering services, weather reports.

<<1920.25;1934.69;en>>
Several witnesses identified these flights as having had a technical stop at Baniasa Airport for refueling, and the vast majority of the witnesses stated that the end flights were serviced by the civil handling agent as any normal flight.

<<1934.69;1952.17;en>>
Even the witnesses who noticed aspects that would suggest that the American flights went through a different procedure completed their declarations by stating that, quote, I have not seen persons embarking, disembarking this aircraft, end quote, or that the different procedure was applied in a single case.

<<1952.17;1961.89;en>>
At this point, we have to stress that not all the witnesses serviced the same flights and that, therefore, their declarations should not be viewed as contradictory.

<<1961.89;1968.99;en>>
The criminal investigation took into account all the relevant developments in the public space answering to new information acquired.

<<1968.99;1990.05;en>>
As such, when one of the witnesses raised questions about the involvement of the Romanian Intelligence Service, the prosecution heard an official from this institution who explained his presence on the airport premises and added that the passengers of these flights went through the regular passenger control flow and that no detainees were disembarked from this aircraft.

<<1990.05;2001.85;en>>
Also, high officials were called on by the prosecution to clarify their statements about the object of the agreements concluded with the American counterparts in the aftermath of the 9-11 tragedy.

<<2001.85;2020.87;en>>
Following accusations brought by certain media outlets concerning the possible location in Bucharest at the Orniste site of a secret CIA detention center, the prosecution heard an official working for this institution about the structure of the building and its destination from 2002 onwards.

<<2020.87;2034.85;en>>
Having regard to the available information, the government expressed their view that the criminal investigation carried out by the public prosecutor is effective and that each possible lead has been considered and evidence amassed in order to establish the facts.

<<2034.85;2057.23;en>>
The government admitted that the investigation is still pending four years after the filing of the criminal complaint, but kindly asked the courts to analyze the length of the proceedings in the context of the complex nature of the investigation and of the factors that have an impact on its progress and which are beyond the prosecution's control, such as the unsuccessful efforts to obtain relevant information from the American authorities.

<<2057.23;2076.31;en>>
Lastly, concerning the participation of the applicants' representatives in the criminal investigation, the government recalled its limited scope, as mentioned before, and that according to the Romanian criminal code of procedure, they could have asked to be informed about any act of criminal investigation, as well as to be present when witnesses were interrogated.

<<2076.31;2078.47;en>>
No such demand was submitted.

<<2078.47;2094.51;en>>
Madam President, honorable judges, for all the reasons put forward in our written and oral pleadings, we kindly ask the courts to conclude that no evidence permitting to engage the responsibility of the Romanian state was established and to reject the present application as ill-founded.

<<2094.51;2094.81;en>>
Thank you.

<<2094.81;2094.81;en>>
Thank you.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<2110.04;2125.52;en>>
Madam President and members of the court, in a recently declassified document, the applicant, Mr. Al-Nashry, describes his treatment in various CIA prisons in these words, and I

<<2125.52;2133.68;en>>
quote, from the time I was arrested five years ago, they have been torturing me. One time

<<2133.68;2141.32;en>>
they tortured me one way, and another time they tortured me in a different way. By hanging,

<<2141.32;2148.6;en>>
head was up and legs were pointing downwards. I was hung for almost a month. You doing your

<<2148.6;2157.92;en>>
things basically, and you were hung upside down and drowning and hitting the wall. There

<<2157.92;2165.44;en>>
are many scars on my head if I shave my head. If I shave my hair, the scars will become

<<2165.44;2173.8;en>>
obvious. What else do I want to say? I was without clothes. I was sleeping on the floor

<<2173.8;2186.16;en>>
for about a month. Many things happened. They were doing so many things.

<<2186.16;2192.88;en>>
It was in Bucharest in May of 2004 that Mr. Al-Nashry was subjected to rectal feeding

<<2192.88;2200.4;en>>
after he tried to go on a hunger strike. It was here in a secret CIA prison in Bucharest

<<2200.4;2216.68;en>>
that the CIA infused an enema into his large intestines as he lay helpless, face upwards on an incline, his head forced lower than his torso. A December 2014 U.S. Senate Intelligence

<<2216.68;2223.62;en>>
Committee report confirms this. The report describes rectal feeding as a practice applied

<<2223.62;2238.58;en>>
by the CIA on detainees, quote, without evidence of medical necessity, unquote, and as a means of, quote, behavior control, unquote. It was in Bucharest that Mr. Al-Nashry was subjected

<<2238.58;2254.0;en>>
to all of the standard abusive conditions of CIA detention, incommunicado solitary confinement, blindfolds and hooding, force shaving, continuous noise, continuous light, and leg shackling.

<<2254.0;2261.86;en>>
Expert three at the fact-finding hearing recognized this. And it was in Bucharest that during

<<2261.86;2273.42;en>>
the first month of their detention, CIA prisoners were subjected to sleep deprivation, doused with water, and slapped or forced to stand in painful positions.

<<2273.42;2280.18;en>>
It was in Bucharest that Mr. Al-Nashry inevitably faced the constant fear that the previous

<<2280.18;2295.02;en>>
torture inflicted on him in Poland would be inflicted on him again, leaving him in a state of permanent anxiety caused by complete uncertainty about his fate at the hands of the CIA. The

<<2295.02;2302.46;en>>
court expressly recognized this form of ill treatment in Abu Zubaydah versus Poland. All

<<2302.46;2308.9;en>>
of this ill treatment was clearly in violation of Article III of the European Convention.

<<2308.9;2325.9;en>>
But as recognized by the court in Abu Zubaydah versus Poland, it is not necessary for the court to analyze each and every aspect of the applicant's treatment in detention or indeed the physical conditions in which he was detained.

<<2325.9;2349.02;en>>
For the record before this court, and indeed the court's own previous decisions, clearly establish that torture and prisoner abuse was the hallmark, indeed the standard operating procedure of the CIA's secret detention program. The predictability of the program gives sufficient

<<2349.02;2356.46;en>>
grounds to believe that the applicant was abused in Romania as well as after his transfer from there.

<<2356.46;2362.66;en>>
I will answer the court's first three questions. My colleague, Ms. Hatnianu, will address the

<<2362.66;2364.38;en>>
remainder.

<<2364.38;2380.18;en>>
In response to the court's first question, yes, it is established beyond reasonable doubt that Romania hosted a secret CIA prison from 2003 to 2005 and that the applicant, Mr. Alnashiri,

<<2380.18;2383.74;en>>
was secretly detained in that prison.

<<2383.74;2388.5;en>>
The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report and other documentary exhibits before this

<<2388.5;2396.28;en>>
court as well as cogent and credible expert testimony confirm these facts.

<<2396.28;2403.66;en>>
Expert two testified there was no shadow of a doubt that Romania participated in the CIA program.

<<2403.66;2417.28;en>>
Expert three testified that with the exception of the black site in Afghanistan, the Romanian black site operated for the longest period and held more detainees than any other CIA black site.

<<2417.28;2422.38;en>>
Experts three and four confirmed that the applicant was secretly detained in Romania.

<<2422.38;2428.98;en>>
They also confirmed that the wealth of details about detention site black in the U.S. Senate

<<2428.98;2441.18;en>>
report all correspond to details about the Bucharest prison that the CIA code named Brightlight where the applicant was detained.

<<2441.18;2456.14;en>>
As such, the report by itself, authored by no less than the United States' own Senate Intelligence Committee, based on exhaustive review of U.S. government documents, renders

<<2456.14;2465.36;en>>
untenable the Romanian government's claim that there is no evidence of a CIA prison on Romanian territory.

<<2465.36;2471.28;en>>
In response to the court's second and third questions, yes, Mr. Alnashiri's torture and

<<2471.28;2496.98;en>>
secret detention, as well as his transfer from Romania in the face of real risks, can be imputed to the Romanian state because these acts occurred on Romanian territory with the acquiescence and connivance of the Romanian authorities and because Romania failed to fulfill its positive obligations to prevent these acts despite being on notice that they would occur.

<<2496.98;2510.64;en>>
As expert 3 aptly said, it is quite clear that the Romanian authorities not only should have known, but did know of the nature and purpose of the CIA's secret operations on their territory.

<<2510.64;2537.78;en>>
For the evidence before this court demonstrates that it was the Romanian authorities who gave the CIA permission to run a secret prison in Bucharest, it was the Romanian authorities who gave the CIA permission to use dummy flight plans to secretly land rendition planes carrying prisoners in and out of the country, and it was Romanian authorities who gave the CIA extraordinary security cover for their operations in Romania.

<<2537.78;2546.5;en>>
Expert 3 testified that this level of cooperation depended on authorization by the highest levels in the Romanian government.

<<2546.5;2552.62;en>>
And page 97 of the U.S. Senate report confirms the same.

<<2552.62;2567.98;en>>
As experts 3 and 4 testified, Romanian authorities knew the nature and purpose of CIA activities on Romanian territory because the CIA paid Romania millions of dollars as a subsidy to host the prison.

<<2567.98;2573.02;en>>
Moreover, the U.S. Senate report also establishes that it was at the instance of the Romanian

<<2573.02;2576.76;en>>
government that bright light was ultimately closed.

<<2576.76;2589.46;en>>
The Romanian government demanded closure of the CIA prison within hours of publication of a November 2005 Washington Post article disclosing that CIA black sites existed in Eastern Europe.

<<2589.46;2601.9;en>>
This clearly establishes that as long as the CIA prison existed on Romanian territory, it was with the Romanian government's consent.

<<2601.9;2608.9;en>>
In Al-Nashri v. Poland, the court found that CIA rendition operations, and I quote here,

<<2608.9;2628.86;en>>
largely depended on cooperation, assistance, and active involvement of the countries which put at the USA's disposal their airspace, airports for the landing of aircraft transporting CIA prisoners, and last but not least, premises on which the prisoners could be securely detained and interrogated.

<<2628.86;2657.4;en>>
While the interrogations of captured terrorist suspects was the CIA's exclusive responsibility and the local authorities were not to be involved, the cooperation and various forms of assistance of those authorities, such as, for instance, customizing the premises for the CIA's needs, ensuring security, and providing the logistics were the necessary condition for the effective operation of the CIA's secret detention facilities.

<<2657.4;2660.86;en>>
This is true with respect to Romania.

<<2660.86;2674.38;en>>
Just as the court found it inconceivable that Poland did not know about the secret detention of prisoners on its territory, it is simply inconceivable that Romania did not know that it was hosting a secret prison.

<<2674.38;2678.8;en>>
Mr. Al-Nashri was transferred from Romania with the Romanian government's acquiescence

<<2678.8;2688.16;en>>
and connivance in the face of a real risk of further torture, secret detention, a flagrantly unfair trial, and the death penalty.

<<2688.16;2694.06;en>>
This removal, too, was most certainly imputable to the Romanian state.

<<2694.06;2699.02;en>>
Romania knew, through its own agreement with the U.S. to host a prison in Romania, through

<<2699.02;2711.86;en>>
its own operational involvement in CIA rendition operations, and through countless credible sources at the time of Mr. Al-Nashri's transfer, that the U.S. was secretly detaining prisoners

<<2711.86;2719.44;en>>
on Romanian territory and also transferring them to locations, other locations, in the face of real risks.

<<2719.44;2725.82;en>>
In Al-Nashri v. Poland, the court found that by June 2003, it had been widely known that

<<2725.82;2731.22;en>>
the U.S. rendition program had involved secret detention in overseas locations.

<<2731.22;2738.84;en>>
Romania, which enabled Mr. Al-Nashri's transfers off its territory well after June 2003, indeed

<<2738.84;2748.78;en>>
in 2005, knew by then that there were substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faced all of these risks.

<<2748.78;2754.82;en>>
The applicant has established strong, clear, and concordant facts in support of his claims.

<<2754.82;2759.48;en>>
In contrast, the Romanian government has continued to cover up the truth.

<<2759.48;2764.26;en>>
The government has an unprecedented advantage over the applicant.

<<2764.26;2777.06;en>>
It has all the relevant facts in its possession because it entered into an agreement to host a secret CIA prison, because it operationalized that agreement, and because it covered it all up.

<<2777.06;2783.2;en>>
In contrast, Mr. Al-Nashri, still detained at the remote location of Guantanamo Bay,

<<2783.2;2786.94;en>>
is gagged from speaking of his treatment in Romania.

<<2786.94;2802.06;en>>
Whereas here, the events at issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation.

<<2802.06;2824.5;en>>
Whereas here, the authorities have failed to provide a convincing explanation and failed to conduct an effective investigation despite being on notice at least since 2005 of the fact that Romania hosted a secret CIA prison, the Court is entitled to draw inferences adverse to the authorities.

<<2824.5;2830.26;en>>
Madam President, this case has profound implications for Mr. Al-Nashri, who is still detained at

<<2830.26;2840.96;en>>
Guantanamo Bay in the face of a real and continuing risk of a flagrantly unfair trial by military commission and the death penalty.

<<2840.96;2845.54;en>>
The Court's case law makes clear that even though Mr. Al-Nashri has been transferred

<<2845.54;2856.38;en>>
from Romanian territory, Romania is under an obligation to use all available means, including diplomatic assurances, to preclude these risks.

<<2856.38;2875.86;en>>
This case also has profound implications for the rule of law in Romania and indeed in many other member states that participated in CIA extraordinary rendition, a practice that entailed countless violations of the most basic rights under the Convention.

<<2875.86;2886.16;en>>
Madam President, it is time for the Court to end the impunity with respect to this practice, which it has rightly found to be anathema to the rule of law.

[[JudgeP;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska]]

<<2890.53;2892.93;en>>
Thank you, Ms. Sink, I call Ms. Hatneanu.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<2894.17;2904.07;en>>
Madam President, Honorable Members of the Court, I shall further address a procedural violation of the Convention raised by the present case. On the question of the effectiveness

<<2904.07;2926.17;en>>
of the domestic investigation into the applicant's allegation of torture, ill-treatment and secret detention, the applicant strongly contends that the endeavors the Government is presenting as an effective but ongoing investigation come close to the requirements imposed by articles free of the Convention. Allegations regarding Romania's involvement in the CIA

<<2926.17;2950.61;en>>
rendition program were made public as early as 6 November 2005 in a human rights statement which indicated specific information, such as a tail number of a flight used in rendition circuits which landed in Poland and Romania, years, or the fact that a number of persons were detained outside the USA as part of the program, including naming some. The evidence

<<2950.61;2957.79;en>>
heard by the Court during the fact-finding hearing and the 2014 U.S. Senate report demonstrate

<<2957.79;2969.13;en>>
that the disclosures of November 2005 triggered the domestic authorities' specific request to close down the black site operated in Romania, a request that was immediately answered.

<<2970.13;2980.53;en>>
Nevertheless, the Romanian authorities did not initiate any sort of investigation, despite the severity of the allegations. It is the applicant's view that given the serious nature

<<2980.53;3004.49;en>>
of the allegations, as well as the vulnerability of the potential victims, who are in no position to complain themselves, details which were also publicly known, Romania was under the obligation to initiate ex officio investigations apt to clarify all circumstances and possible victims. It is also the applicant's view that such investigations, in order to meet their

<<3004.49;3009.79;en>>
purpose, could only have been conducted by a prosecutor. It would have been of utmost

<<3009.79;3020.85;en>>
importance for the effectiveness of the criminal investigation to be initiated as early as possible. As the events were very recent, and important evidence, such as fresh witnesses'

<<3020.85;3026.17;en>>
testimony, could have been gathered. If such investigations were opened, it would have

<<3026.17;3041.77;en>>
been possible for the domestic authorities to identify the applicant as one of the victims and to establish when he was transferred in and out and what treatment he was subjected to. If independent investigators were able to establish these facts during subsequent

<<3041.77;3052.53;en>>
research, it would have been possible for official investigators as well, as long as there was a will to such purpose and a constant effort to follow the matter.

<<3052.53;3066.65;en>>
Further information on the existence of the program and the involvement of Romania became publicly known in the following years, and inquiries were instituted by the Council of Europe and by the European Parliament, which resulted in detailed reports. For example,

<<3066.65;3077.13;en>>
the DiCmarti reports were quite specific in describing Romania's involvement in the program and in calling for investigation to take place domestically. The only response was a very

<<3077.13;3088.89;en>>
superficial parliamentary investigation, which fell short of all standards under Articles 3 of the Convention. Although the conclusions as made public in 2008 were very drastic in

<<3088.89;3100.29;en>>
denying any involvement of Romania in the CIA program, they still acknowledged certain facts, such as the existence of flights which were previously mentioned as part of the program.

<<3100.29;3121.57;en>>
Nevertheless, no criminal investigation was initiated at that moment either, although under the criminal procedural code enforced at the material time, the prosecutor was able to start such an investigation on its own motion, as was not bound by the findings of the parliamentary investigation. Nor did the mounting evidence made public since, including

<<3121.57;3133.13;en>>
official US acknowledgments of the CIA's free detention program starting as early as 2006, generate a different approach on the part of Romanian authorities. It was only after

<<3133.13;3145.27;en>>
the applicant was able to lodge a formal criminal complaint in 2012 that such an investigation was opened. Actually, if one closely scrutinizes the documents provided by the government,

<<3145.27;3155.85;en>>
it was only after the present application was communicated to the government that the criminal complaint was taken into account and some very meager steps taken. Even so,

<<3155.85;3162.01;en>>
although four years have passed since, little progress has been achieved. It was only the

<<3162.01;3175.93;en>>
entry into force of a new criminal procedural code on 1 February 2014 that forced the prosecution to open the criminal investigation in REM. Otherwise, the file would most probably still

<<3175.93;3181.77;en>>
be in a preparatory phase. At present, the investigation is still pending against persons

<<3181.77;3192.81;en>>
unknown after more than 10 years since the first reports of Romania's involvement in the CIA program were made public. The prosecution's efforts to build on the vast amount of information

<<3192.81;3206.21;en>>
and evidence in international inquiries or US reports already available in public domain were non-existent. For example, although by 2012 there was a vast amount of information,

<<3206.21;3236.93;en>>
including official US admissions on the existence of a CIA-operated secret edition program as opposed to a military operation, the prosecutor's minutes of 3 December 2012, analyzing the applicant's criminal complaint and the statuses and arrangements regarding the bilateral agreements between Romania and the United States of America, focused on the framework of US military operations in Romania. Even if such an analysis could have made some sense at the end of 2005, beginning

<<3236.93;3256.29;en>>
of 2006, when there was very little information publicly known on the framework of the secret detention program, 7 years later it should have been obvious that information on the US military operations in Romania were completely irrelevant to the matter under investigation.

<<3256.29;3293.53;en>>
Another example of the ineffectiveness of the investigation is the fact that there is no indication in the criminal investigation file that the widely publicized 2014 US Senate report, which must have been known to any diligent investigator given the vast amount of information on the matter it contained, so there was no indication, there is no indication in the criminal files that this report was taken into consideration in any way or that there was any effort to corroborate the information in the report by gathering any additional evidence. In fact, it appears from the domestic case file that the investigation has been

<<3293.53;3298.77;en>>
completely stalled for at least 3 years. With the exception of two witness statements which

<<3298.77;3316.61;en>>
were taken due to a very specific context which I cannot elaborate on due to confidentiality limitations in the case, but which had nothing to do with the US Senate report, nothing at all has happened in the investigation since 2013-2014. Moreover, no information on the

<<3316.61;3321.49;en>>
status of the investigation was disclosed to the applicant or the general public. In

<<3321.49;3332.09;en>>
fact, if it were not for the current application before the Court, the victim and his representatives would have been in total darkness as to the progress of the investigation. We agree that

<<3332.09;3353.53;en>>
given the very specific circumstances surrounding the applicant, contacting him directly would have been impossible, but there was no attempt whatsoever to at least contact the applicant's representatives, let alone involving them in any way in the investigation or informing them on the progress. In this context, the applicant recalls the Court findings in its

<<3353.53;3360.45;en>>
judgment against Poland of 16 February 2015. The Court stated that even if there is a strong

<<3360.45;3382.61;en>>
public interest in maintaining the secrecy of sources or information or material, in particular cases involving the fight against terrorism, it is essential that as much information as possible about allegations and evidence should be disclosed to the parties in the proceedings without compromising national security. Where full disclosure is not possible,

<<3382.61;3393.61;en>>
the difficulties at these cases should be counterbalanced in such a way that the party can effectively defend its interests. Where allegations of serious human rights violations

<<3393.61;3416.29;en>>
are involved in the investigation, the right to truth regarding the relevant circumstances of the case does not only belong solely to the victim of the crime and his or her family, but also to other victims of similar violations and the general public, who have the right to know what has happened. There must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the

<<3416.29;3422.29;en>>
investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. Or, in the

<<3422.29;3427.73;en>>
present case, the domestic authorities failed completely. It was only by chance that the

<<3427.73;3432.29;en>>
information on the witness being heard by the prosecutor reached the media at some point.

<<3432.29;3437.53;en>>
No information was actively made public by the authorities. It is the applicants' view

<<3437.53;3448.13;en>>
that there can be only one possible explanation for such a constant pattern of behavior of the domestic authorities for the past ten years and a half. The lack of will to investigate

<<3448.13;3453.25;en>>
the allegations that Romania was constantly and without any basis denying. Indeed, as

<<3453.25;3464.73;en>>
the second expert testified at the fact-finding hearing, no country implicated in the CIA rendition program reacted with as much hostility towards investigative efforts as Romania did.

<<3464.73;3475.81;en>>
The lack of will to investigate exists also at the highest judicial investigation bodies, that is, the General Prosecutor Office. Results with clarity from the 19 October 2012 letter

<<3475.81;3480.53;en>>
the General Prosecutor Office addressed to the government's agent. The letter is an annex

<<3480.53;3490.93;en>>
to the government's observation of December 2012, in respect of which no request for confidentiality was made. The letter clearly states that the illegal detention of the applicant is out

<<3490.93;3517.61;en>>
of the question, given his status as a high-value detainee, that the various publicly available sources are not to be taken into account by the prosecutor, even if some provided detailed information which could have been corroborated by the official investigation, and that the highest Romanian authorities had constantly denied the allegations, as if such denial would have constituted any basis for the prosecutor to dismiss the applicant's claim.

<<3517.61;3534.01;en>>
Another example of the complete lack of will on the part of the prosecutor to actually investigate the complaint is the sixth document of four pages, annexed to the government's observation of 2015. As confidentiality for this document was granted and no summary was

<<3534.01;3549.65;en>>
provided by the government, I will just kindly ask you to study it and think if anyone could officially ask those questions in writing and actually expect an official answer to be provided to be used in the investigation. Moreover, the lack of an answer should have

<<3549.65;3559.93;en>>
indicated there might be some basis in the applicant's complaint, but such an inference was never made by the prosecutor. An intricate cover-up operation, such as the CIA secret

<<3559.93;3566.17;en>>
detention program, would have required an equally complex and sophisticated investigation.

<<3566.17;3571.77;en>>
The one carried out by the domestic authorities is far from any kind of sophistication. For

<<3571.77;3586.57;en>>
example, asking people that could have not known anything about the CIA operations if they knew something is not only useless, but is quite a serious indication that the investigation looked only in places where there was for certain nothing to be found.

<<3586.57;3598.53;en>>
One can now wonder what would convince domestic authorities to employ adequate means to investigate such a sensitive matter. Would admissions of those involved suffice? Probably not, as

<<3598.53;3603.53;en>>
such admissions were made by the U.S. authorities, even if in a redacted form, to no avail.

<<3603.53;3630.71;en>>
Considering all the previously mentioned elements, the applicant kindly asks the Court to find that the investigation carried out at the domestic level was not prompt, thorough, and effective, or sufficiently transparent, as required by Article III of the Convention, although there was a credible claim that the applicants were subjected to torture, ill-treatment, and secret detention in Romania. On the question of the existence of an effective

<<3630.71;3649.21;en>>
remedy for the purposes of Article XIII of the Convention, for the allegations under Article III, V, VIII, and Article II taken together with Article I, Protocol VI, the applicant maintains that no such effective remedy exists in Romania. The only available

<<3649.21;3660.99;en>>
remedy at his disposal is a criminal complaint he filed in 2012, which, as stated before, proved completely ineffective in his particular case. Moreover, his criminal complaint covered

<<3660.99;3672.81;en>>
all aspects under the mentioned articles, but the prosecutor started the in-rem investigation only to a very limited number of cases of crimes in February 2014.

<<3672.81;3687.51;en>>
This aspect was never communicated to him or his representatives, and he became aware of it only a couple of weeks prior to the present hearing, due to the confidential documents provided by the government. He has now passed a breach to appeal the decision of the prosecutor,

<<3687.51;3693.17;en>>
which was never communicated to him. Therefore, he kindly asks the Court to find that Article

<<3693.17;3696.05;en>>
XIII of the Convention was also violated.

<<3696.05;3696.05;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska]]

<<3698.25;3699.65;en>>
Thank you, Ms. Hatneanu.

<<3699.65;3702.65;en>>
Now I call judges if they wish to ask questions.

<<3702.65;3703.69;en>>
Judge Spano, please.

[[Judge;Robert Spano]]

<<3705.65;3707.65;en>>
Thank you, Madam President.

<<3707.65;3715.95;en>>
I have several questions that I want to pose to the government and also to the applicants.

<<3715.95;3725.37;en>>
Just to put my questions in context, there are three issues that are before the court for us to examine.

<<3725.37;3731.53;en>>
Number one, was a CIA detention site operated in Romania in 2003 to 2005?

<<3731.53;3735.97;en>>
And if so, was the applicant detained during that period?

<<3735.97;3748.57;en>>
And thirdly, if both of those questions are answered affirmatively, can the applicant's detention and treatment in Romania be attributed to the Romanian government?

<<3748.57;3766.65;en>>
So my first question goes to the government's arguments in the papers and also today during the pleadings as regards the Romanian authorities and government's awareness, assuming the first two questions were answered affirmatively.

<<3766.65;3772.49;en>>
In other words, a detention site was there and that Mr. Al Nashiri was detained.

<<3772.49;3789.07;en>>
I want to draw the government's attention to paragraph 441, subparagraph 4, of the Al Nashiri versus Poland judgment, which puts the awareness issue in a chronological context.

<<3789.19;3817.05;en>>
There, the court found that already between January 2002 and August 2003, remember the allegation here is that the detention site in Romania was operational from 2003 to 2005, numerous public sources were consistently reporting ill treatment and abuse to which captured terrorist suspects were subjected in US custody in different places.

<<3817.05;3841.35;en>>
Moreover, in the 2003 PACE resolution adopted in June 2003, of which Poland as any other contracting state, among them, of course, Romania, the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe was, and I quote, deeply concerned at the conditions of detention of captured unlawful combatants held in the custody of the US authorities.

<<3841.35;3851.99;en>>
And the court found all these sources reported practices resorted to or tolerated by the US authorities that were manifestly contrary to the principles of the convention.

<<3851.99;3862.25;en>>
Consequently, there were good reasons to believe that a person in US custody under the HVD program could be exposed to a serious risk of treatment contrary to those principles.

<<3862.25;3897.81;en>>
My question to the Polish government is this, assuming, Romanian government is this, assuming that the first two questions that I mentioned were answered in the affirmative, how would you invite the court to distinguish your case and the circumstances in Romania as regards governmental awareness from the judicial facts found as regards to the situation in 2002 and 2003 in paragraph 441 of the Al Nashir versus Poland judgment?

<<3897.81;3903.29;en>>
My second question goes to the issue, again, of awareness.

<<3903.29;3916.27;en>>
And I want to draw the Romanian government's attention to two documents which I want clarification of, because they were not mentioned during your pleadings here today.

<<3916.27;3939.01;en>>
On 13 December, 2014, an online version of Der Spiegel rendered, publishes an article which deals with information provided by the former Romanian chief of operations Ioan Talpeş.

<<3939.01;3944.45;en>>
In this article, in the verbatim English translation, it is stated that Mr. Talpeş said

<<3944.45;3955.59;en>>
that there were one or two locations in Romania at which the CIA, and I quote, probably held persons who were subjected to inhuman treatment.

<<3955.59;3967.29;en>>
Talpeş had previously confirmed the existence of, and I quote, a CIA transit camp, as he calls them in the Bucharest daily Adevarul.

<<3967.29;3973.41;en>>
On June 8 of this year, the European Parliament issued a resolution.

<<3973.41;4000.93;en>>
In this resolution, in paragraph 13, it is stated, the parliament recalls that the former director of the Romanian secret services, Ioan Talpeş, admitted on record to the European Parliament delegation that he had been fully aware of the CIA's presence on Romanian territory, acknowledging that he had given permission to lease, I quote, lease a government building to the CIA.

<<4000.93;4011.57;en>>
May I please ask the Romanian government to comment on the substance of these two documents and the relevance in the court's assessment?

<<4011.57;4015.97;en>>
My third question goes to the effectiveness of the criminal investigation.

<<4015.97;4018.45;en>>
And my question has two limbs.

<<4018.45;4035.05;en>>
Firstly, may I ask, is it the contention of the Romanian government that the parliamentary inquiry itself concluded in 2008 that in and of itself was effective for the purposes of Article 3?

<<4035.05;4043.97;en>>
In other words, the fact that we have a pending criminal complaint is not necessary for the resolution of the Article 3.

<<4043.97;4062.41;en>>
In other words, if no criminal complaint would have all been invoked or established, then the parliamentary inquiry would itself be enough for Romania to have sufficiently exercised or sufficiently dealt with the issue under Article 3.

<<4062.41;4068.99;en>>
And may I ask in that context, did the parliamentary inquiry have access to classified documents in its analysis?

<<4068.99;4073.63;en>>
I know there is some issue on this in the papers, but please clarify.

<<4073.63;4090.69;en>>
As regards to the criminal investigation, which was based on the applicant's criminal complaint of 29 May 2012, may I receive clarification of what is the status under statutory Romanian law of the applicant?

<<4090.69;4095.91;en>>
Is he a formal victim under Romanian criminal procedural law?

<<4095.91;4107.51;en>>
And if so, you mentioned that he had a right to be notified of procedural decisions and he had a right to be present during witness questioning.

<<4107.51;4113.37;en>>
Could you please clarify what is the extent of his possible victim status position?

<<4116.95;4120.79;en>>
My last question goes to both parties.

<<4120.79;4126.55;en>>
And it deals with assuming that the applicant, Mr. Al Nashiri,

<<4126.55;4131.07;en>>
was present on Romanian territory as a CIA detainee.

<<4131.07;4139.55;en>>
May I draw the attention of both parties to page 73 of the US Senate report?

<<4139.55;4170.07;en>>
On that page, it is stated, and I quote, in October 2004, 21 months after the final documented use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against Al nashiri, an assessment by CIA contract interrogator Dunbar and other CIA interrogator concluded that Al Nashiri provided, and I quote, essentially no actionable information.

<<4170.07;4174.95;en>>
And I quote, the probability that he has much more to contribute is low.

<<4174.95;4200.95;en>>
There is then a reference in a footnote, 372, stating that in June 2005, the detention site Black, which the allegation is the Romanian site, chief of base suspended even these debriefings because it was, and I quote, the very, very rare moment that Alnashiri would recognize a photograph and because the debriefings often were the catalyst for his outbursts.

<<4200.95;4218.63;en>>
May I, on this basis, ask both parties to comment on what they consider to be proven as the application of the EITs, the enhanced interrogation techniques, if the court were to conclude that Mr. Al Nashiri

<<4218.63;4233.11;en>>
was indeed detained in that period, the reason I ask this is because it matters for the qualification by the court of an eventual assessment under Article 3 of the nature of the treatment that the applicant was subjected to.

<<4233.11;4234.35;en>>
Thank you, Mr. President.

Now I turn to Judge Sicilianos.

[[Judge;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos]]

<<4241.45;4243.45;fr>>
Merci beaucoup, Madame la Présidente.

<<4243.45;4253.45;fr>>
C'est une question qui concerne le gouvernement, mais qui pourrait, le cas échéant, être aussi commentée par les requérants.

<<4253.45;4275.45;fr>>
J'ai entendu avec beaucoup d'intérêt les éléments fournis par l'agent du gouvernement au sujet des articles sur la responsabilité des Etats adoptés par la Commission d'ordre international des Nations Unies en 2001 et plus particulièrement au sujet des dispositions de ces articles concernant le problème, la question de l'attribution à l'Etat.

<<4275.45;4284.95;fr>>
Et il ne fait pas de doute que ces articles, du moins ceux qui codifient, qui concernent l'attribution, codifient l'état actuel du droit international général.

<<4284.95;4289.45;fr>>
La Cour internationale de justice l'a affirmé au moins à trois reprises.

<<4289.45;4308.95;fr>>
Mais de notre côté, le rapport du Sénat américain de 2014 avance et répète constamment que tous les sites de détention de la CIA en Europe et ailleurs ont pu fonctionner dans le respect de la souveraineté de l'Etat concerné, dans le respect de la souveraineté de l'Etat concerné.

<<4308.95;4317.95;fr>>
Et j'aimerais savoir comment est-ce que vous comprenez cette affirmation au regard des règles applicables en matière d'attribution que vous avez mentionnées.

<<4317.95;4319.49;fr>>
Merci beaucoup.

[[JudgeP;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska]]

<<4319.95;4321.39;en>>
Thank you, Judge Sicilianos.

<<4321.39;4322.39;en>>
Judge Streteanu, please.

[[Judge;Florin Streteanu]]

<<4326.26;4329.26;fr>>
Merci beaucoup. J'ai deux questions.

<<4329.26;4337.26;fr>>
La première adressée au gouvernement, la deuxième adressée aux représentants du requérant.

<<4337.26;4382.26;fr>>
En ce qui concerne la question posée au gouvernement, j'aimerais revenir un petit peu sur les statuts de vol qui ont atterri, notamment sur l'aéroport de Bonaissa, le gouvernement a soutenu dans ses observations écrites et aussi aujourd'hui dans sa plaidoirie, que ces vols n'avaient pas un statut spécial en ce qui concerne l'immunité pour les personnes se trouvant au bord de ces avions, ni à part le fait qu'en général on a soutenu qu'il s'agissait tout simplement des scales techniques.

<<4382.26;4423.26;fr>>
Vu ces affirmations, j'invite le gouvernement à préciser sa position à l'égard de l'incident souffert le 6 décembre 2004, incident impliquant l'un de ces avions et à l'égard duquel le rapport rédigé par le Parlement européen fait mentionner le fait que les personnes se trouvant au bord de cet avion sont tout simplement disparues sans avoir pu être vérifiées, sans avoir pu être enregistrées par la police de frontière.

<<4423.26;4430.26;fr>>
Donc j'aimerais avoir la position, le commentaire du gouvernement à l'égard de cette affirmation-là.

<<4430.26;4484.26;fr>>
La deuxième question, adressé au representant du requérant, dans la mesure où, supposons que les requérants aient été détenus sur le territoire roumain, d'après les représentants du requérant, quel a été le pays tiers vers lequel le requérant a été transféré après sa détention en Roumanie et savoir si ce transfert vers ce pays tiers a aggravé de quelque façon que ce soit la situation juridique ou personnelle du requérant, ça veut dire à l'égard de son statut juridique, à l'égard du régime de détention, à l'égard des sanctions applicables, etc.

<<4484.26;4484.26;fr>>
Merci.

<<4486.31;4488.15;en>>

<<4947.0;4948.46;en>>
Please be seated.

<<4954.8;4959.4;en>>
The Court resumes the hearing and I call Ms. Brumar.

<<4959.4;4959.4;en>>
The floor is yours, Ms. Brumar.

[[Government;GR1]]

<<4961.41;4963.53;en>>
Thank you, Madam President.

<<4963.53;4986.85;en>>
In responding to the questions put by the honorable judges, the first question related to the distinction that we would like to invite the court to make vis-a-vis its findings in the Al-Nasiri versus Poland judgment.

<<4986.85;5034.61;en>>
As I tried to explain in our oral submissions, it is our reading of the judgment that the court not only established objective elements as to the existence of facility, as to the treatment that the applicant was subjected to, but also subjective elements pointing to the attitude of the state, pointing to its knowingly permission granted to third authorities to use its territory for activities implying human rights violations.

<<5034.61;5051.41;en>>
And if my reading of that judgment is correct, the court put an emphasis on the fact that in the Polish case, the procedures were extraordinary.

<<5051.41;5063.65;en>>
The location was under the security control of the Polish authorities.

<<5063.65;5129.57;en>>
The way the planes landed, the location of the airport, the way the planes were treated by the authorities with the exclusion of the personnel usually working in the airport, the unusual method of payment were all indications that together with what the court calls the acceptance of Polish authorities of a false landing permit, construed an image of an authority that is aware and that is participating in disguising the way the program is functioning and the traces that this program leaves.

<<5129.57;5136.45;en>>
In the case of Romania, all the planes were treated.

<<5136.45;5148.89;en>>
And the documents that we presented and attached to our observations confirm all the planes were treated by the normal standard procedure.

<<5148.89;5150.65;en>>
There was an incident.

<<5150.65;5151.85;en>>
It was noted.

<<5151.85;5158.97;en>>
And the prosecutor made further inquiry in order to clarify it.

<<5158.97;5169.73;en>>
No evidence suggests that these planes or their destination is disguised.

<<5169.73;5213.89;en>>
When they decided unilaterally to change the destination, either by using the alternate destination that was already assumed when filing a flight plan, either by changing the destination in flight, these aspects were mentioned and recorded in various documents, handling fees, charge notes, record of flights that the Romanian authorities produced.

<<5213.89;5240.37;en>>
There was no indication that something unusual, extraordinary, out of the procedural standards was happening that, combined with the objective elements that you mentioned in your question, would have directed the Romanian authorities to consider that something suspicious is happening with these planes.

<<5240.37;5245.57;en>>
That was our submission.

<<5245.57;5266.13;en>>
And it is true that from 2002, various information, including at the Council of Europe level, warned about the treatment of prisoners or detainees under US custody.

<<5266.13;5285.05;en>>
But as expert number two stated yesterday, only at the end of 2005, the information that Eastern European countries were involved emerged in the media.

<<5285.05;5293.25;en>>
It is not our contention that the Senate inquiry alone would in itself be enough to deal under Article III.

<<5293.25;5314.49;en>>
We consider it important to present the work and conclusions of the Senate committee in our oral submissions because, on one hand, valuable information was contained in the findings of the commission and in the annexes of the report.

<<5314.49;5333.69;en>>
And on the other hand, because the Romanian Senate report is an important element in assessing the prosecutor's obligation to initiate ex officio a criminal investigation.

<<5333.69;5362.25;en>>
And in the case of another state, when the parliamentary inquiry reached different conclusions on possible existence of secret facilities, they suggested, and other authorities combined their suggestions with the parliamentary one, suggested the initiation of a criminal investigation.

<<5366.25;5385.47;en>>
As far as the status of the applicant in Romanian law is concerned, there is no such thing as formal victim status position that would be recognized after following a procedure in criminal law in Romania.

<<5385.47;5395.21;en>>
By filing a criminal complaint, the author of that criminal complaint declares himself as an injured party.

<<5395.21;5406.89;en>>
The commencement of criminal investigation is not an authorization of the victim status.

<<5406.89;5426.53;en>>
Actually, under criminal procedural law, the prosecutor is to commence a criminal investigation in all cases except if some instances that would not allow for a criminal inquiry to take place are not met.

<<5432.29;5468.21;en>>
As far as the news article in the Spiegel is concerned and the way that article quotes from the former director of external intelligence service, as you can see from the document that we adduce to the file, that information was also verified in the context of the criminal investigation.

<<5468.21;5482.69;en>>
And in that context of the criminal investigation, it appeared quite clearly that the way that Spiegel used not only Mr. Talpes's statements,

<<5482.69;5491.81;en>>
but also another high official statement was misleading.

<<5491.81;5504.53;en>>
The statement referred to the normal level of cooperation between Romania and US, including at the level of intelligence agencies.

<<5504.53;5530.09;en>>
They confirmed that a location was provided as residence, as headquarters, for CIA in Romania for representation purposes, as usually done in NATO member states.

<<5530.09;5543.69;en>>
I would kindly and respectfully draw your attention to the fact that in two different occasions, Mr. Talpes

<<5543.69;5566.73;en>>
clarified what he actually meant by his statements that were rephrased and misinterpreted by the news agency.

<<5566.73;5590.01;en>>
So as far as the incident in December 2004 is concerned, following the accident that took place in the airport, an investigation, a technical investigation, was initiated.

<<5590.01;5602.97;en>>
The chief inspector, after an in-situ inquiry, concluded on the causes of the accident.

<<5602.97;5608.01;en>>
And the report is publicly available on the internet.

<<5608.01;5642.45;en>>
The report stated that the passengers were disembarked using the doors of the aircraft, and that as there was the risk of a fire burning out, as large amounts of fuel were leaking from the aircraft, they were obviously and normally taken away from the airplane.

<<5642.45;5645.33;en>>
The passengers did not vanish.

<<5645.33;5657.45;en>>
And I would recall you that yesterday, expert number one confirmed that he was provided the list of the passengers.

<<5657.45;5661.33;en>>
The list of the passengers was taken from Romanian authorities.

<<5661.33;5670.49;en>>
And the only way you could have the list of the passengers is if they passed through normal border controls.

<<5670.49;5674.57;en>>
They were later taken to a hotel, and then they left the country.

<<5674.57;5681.17;en>>
There was no vanished person during that incident.

<<5685.25;5696.05;en>>
The US Senate report of 2014 is definitely a valuable source of information.

<<5696.05;5707.93;en>>
And it's value rests, among others, on the fact that it is an official release by US authorities.

<<5707.93;5739.53;en>>
However, and I will refer that to the question with reference to the concept of sovereignty used in US Senate report, I consider, and I would not dare to speculate further on that, that the use of sovereignty in that report and in general is a different concept from that of responsibility.

<<5739.53;5772.29;en>>
And I would not know what the US authorities meant by saying that they respected the sovereignty of states concerned, but that could range from respecting the airspace of the states they transited and would not imply by that the fact that they searched the informed cooperation of other states with respect to running secret detention facilities.

<<5772.29;5774.53;en>>
As far as the treatment, Mr. Anaschiri

<<5774.53;5780.45;en>>
was subjected to a while in a secret detention in Romania.

<<5780.45;5820.29;en>>
If we assume that such a secret detention existed, and if we assume that we can draw the conclusions that the black country indicated in US Senate report that took the care to redact part of its findings is Romania, as the applicants' representatives contend, I would remind you that expert number three yesterday confirmed that while in Romania, Mr. Anaschiri

<<5820.29;5837.97;en>>
was not subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques and that actually the pattern of the program, the expert said, was that the enhanced interrogation techniques were used only at the beginning of the detention of a HVD.

<<5837.97;5847.33;en>>
Thank you very much for your attention, Madam President.

[[JudgeP;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska]]

<<5848.01;5852.01;en>>
Now I call Ms. Singh.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<5852.51;5853.79;en>>
My colleague will begin.

[[Applicant;AP1]]

<<5856.51;5870.51;en>>
Madam President, I will start this time with a short rebuttal mostly on what the government has said and also a few other comments, also having some of the questions, and then my colleague will go further on the merits.

<<5870.51;5890.51;en>>
The government has raised the issue of non-exhaustion of actually several objections. One would be the fact that this application was filed too late, another one being that actually we have not exhausted domestic remedies.

<<5890.51;5910.51;en>>
And one thing that was mentioned was that we have not explained why we have waited for some public admission or indication on whether, on where the black site in Romania was located in order to file a criminal complaint and then actually go also to the, before the court.

<<5910.51;5930.51;en>>
Well, there is a very simple explanation why we have waited for such an indication to become publicly known. We expected the sort of attitude that the domestic authorities actually had, the blunt denial and the requirement on us to provide as many information as possible.

<<5930.51;5945.51;en>>
As you could see from the case file, even all the information we provided was not considered enough by the prosecutor to make, to go into further examination of the evidence we proposed.

<<5945.51;5959.51;en>>
So we consider that we need as many elements of fact as possible in order to file both the criminal complaint and afterwards the complaint before the European Court of Human Rights.

<<5959.51;5970.51;en>>
On the other hand, also we expected that there would be no effective investigation given the attitude of the authorities so far.

<<5970.51;5984.51;en>>
So we have tried to put up a case as strong as possible on one hand, and on the other hand, afraid that we might be considered as outside time by the court, also filed the application before the court.

<<5984.51;5994.51;en>>
We were considered not serious, let's say, in our efforts because we have not waited for the domestic authorities to act.

<<5994.51;6004.51;en>>
But look, we were right in our assumptions that we are four years later and no serious investigation ever took place.

<<6004.51;6016.51;en>>
The government also pointed out to various inconsistencies in the facts presented by us, including regarding the location and so on.

<<6016.51;6036.51;en>>
It is our interpretation that if there is anyone's fault for the inconsistency, that is on the government, because they were under the obligation to investigate the allegations and to make findings in respect of all these details of fact.

<<6036.51;6060.51;en>>
So it was too much to put the whole burden on us to provide very, very, very consistent and clear details beyond what is required under Article III of the Convention for an Applicant, and only that to trigger an effective investigation.

<<6060.51;6081.51;en>>
I think that the facts and the attitudes of the authorities in this case is that if the burden of proof completely reversed, it's like the government is a defendant, like in the regular procedure, and the applicant, and I'm talking about the domestic investigation here, not the court procedure.

<<6081.51;6091.51;en>>
The applicant is the one who has to provide all the evidence, and the authorities, may it be the Senate, may it be the prosecutor, just rebut everything.

<<6091.51;6093.51;en>>
It's not enough.

<<6093.51;6095.51;en>>
You have not proven anything.

<<6095.51;6106.51;en>>
No, the authorities in Romania do not have a right to remain silent, and there is no obligation on the applicant to prove their guilt.

<<6106.51;6113.51;en>>
It's their obligation to conduct an effective investigation.

<<6113.51;6134.51;en>>
Also, the government made some consideration about our lack of participation to the domestic procedures, and I also make a bit of comment regarding your question about the status of the judge's plan or about the status of the applicant in the domestic procedures.

<<6134.51;6143.51;en>>
In the case of the judge, he filed a criminal complaint in which also he mentioned he wants remedies.

<<6143.51;6150.51;en>>
So he asked for the status of a civil — not of an injured party alone, but of a civil party.

<<6150.51;6164.51;en>>
So that came into force on 1 February 2014, which made the prosecutor to start in rem criminal investigation.

<<6164.51;6176.01;en>>
But on the other hand, based on the new provisions of criminal procedure, there should have been an act on informing the applicant on its rights.

<<6176.01;6178.51;en>>
That was never — that never happened.

<<6178.51;6194.51;en>>
And as you see, not even the government admits that he has the same status that he would have throughout the procedure since the very beginning, that is of an injured party, but also of a civil party.

<<6194.51;6214.61;en>>
The civil procedure code does provide — the new one does provide for certain rights, and it is the law and the practice in Romania that after the prosecutor opens the criminal investigation, to inform the civil party and the injured party at the same time of his or her rights.

<<6214.61;6218.01;en>>
Something like that never happened in the present case.

<<6218.01;6241.01;en>>
And as a last comment I would like to make about the Senate investigation that is presented here as an effective investigation for the purposes of Article 3 and that there was no need for an ex officio investigation to be started by the prosecution.

<<6241.01;6248.01;en>>
The Senate report has a very, very strong conclusions as that nothing happened here.

<<6248.01;6263.51;en>>
As I said, for the prosecutor, even after the applicant filed a criminal complaint, that strong denial was very important in considering that there is no case to investigate, as in the letter addressed to the government agent.

<<6263.51;6272.71;en>>
But nevertheless, no one looked in detail of how the report was made and what it was based on.

<<6272.71;6275.51;en>>
The annexes to the report were never made public.

<<6275.51;6277.21;en>>
Never, ever.

<<6277.21;6289.91;en>>
It results that some were declassified in 2013 from the documents the government sent during — I mean, since the last months in this procedure.

<<6289.91;6294.41;en>>
But publicly they were never made public.

<<6294.41;6307.81;en>>
So there was no ground whatsoever to correlate the very, very strong denial containing the findings with some sort of basis.

<<6307.81;6325.61;en>>
Given the fact that there are also all these contradicting international reports on the market, so why would someone in good faith would take for granted this very strong conclusion without any other indication?

<<6325.61;6335.51;en>>
Even the fact that, although there were public statements that the documents should be declassified, they were never declassified, were not taken into consideration by the prosecutor.

<<6335.51;6356.41;en>>
And also, it has to be noted that these documents do not prove, like this 11 annexes that were almost lost until now, do not prove much of the effectiveness of the investigation.

<<6356.41;6363.71;en>>
Again, there are thousands of flight logs that have nothing to do with our issue.

<<6363.71;6380.81;en>>
It's about overflying authorization from the Ministry of Defense, which obviously doesn't result that anyone took into consideration those thousands of pages in any way.

<<6380.81;6388.81;en>>
Actually, the Senate only requested a three-page summary in order to assess it.

<<6388.81;6403.91;en>>
It also has to be noted that when the Senate, after releasing the report, was actually asked in a Freedom of Information request that is also in the file, what was the purpose?

<<6403.91;6407.01;en>>
Why did these planes actually land in Romania?

<<6407.01;6407.91;en>>
Okay, we understand.

<<6407.91;6415.21;en>>
You say there was no involvement of Romania into the program, but you investigated it.

<<6415.21;6416.21;en>>
Why did they come here?

<<6416.21;6419.51;en>>
Okay, they didn't carry detainees, but why they were here?

<<6419.51;6425.21;en>>
The official answer of the Senate was that was not the purpose of the investigation committee.

<<6425.21;6425.21;en>>
Thank you.

[[JudgeP;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska]]

<<6427.18;6428.62;en>>
I call Miss Singh.

<<6428.62;6429.74;en>>
The floor is yours, madam.

[[Applicant;AP2]]

<<6432.77;6433.61;en>>
Thank you.

<<6433.61;6438.01;en>>
If I may answer the questions raised by the judges.

<<6438.01;6465.19;en>>
With respect to Judge Spanos' question as to what we consider to be proven with respect to enhanced interrogation techniques, it is the applicant's position that in light of the extreme secrecy associated with the program, that we cannot rule out the possibility that he might have been subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques.

<<6465.19;6490.23;en>>
This said, the finding by the court that the totality of circumstances that the applicant was subjected to clearly amounted to torture and treatment in violation of Article III, we submit, is entirely warranted by the evidence in this case.

<<6490.23;6537.63;en>>
And in support, I would draw the court's attention to 18 months of incommunicado detention and enforced disappearance to which the applicant was subjected, the evidence of rectal feeding, which the Senate report said was applied without medical necessity and as used as a method of behavior control, the conditions of confinement that are documented in a number of documents that were recognized by the court in Al-Nashri versus Poland, including the document signed by George Tenet and another from the CIA relating to Rizzo's office, John Rizzo's office.

<<6537.63;6551.67;en>>
And these conditions of confinement included continued subjection to bright lights, continued subjection to loud noise, shackling, blindfolding, hooding, force shaving.

<<6551.67;6577.95;en>>
And in fact, as expert three categorically said in yesterday's fact-finding hearing that drugging and beating were also such kinds of sort of routine elements of the treatment to which prisoners were subjected along with the conditions of confinement documented in numerous official US government documents.

<<6577.95;6608.19;en>>
Then also, as I mentioned in my opening statement, the court in Abu Zubaydah versus Poland recognized that the mere fact of secret detention combined with the uncertainty of being detained at the hands of the CIA itself inflicted intense mental suffering on the applicant, another element of the treatment and violation of Article III that the applicant was subjected to.

<<6608.19;6620.43;en>>
And then finally, the personal characteristics of the victim are also relevant for determining the standard of ill treatment that he was subjected to.

<<6620.43;6659.75;en>>
And I'll draw the court's attention to numerous documents in the record that demonstrate that the applicant was psychologically utterly broken as a result of the CIA detention program, including the transcript testimony of Sandra Crosby, who said that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, and also, in fact, numerous passages from the Senate report itself, the US Senate report itself, that document the severe psychological breakdown to which the applicant was subjected.

<<6661.63;6683.19;en>>
With respect to Judge Stratianu's question, the expert testimony of expert number three yesterday indicated that the applicant was likely taken to Lithuania after his detention in Romania.

<<6683.23;6700.65;en>>
But in relation to your question as to whether that aggravated the legal position of the applicant, the answer is most certainly yes, because he remained in continued CIA secret detention.

<<6701.27;6727.75;en>>
And so for all of the reasons that the court found that there were violations of the convention by Poland in permitting the detainees transfer from Polish territory into further secret detention in CIA custody, the same logic applies with respect to Romania, because he was not suddenly free and being subjected to criminal process in Lithuania, or indeed any other country.

<<6727.75;6732.59;en>>
He was subjected to the CIA secret detention program.

<<6733.75;6758.55;en>>
And I just draw the court's attention to the fact that certainly that risk, Romania was on notice of that risk of continued secret detention, continued ill treatment, the possibility of an unfair trial by military commission that's all clearly set out in our application, the military commission's order number one that was issued in 2001, and the death penalty.

<<6761.11;6771.25;en>>
All of that, the Romanian government was on notice of as of the time of transfer, which we heard yesterday occurred in 2005.

<<6773.07;6794.09;en>>
And so certainly that is, according to the court's caseload, that is the point of time that you should consider for determining that the country was on notice that transfer was taking place in the face of these real risks of further ill treatment, death penalty, fragrantly unfair trial, secret detention.

<<6794.09;6800.71;en>>
But the court has also found that it is entitled to take into account post-transfer facts.

<<6800.71;6830.89;en>>
And again, I would point, I would respectfully submit that the evidence in this record is replete with information that demonstrates that the real risks that existed as of the point of transfer from Romanian territory continued and in fact manifested while he was held in Lithuania and indeed while he's held in Guantanamo Bay.

<<6830.89;6846.23;en>>
And then finally, I would just submit that in, it is perplexing that the government continues to believe that there is not sufficient evidence to demonstrate that there was a secret CIA prison on Romanian territory.

<<6846.23;6853.43;en>>
We have heard exhaustive testimony yesterday from the expert witnesses.

<<6853.43;6855.03;en>>
We have the Senate report.

<<6855.03;6861.19;en>>
We have numerous documents appended to the application and the written submissions of the applicants.

<<6861.19;6878.97;en>>
And we have very specific accounts from expert number three that he actually spoke with individuals who had firsthand knowledge of these dummy flight plans that were concocted with the cooperation of the Romanian government.

<<6879.99;6885.27;en>>
So I would respectfully submit there's ample evidence in the record to find for the applicant.

<<6885.27;6886.11;en>>
Thank you.

<<6887.72;6888.88;en>>

      <text>The conclusion may be drawn with special regard to the principle of the rule of law that granting of disability pension in 2001 created for the applicant a reasonable and legitimate expectation according to which she could expect to receive disability benefit as long as she satisfied the criteria applied in 2001, and, of course, if there was no reason for the withdrawal under the rules which were enforced at that time.</text>

      <text>Thus, if the Honorable Court followed the Chamber's majority decision and handled the unlawfulness of the 2010 withdrawal as if it was decided, it will build the applicability of the 2012 claim through establishing legitimate expectations on this basis on an alleged but unproven unlawfulness violation stemming from the 2010 withdrawal concerning which the court itself said that it doesn't have the right to examine.</text>

      <text>As one of the closing remarks, the government wished to emphasize that when a similar case arises where there is an ex-eligibility element, but the applicant's property claim for benefits doesn't have a domestic law basis anymore, taking into consideration the issue of lawfulness, unlawfulness as concerns the continuity of legitimate expectation in itself is not a flawed idea from the court.</text>

      <text>Any person who asserts they believe they are subject to a threat will have the reasonableness of that belief examined and will have called against them, if necessary, in a criminal trial the facts that demonstrate that belief is either unjustified or, even worse, completely confounded by the facts as evidenced by the witnesses who speak of what happened.</text>

      <text>And any person who asserts an honest belief in threat in circumstances where it is objectively unreasonable is likely to be prosecuted, because the very unreasonableness of the belief will provide a basis for a prosecutor saying, this is a case in which, objectively, the belief stated can't be supported, and therefore, there will have to be a case brought before the jury.</text>

      <text>With respect to Judge Spanos' question as to what we consider to be proven with respect to enhanced interrogation techniques, it is the applicant's position that in light of the extreme secrecy associated with the program, that we cannot rule out the possibility that he might have been subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques.</text>

      <text>This said, the finding by the court that the totality of circumstances that the applicant was subjected to clearly amounted to torture and treatment in violation of Article III, we submit, is entirely warranted by the evidence in this case.</text>

      <text>And in support, I would draw the court's attention to 18 months of incommunicado detention and enforced disappearance to which the applicant was subjected, the evidence of rectal feeding, which the Senate report said was applied without medical necessity and as used as a method of behavior control, the conditions of confinement that are documented in a number of documents that were recognized by the court in Al-Nashri versus Poland, including the document signed by George Tenet and another from the CIA relating to Rizzo's office, John Rizzo's office.</text>

      </meta_data>
      <text>And in fact, as expert three categorically said in yesterday's fact-finding hearing that drugging and beating were also such kinds of sort of routine elements of the treatment to which prisoners were subjected along with the conditions of confinement documented in numerous official US government documents.</text>

        <Language>en</Language>
      </meta_data>
      <text>Then also, as I mentioned in my opening statement, the court in Abu Zubaydah versus Poland recognized that the mere fact of secret detention combined with the uncertainty of being detained at the hands of the CIA itself inflicted intense mental suffering on the applicant, another element of the treatment and violation of Article III that the applicant was subjected to.</text>

        <Language>en</Language>
      </meta_data>
      <text>And I'll draw the court's attention to numerous documents in the record that demonstrate that the applicant was psychologically utterly broken as a result of the CIA detention program, including the transcript testimony of Sandra Crosby, who said that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, and also, in fact, numerous passages from the Senate report itself, the US Senate report itself, that document the severe psychological breakdown to which the applicant was subjected.</text>

        <Language>en</Language>
      </meta_data>
      <text>But in relation to your question as to whether that aggravated the legal position of the applicant, the answer is most certainly yes, because he remained in continued CIA secret detention.</text>

        <Language>en</Language>
      </meta_data>
      <text>And so for all of the reasons that the court found that there were violations of the convention by Poland in permitting the detainees transfer from Polish territory into further secret detention in CIA custody, the same logic applies with respect to Romania, because he was not suddenly free and being subjected to criminal process in Lithuania, or indeed any other country.</text>

      </meta_data>
      <text>And I just draw the court's attention to the fact that certainly that risk, Romania was on notice of that risk of continued secret detention, continued ill treatment, the possibility of an unfair trial by military commission that's all clearly set out in our application, the military commission's order number one that was issued in 2001, and the death penalty.</text>

        <Language>en</Language>
      </meta_data>
      <text>And so certainly that is, according to the court's caseload, that is the point of time that you should consider for determining that the country was on notice that transfer was taking place in the face of these real risks of further ill treatment, death penalty, fragrantly unfair trial, secret detention.</text>

      <text>And again, I would point, I would respectfully submit that the evidence in this record is replete with information that demonstrates that the real risks that existed as of the point of transfer from Romanian territory continued and in fact manifested while he was held in Lithuania and indeed while he's held in Guantanamo Bay.</text>

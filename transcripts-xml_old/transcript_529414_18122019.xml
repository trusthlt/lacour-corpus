      <text>We also understand that coming on behalf of the shareholders inevitably means that the scope of this action is more limited than if we were representing the banks, simply because of the fact that the rights restricted on behalf of the shareholders are much more limited, these are simply the rights to vote and the right to sell the shares, than the rights of the banks, which are much more lengthy as the act introduced several infringements relating to the banks, which are, as we are representing now, the applicants, not the subject matter of this procedure.</text>

      <text>This was not simply, first of all, this never happens in case of a normal financial regulator, but more importantly this database was also shared with each and every members of the integration, meaning that when our bank would have been obliged to upload all of its data to this database, each and every competitors of this bank and each and every other shareholders through their banks would have had the opportunity to see all their data relating to their clients.</text>

      <text>Now there was also a reference in the government's argument relating to the regulatory regime in relation to the, I assume it must have been the CRR regulation, which provides that national authorities may waive the application of capital requirements and it also answered the question of Mr Dedov, this is indeed based on the Basel Accords, but this is not the Basel rules themselves, but this is the European implementation of these rules.</text>
